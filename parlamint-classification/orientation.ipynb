            "[{'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> Matteoli (<PARTY>). Mr President, on behalf of the Forza Italia Group, I wish to express my condolences to the families of the eight victims of the Livorno flood and solidarity with the city. I am particularly attached to Livorno, because he elected me for ten years city councilor and for five years provincial councilor. When a family, the typical Italian family, composed of its father, mother, grandparents and grandchildren, lives in symbiosis and suddenly a wave of water and mud overwhelms it and leaves only a two-year-old girl alive and grandmother, or, in a couple, the wife dies leaving her husband, it is clear that we have to ask ourselves why. Fortunately, the General Insurances made a gesture, which I appreciated and which I believe all colleagues also appreciate: they will think of the future of the child, since both the grandfather and the father had an insurance agency of the Generals. Is there the imponderable element? I don't know. But I know that Livorno doesn't have a river; Livorno has a well-organised canal, a channel dating back to the Medici's time, and which has never created problems. If a disaster such as this happens, it is evident that man is to blame. But I never liked the fact that, when tragedies of this nature occur, before thinking of helping those who are in difficulty or trying to restore the city to its rules, try to find the culprit. There will be time and way to understand if there are responsibilities, and it is not our job, but it will be the task of the judiciary to be able to acclaim it. That torrent was buried seventy or eighty years ago; it even seems to me that it was buried in 1933. Now, go and look for the responsibilities, as has happened in these days, between the municipal administration of Livorno and the Region, of why that stream has been buried, when it is now seventy or eighty years that this has happened, seems excessive. Of course, the city administration of Livorno doesn't have the same political color as I do, but I don't feel like throwing myself at it, as it happened. Above all, I hope that the central government, the Region and the Municipality will work together with Livorno, in order to restore the city in its regulation. I believe that man must ask himself - said Senator Filippi just now - about what has happened and what he has done in recent years: he has used the territory for profit, without thinking about future generations. It is time to think about future generations and invest in trying to secure the territory. I know that the cost is very high, because there have been studies by technicians, who have found huge figures. However, if we never begin to bring the territory back to its origins, we will certainly not be able to solve the problem. If necessary, we must also have the courage to tear down what has been built, to try to prevent disasters from happening in the future like what has happened in the city of Livorno these days.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6827530860900879, 0.31724685430526733]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> IN MAY (<PARTY>). Mr President, I would like to take advantage of Senator Buccarella's request, which is shared by all the leaders, to bring to your attention a motion which I would have liked to raise at the end of the sitting, of course. I believe, however, that the subject is so important that it is worth considering now. I find the statements made by Undersecretary Delrio almost paradoxically true when he says that politics has nothing to do with these facts, but this denunciation dramatically that, perhaps, twenty years have passed in vain, if it is true, that we find faces and faces already known twenty years ago. I therefore believe that it is very important - and I am asking you, Mr President - that the President of the Council should come and report back to the Senate.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6468212604522705, 0.3531787097454071]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, in my speech during the general debate at first reading on this measure, I stressed the positive value of the legislative text under discussion, because it is a page-by-page text compared to a long period in which labour law has considered self-employment to be ontologically unrelated to its scope. At last it is recognized in an organic and accomplished way that also the self-employment has some requirements of safety, but of which the contract cannot be carried out between the parties, except to correct the eventual distortions deriving from situations of substantial economic dependence of the provider from the buyer or from abuses of dominant position from the latter. This is the approach that we find correctly in Articles 2 and 3 of the legislative text. The security needs of the self-employed provider can and must be met in the context of the social security relationship, as the measure very appropriately does. <p> On this first part of the new law - not to repeat myself - I merely recall everything I said in my speech on 26 October. Also on the second part, consisting of Articles 18 to 23, I recall the positive notations carried out in that intervention which, however, limit themselves to the appreciation of the ratio laws, the understanding of the legislator to promote and favor what is now baptized as agile work, that is, the working relationship in which, for a specific temporal segment, the work performance is exempted from the contractual constraint of spatial-temporal coordination, thus assuming the essential traits of the autonomous performance, even in the context of a subordinate employment relationship. However, since there has been an unusually broad convergence of consensus in both this part of Parliament and the other part of this bill, I should like to propose some critical remarks on this second part of the text, a voice outside the choir, without this being considered as a misguided note. It is clear that these comments are not aimed at further amendments, since the text is intended to become a law at last and it is useful for it to become a law at once. However, it is also useful that these observations remain in the minutes in future memory, so that if the practical experience of the application of the new law shows that they have some basis, it can be taken into account in future legislative adjustments. The risk I see is that the provisions contained in this Chapter II of the measure may reduce the agility of the relationship which, on the other hand, we want to promote and preserve. The agility is not preserved if the agreement between the parties is weighed down with unnecessary transaction costs that seem to me to be born from our pernicious tendency, especially in the field of work, to the hyper-regulation, to the legification of every aspect of the relationship, even where there is no use of it, except for the ministerial bureaucrats (for these, in fact, the legislative complication involves the function of priests of the sacred mysteries, that is to say interpreters of the legislative text through circulars) and for the class of labour consultants and lawyers, to whom I belong, whose work is made indispensable. It constitutes an unjustified increase in transaction costs even the only hypertrophy of the rules, the production of legislative texts in which twenty lines say things that could be said in one line or, worse, unnecessarily repeats with new words what is already said by a general norm in reference to a particular case. Each new rule gives rise to the effort of interpreters to identify any minor difference in meaning that can be identified in each new word used by the legislator. Moreover, even the addition of those twenty lines to say nothing new constitutes an increase in transaction costs because it obliges all operators to hire a consultant to ensure that the new law does not have a change in the old discipline. I'll just give you two examples. In months of discussion on this new legislative text, I have not found anyone who has explained to me what to add to Article 21 to the general rules applicable to all working relationships in the field of remote control. These seven lines of the Official Journal that we add are completely useless and harmful to the complication of the lives of citizens that they themselves entail for the mere fact that they have been added. Similarly, in months of discussion on this text, I have found no one who has explained to me what Article 22 adds to the general protection of the safety of the employed person. This is even a matter of fifteen lines that are totally useless. In terms of the clarity and legibility of the legislative text, it is not appreciated that Article 24 has been inserted in this draft law in the Chamber, containing a provision on social security contributions for house assistants in Bolzano. It can be understood that the new law imposes on the parties the obligation to conclude the agreement on agile work in written form, even if this constitutes a small weight more than the current order, which instead allows the oral agreement. If it is also required that the written act defines - I quote - the reforms of exercise of the employer's managerial power and the instruments used by the worker (Article 19) and then it is added that the same written act must identify the conducts, connected to the performance of the performance of the work outside the premises of the company, which give rise to the application of disciplinary sanctions (Article 21 (2)), it is obliged, without any appreciable reason, the undertaking of small and medium size to avail itself of a consultant or lawyer in order to fulfil this obligation. The counselor and the lawyer, on the other hand, gives himself a cat to be bald not easy. What can be written usefully in the written agreement about the forms of exercise of the governing power towards the agile worker or about the particular conduct that can give rise to disciplinary sanctions when the performance is destined to take place outside the perimeter of the company and in the times freely decided by the worker? But above all, what kind of protective function can these two provisions have in practice? What is the abuse of the governing power of the employer or the disciplinary power that is being prevented? If we do not answer these questions, it means that these rules have no reason to be, and then it would be better not to have them included. If that first formal constraint, referred to in Article 22, appears to be of little use and potentially harmful, even more so it must be said of the obligation to hand over to the worker and to the representative of the workers, at least annually (each year this double written fulfilment must be repeated), a written information in which the general and specific risks related to the particular method of execution of the employment relationship are identified (Article 22): we are on the nail in the park bench, to which the rapporteur mentioned just now. Here I note that, in the vast majority of cases of agile work, which already exists and is already practiced in many cases in our productive fabric, this form of work consists of an activity carried out by computer connected at a distance with the organization of the company, where the additional risk, the differential risk of working at home, or where you prefer, is frankly very little appreciated. Another question would be whether this obligation was imposed only where there is a specific additional risk, therefore not in any case and even repeating the fulfillment every year, but only in cases where, for the substances used or for the machinery to be used, which is moreover more from work to home of the last century than from agile work of the 21st century, in the performance of the activity outside the premises of the company there is a concrete additional risk. In my speech last October I observed on this point that the mistake that is repeated here is the same that characterized a large part of labour legislation in the past season. On every occasion we promise the economic operators simplification of legislation and abolition of unnecessary obligations, but then, when we want to promote agile work, we fall into the temptation of the hyper-regulation and the imposition of obligations that do not exist in any order that we know, I speak of foreign laws. And this must make us think, because when an additional fulfillment exists only in Italy and in no other country, even in those much more advanced than ours on the ground of agile work, an alarm bell must trigger and warn us that perhaps we are sinning for the umpteenth time of regulatory hypertrophy.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.56864333152771, 0.43135666847229004]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, I will be very brief in explaining the other points that have been the subject of amendments to the House. <p> I will say very little about the banks, because the debate on the stability bill has been almost totally absorbed by this issue. I would just remind you that in the Chamber it has transposed Decree-Law No 183 of 2015 concerning the resolution procedures of the Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara, Banca Marche, Banca Popolare dell'Etruria and the Cassa di Risparmio of the Province of Chieti. <p> The House has introduced on this subject a solidarity fund in favour of subordinated bondholders up to a maximum of 100 million euros that will be fed by the interbank fund for the protection of deposits, for the management of which a regulation and a decree of the President of the Council of Ministers must be issued, after hearing the competent Commissions, for the choice of the referees. <p> In financial matters another important rule has been introduced concerning the single register of financial advisors, which transposes a bill approved here in the Senate. <p> Another important issue included in the Chamber concerns security, for which €2.6 billion has been allocated, through the establishment of a fund for the enhancement of cybernetics and cybersecurity interventions and equipment for €150 million; a fund for the modernisation of instrumental equipment and equipment of police and firefighters for €50 million; a fund for extraordinary national security and defence interventions in relation to the terrorist threat for €245 million, as well as the bonus of €80 per month for members of the Forces of Order. Another measure has been introduced, which has passed under silence, but which I believe is important, always in the area of security, which concerns citizens in their homes: a tax credit of 15 million euros has been inserted for the video surveillance and alarm systems that citizens will insert into their homes. Little has been said about this, but I think it is an important issue. Important interventions have also been planned on the cultural front: I quickly remember the card for young people who are eighteen years old who will be able to use for cultural activities, but also the fund of 500 million euros for the regeneration and redevelopment of degraded areas. With regard to culture, education and university in general, the measures that had already been introduced in the Senate have been strengthened; in particular, the measure concerning scholarships, to which EUR 50 million have been added, has been strengthened, and measures have also been reinforced concerning those who study in conservatives, because a one-off bonus of EUR 1,000 for those who buy musical instruments has been added. A substantial part of the speeches concerns the South, a subject we discussed so much about in the Senate and which we had ideally entrusted to our colleagues in the House. With satisfaction we can say that the debate discussed here has been fully understood since the House has included a multi-annual tax credit, from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019, for the investments of the enterprises of the eight regions of the South, differentiated according to the size of the enterprises: 20% for small enterprises, 15 for the mediums and 10 for the large ones, with a roof also in this case differentiated according to the size of the enterprise. The increase in the decontribution for new recruits to the South has also been accepted, but will start from 2017, as it will be conditional on both the authorisation of the European Commission and the recognition of the resources available in the Rotation Fund for the implementation of Community policies. I would like to stress that special attention will be paid to the recruitment of women in the context of this measure, if resources are available. This is also a subject that has very little to do with the debate, but I think it is a very important measure. The Mezzogiorno has also been allocated 20% of the Guarantee Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises to enterprises in the regions of the South. So this part of the maneuver that we had entrusted to the work of the House has found full implementation and great satisfaction on our part. Important measures were also launched for companies in general, despite the postponement of the reduction of IRES to 2017. A Fund of 300 million was introduced for export credit and the internationalisation of the production system. Another measure was also accepted, about which we had talked a lot here in the Senate, which concerns the deductibility of IRAP on seasonal workers. In fact, the House introduced the deductibility to 70 percent of the labour cost for seasonal workers employed at least one hundred twenty days a year. We believe that this is a very important measure for companies that use seasonal workers, especially tourism workers. Important health rules have been included, with the release of recruitments for emergency working hours and rest shifts for doctors and nurses, and new rules on the professional responsibility of health workers, as well as important rules in the social field, such as the card for discounts to families with at least three minor children. Another part of the relevant rules, which has little to do with the debate but which we consider to be significant, concerns games. An increase in the single draw has been introduced, from 15 to 17.5%; a reduction in the odds of winnings has been envisaged; moreover, additional equipment will not be allowed, except in place of existing ones. Then there are important innovations concerning the production of legislation in the sector, which will have to be the subject of agreement in the State-Regions Conference and local authorities. Finally, there is the most important rule regarding the absolute prohibition of advertising on generalist TV from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. There have been so many other important rules. I quote one for all concerning the RAI canon. We had allocated part of the extra revenue to additional exemptions for pensioners and we had not managed to make a rule on local TVs, which was accepted to the House. For the sake of a brief debate, as the time is short, I am limited to the most important measures and I too join in the thanks of my colleague for the work she has done at first and second readings because, thanks to the commitment of everyone, the offices, the President, the majority colleagues and, above all, those of the opposition, we have managed to get to this House with the mandate. With regard to the draft budget law, which is also the subject of the House's vote, I ask the Presidency to be able to supplement my speech with a brief report, to be annexed to the Minutes of the sitting, as the House has been subject to very few and very limited amendments. <p> I call the minority rapporteur.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5617543458938599, 0.43824565410614014]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, members of the Government, ladies and gentlemen of the majority but, above all, of the opposition, which - let us remember - unanimously voted in favour of the rule from which today's motions were born. <p> : evidently a flash of lucidity in the dark that has gripped you for a few months! <p> I am happy to be able to explain this motion because it should finally put an end to all the instrumental polemics that we have had to read and listen to in the last two months (in fact, legends rather than polemics, but it is the same). <p> The outskirts call provided for the financing of 120 projects of municipalities, the capital of Province and Metropolitan Towns. They were divided into 24 projects for which a first allocation of funds had been made available and 96 projects which should have received a second allocation. On these 96 projects you have created the problem that we have solved: reality is very simple. <p> If it were not clear to you yet - but it is clear that you know, otherwise you would not have voted in favour of the rule - after the first 0.5 billion allocated to the initial 24 projects, the Government Gentiloni Silveri tried clumsily to allocate further 1.6 billion later for the remaining 96 projects, forgetting, however, to carry out all the passages planned by law. <p> The Constitutional Court, however, has not distracted itself, unlike you, and has judged the use of the allocated fund to be unconstitutional without prior agreement with the Regions, as required by the law. As if that were not enough, a number of requests were then received from the Presidency of the Council of Ministers to postpone the interventions, since in fact many of the projects were not yet in fact ready. Parliament, then, had to intervene for a double purpose: firstly, to adjust the financing, using the funds this time for a purpose permitted by law and going to unblock the budgetary surpluses for all 8000 Italian municipalities; secondly, to postpone the effectiveness of the agreements concluded by 2020. Basically, we repaired inherited damage and legislated for the good of all territories. <p> Going further - but here we are going to add a new concept and we do not want the efforts to be a little too intense on the part of the minority - it must be remembered that the conventions have not been blocked, so the administrations could also proceed independently with their own resources or otherwise, for example by lighting up forms of financial anticipation. In any case, following what Prime Minister Conte promised during the meeting mentioned, which took place on 11 September with the National Association of Italian Municipalities (ANCI), with the motion to our examination the Senate commits the Government on two fronts. Firstly, to provide for specific measures in the 2018 budget law to ensure, in line with a more effective allocation of available resources, appropriate solutions to the authorities of the local authorities concerned, which are awarded assistance financed from the outlying fund. Secondly, to provide for the reimbursement of the costs of interventions already incurred by the territorial authorities which have signed the conventions.

In fact, we try to reform every time an important reality like RAI and we always make reforms that, so to speak, leave a piece behind, that is, are not complete. Reforms are being made that show that there is a partisan interest in those who propose them, in those who support them, in those who approve them, in those who bring them to this House by showing the positive aspects, of course for him and for the majority. <p> There are those who, on the other hand, who want to think at 360 degrees, look at all aspects, including the critical aspects, including the downside of the medal, who highlight well the limits of this way of working, of these reforms, of this way of proceeding in the reforms that never leads to an accomplished result, but which obliges from time to time - every luxury - to intervene in order to make reform of the reforms - so announced - which then turns out to be nothing more than a further reform, which will therefore require a further change and a further discussion in five years' time, again committing Parliament to say that it was actually right that someone took action a few years earlier and that it could well be done then, but it did not happen. It is therefore likely that this will happen in a few years' time and we will see a film - pass me the term, since we are talking about RAI - that we are living today and that those who have already been present in Parliament's classrooms for some time have also seen it on other occasions. <p> A few days ago I was talking to a person who was born when television did not exist yet, but there was only one radio channel, so it was certainly not a good time to do democratic information, that information that was actually needed by people. I believe that the spirit of this reform should make us think, because I would not like to find myself having a RAI that, with one or more channels, has the same address, the same way of acting, that is to give information in a unique way, to give information channeled, to make a certain kind of show and entertainment that in its depth still contains messages that are launched and that go in the direction of giving a clear political support to someone, because this would return to a system of information that is certainly not democratic, that nobody wants. <p> The RAI itself, as it is reformed, with the type of board that is prefigured, with the forecast of a mode of operational management placed in charge of subjects that is hypothesized today in this discussion to be of the great managers, should undergo a radical transformation, because it is removed from the control of the parties, in how much is made a selection finally based on the abilities, the merit, what should be natural in the management of a great company like this, but I fear that in the end will happen what has happened so far: a few decades ago it was said, when it was a question of public recruitment, that one had to assume, out of three people, a socialist, a Christian Democrat and a good one; in RAI, instead, a socialist, a Christian Democrat, a communist and a good one. I believe that, in the end, perhaps by changing the definitions, those who will have to manage the RAI will hardly be able to escape this logic, because however the choice made on his name will be of a political part and the guidelines and the pressures will not be lacking. So the merit, the true abilities, the possibility of emerging and enhancing a great heritage of experiences that we have in the world of communication, entertainment, television and film making in our country, will be dispersed again. That would be a further serious responsibility for voting in favour of this measure. We have put so many questions to the attention of the House, starting - in order to be ground - from the canon, which is imposed on us to watch a television even if we do not want to watch those channels; it must be paid even if, as in my mountain areas, you do not see the RAI channels; it is imposed on us even if to see those channels you have to pay for the installation of a parable and a receiver. It almost seems that you want to be an evader if you say that you take refuge on the channel of another TV operator because those of RAI cannot be seen. There are citizens who are being persecuted because they have not paid the RAI canon perhaps for a fair protest, because they do not agree with the information methods that are being carried out, or simply because it is impossible for them to enjoy that kind of service. Yet no distinction is made. This is another of the issues that should be addressed and that should lead everyone to reflect on the need to maintain an instrument, a means of financing such as the RAI canon, which is certainly unfair, also because it is paid in an uneven way - I say with a smile - throughout the country. The canon is paid by those who feel as a moral obligation and life the payment of taxes and taxes; but there are also the usual smart ones, who prefer another kind of philosophy of life and who do not feel the weight of having to pay the State the RAI canon. Unfortunately, as I said, the payment of the fee is not homogeneous throughout the national territory, because there are areas where its escape seems to be a very practiced sport. The problem of the canon, however, is not the only one to be addressed and discussed. There are also other issues, such as thematic channels, which must have their own functionality, purpose, audience. While it is true that it is important to give some kind of information to citizens regardless of the percentage points of audience, it is equally true that there are content that needs to be updated and brought to all citizens with a purpose, if we want, also of cultural growth. Just go to Spain to see Vaughan TV to understand how Spanish state television on digital terrestrial uses this simple means to teach children, and also to those who are no longer children, English, making a continuous transmission in Spanish and English for twenty-four hours with differentiated levels of difficulty, continually beating iron on how grammar works, syntax and how we should express ourselves in the language of Albion. From this point of view there are many things that could be done, but that are not taken into consideration because perhaps we prefer to continue to propose thematic channels that have a small audience, but do not have the cultural importance that could instead allow us all to make a qualitative leap in our life and in our personal relationships with subjects who are not citizens of this country. If we then have to talk about the privatization of RAI, then we go back to the beginning of the intervention; it is an infinite story, which becomes the banner, the flag of so many electoral campaigns, but then, in essence, it is absolutely not accomplished and carried forward, also because the carriage, as it is managed, is difficult to sell on the market. Drastic action should be taken, and this would also involve reactions, which are understandable, of course, in trade union terms and in the defence of employment levels. The problem perhaps, even in that case, is whether we should look at a company like RAI for its purposes, intended to give information and entertainment to citizens, or for the purposes of employment, job creation, some of which are absolutely unjustified and overpaid. This, in fact, would be another issue to be addressed: whether there are RAI leaders or managers to whom wages and monster allowances are given is something that should be discussed morally. It must be understood whether there is indeed a return or whether it is appropriate that that kind of compensation and that kind of amounts be granted by the free television market and not by a service which should be public and therefore also calmed down. Perhaps for many subjects the importance of working for RAI, for a serious company, if such a reality were to be achieved, would also overcome the economic discourse and the importance of the level of remuneration. In that case, it would become a reference point of a nation with regard to information and therefore would participate in the creation of an institutional credibility and communication, in a reality, such as that of RAI, which can and must be redeemed after so many years of crisis and after so many dark years, which are the result of the work carried out and are to be attributed to the responsibility essentially of everyone. No one can say that it has not, unfortunately, contributed to the situation that has arisen. Now, as I said, we have to tackle the issue of reform, which is also linked to the concept of public service. The public service is not so much to be defined on the basis of who makes it, but rather on the basis of the content of the same, that is to say, what you want to give as information, as communication and entertainment to citizens, but also depends on the way in which you do it: also on the possibility to enhance, as I said before, the reality of our country, the territories, to make known unknown villages, the possibility, for example, to explain to all citizens that not only French cheeses are good. Just go to the valley of which the President of the Assembly is originally at this time, the Val Brembana, to know that there exists in Italy a reality that has more DOP dairy than all France; those products are perhaps not known and are not known, but they are products that Italian citizens - we first living in this country - should know. Yet no one cares about that and comes to us to propose the experiences on the area of champagne, explain how beautiful Reims is, how beautiful the area where Dutch cheese is made, how beautiful the area of Belgium and Belgian breweries and nobody goes to look at our excellences, despite the Expo, despite we have a territory that produces many good and positive things. No one goes to show the excellences, even of industrial or craft type. We still have many, despite the crisis, thanks to these entrepreneurs who fight and defend themselves with their teeth. Let us, however, show the great American realities. It is more interesting to show the Silicon Valley or Google, Facebook, Apple than to make it clear that there are realities that are affirmed in the world, that have headquarters in our country, often in the North, and that they are able, still today, to be competitive. We don't notice them and we only look at giants because they are the ones that hit the imagination the most. They are the ones that we think are best known also abroad, but then if we go abroad we realize that many of our products are also known outside our national borders and that they are not so known by those who live inside. We need a more comprehensive, 360 degree way of training, involving the territories and allowing all realities to express themselves. From this point of view, it is also wrong to merge RAI offices, which we are thinking of doing in these weeks, because it means denying the importance of the territories themselves. This isn't spending review, but a bad choice that leads to erase identity; it's completely wrong as an address because that's not where you have to cut it; that's not where you have to intervene. It is not that way of doing information (which is of great interest to citizens because it is closest to them, especially in peripheral situations) that must be affected. Moreover, the success of certain local televisions - I am talking about the historical ones - in some realities testifies to this: the local news of provinces with a million inhabitants manage to have even about 250,000 spectators every evening. Transporting them on a national scale would have TG1 or TG5 numbers. Things like this need to be taken into account when it comes to reform and when it comes to new boards and again how to administer a RAI that I would not like to be distant from these lines of thought. There is a fundamental problem with communication. I used to say that when I set the example of the person I spoke to a few weeks ago who told me that, when he was born, there was only one radio channel and there was no television and that the only information came from that radio channel. Here, I would not want to go back to that time when, despite the presence of several radio and television channels, there were still the same communicative address and the same political direction as these media, with the result of being subservient exclusively to the wills and expectations of the Government. That would be the wrong choice and the worst result that can be achieved with the approval of this reform of yours. It is right to point out that it is your reform because, despite all the proposed amendments we have made, we have not seen any mention of assent or sharing and, therefore, it remains your proposal, your responsibility. There is clearly still a majority reform, which, as I said at the beginning, is by no means complete. It is a reform that, leaving a piece behind, will force Parliament in the coming years to return to this matter again and probably to say that not myself, but many other colleagues who spoke yesterday and today on this issue were right in their speeches. So we're missing a chance.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5463507175445557, 0.45364928245544434]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> PELLEGRINI Emanuele (<PARTY>). Mr President, I have listened to the introductory report and the brief explanations of vote on this draft law, which - as the rapporteur has rightly pointed out - is a parliamentary initiative. The first question I ask myself is why priority has been given to a bill of parliamentary initiative, when there are many ratifications of government initiative, even more \"older\" from the point of view of the date of subscription, but they lie in the Commission. Our Group does not support the ratification of these amendments and I repeat on these amendments, because the Lega Group is absolutely in agreement with the spirit of the International Criminal Court, where it is going to punish particularly important war crimes. From the debate that has been held in the Commission and even today, I assume that perhaps we are not realizing what we are going to vote on. In particular, Article 8-a, which is one of the subject of these amendments, introduces something dramatically close to the concept of objective responsibility that exists in our legal system: when Article 8-a introduces the crime of aggression, so it is said that the person who has a position to exercise effective political or military control is being persecuted, and this is a binding limitation in order to ensure that the proceedings are carried out before the International Criminal Court, this body is being given a very large and extremely delicate power. And unfortunately we have seen too often that these institutions are sometimes not linear in certain decisions. We fully agree that it is appropriate to provide the particularly strict rules to ensure that the perpetrators are affected, but I also see that this House does not realize what we are doing and the importance of the rules that we are going to vote on. These measures, moreover, have received some criticism, not from the political side to which I belong, but from scholars and academics of all nations, who have first diminished the fact that concrete application will be extremely limited, because these binding limitations will make it virtually impossible to apply this rule in practice. Then there is another rule, in Article 15-a, which perhaps has not been stressed enough. We should stress that this rule applies only to those Member States which have materially ratified the amendments. All right, because up to now there are about thirty of them who have ratified them, but then there is a clause, the so-called output clause, in which it is said that if a ratificationing State believes that it should disassociate itself, this cannot be the subject of a measure within the International Criminal Court. Well, I do not think we should use the instrument of ratifications, as we usually do in these classrooms, voting as it were in a closed box, without going specifically and without understanding the effects from the legal point of view (because here we are talking about a criminal court) and without understanding the real effects on individual states in the world that could be affected in the future by really difficult situations. On the other hand, I believe that we could give the international institutions a real boost if we too, in our seats, were to pay more attention to the rules that we are going to adopt. Indeed, if the application is correct, we are truly pursuing the principles of international law.

We are in the Senate House and the discussion and debate that is taking place there should facilitate, promote and promote the best understanding of the issues, removing the spectrum of ideological issues that seem to be centered around the very delicate issues that we are talking about and which we must approach without prejudice and above all, if I may, documenting in a responsible and correct way the statements that are being made. On the pollutants present in vaccines, even the numerous analyses commissioned by anti-vax movements have certified that the presence of mercury is so low that it is almost homeopathic and that it is higher than that present in water, air and food that we ingest. Let us therefore avoid that politics is above science and let us instead make sound and responsible politics orient the decisions of this House according to scientific assessments. It is paradoxical, ladies and gentlemen, that this legislature began by talking about the case of Stamina and ends with the case of vaccines; two emblematic cases that form a paradox in which, in one way, we have witnessed the tentopolies of those who supported, promoted and pushed the legislator to allow access to therapeutic methods without scientific foundation and, on the other, where the scientific foundation exists (since it is acquired internationally that the vaccination practices represent the greatest achievement after water purification) we have introduced, on absolutely serious bases of insinuations and resounding scientific unfoundedness, the culture of the suspicion that induces the population, not to be opposed, but to be confused. I therefore hope, Mr President, that the examination of the amendments will take place under a different inspiration, on the basis of common sense and reasonableness, because we can still improve the measure and clear out those shadow cones that still exist, in order to deliver to the country not only the truth, but also a measure that really protects the health of the people.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6684538722038269, 0.3315460681915283]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> LIUZZI (<PARTY> (DI, GS, MPL, RI)). Madam President, I would like to announce the vote in favour of the measure by the Group of the Great Autonomous and Freedoms, which has different sensitivities within it, but all convergent in recognizing the celebratory, ethical and promotional data of the measure under consideration. I should also like to draw the House's attention to something that perhaps little has been highlighted, namely the opportunity, to be considered extraordinary, of a reference to a common vision, based on roots, traditions and values that the national community could draw from this measure in order to find points of view of a collegial and collective nature. On this opportunity is founded the attempt not only to recover identity, but also to find unifying meeting points also in the environments in which culture is articulated. I am referring clearly to the school, to the centres of design and cultural execution such as academies, universities and conservatives, to the many study centres, to the same society Dante Alighieri, to the institutions of Italian culture abroad, which could contribute to creating a collective vision based on values of national concord. These values could also serve as a model for a global society, which is increasingly breaking down and directing its attention to detail, so that the values contained in Italian literature (with reference to Dante Alighieri) or in Italian painting (with reference to Raffaello Sanzio) and in Leonardo's work can be affirmed. I am opening a small parenthesis on this subject. It seems to me that this point of view has been grasped, also for the identifying aspects of Italianity and Italian genius, in one of the most important multinational companies based in Italy such as Finmeccanica, which for a few months has changed its name and has acquired that of Leonardo precisely in homage to the great genius, representative of Italianity in the world. These are the reasons why we believe that the measure has the dignity to be discussed in a House of Parliament and that Parliament takes the time to put the right points on this issue. I should like to conclude by making a point which refers to the famous Article 6 of the draft law, namely the provisions on the declaration of national monuments. It almost looks like a fig leaf; since we know that there is a vexed question about the modalities and precariousness of the procedures, so so far we have never understood how we come to declare a monument of national value, we wanted to take advantage of this measure to remedy it. I believe that this could have deserved an autonomous and independent measure, which would have served as a handbook for one or more municipalities or regions (as stated in Article 6) interested in declaring a national monument a civic good, a historical good, an architectural good or an artistic good. From this point of view, the draft law is almost used as an escapism, but I believe that, with a separate provision, we would have had the opportunity to give great dignity to this right need on the part of the local communities, in order to see recognized a good that belongs to their own history and to their own tradition, elevated to the dignity of a national monument.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.604917585849762, 0.39508238434791565]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> ROMANO (<PARTY>).

Madam President, Senators and Senators, I am in favour of the Group for Autonomies-PSI-MAIE, which clearly needs an argument and a brief analysis that goes to substantive and justify the vote in favour of the conversion of Decree-Law No 185 of 25 November 2015 on urgent measures for interventions in the territory. In the decree-law, obviously, there is a variety of initiatives and statements of quite strong positions, among which I would highlight only some, those that have a greater social impact and, even more, a greater impact of social ethical order as well as of an economic type. I refer in particular to Articles 1 and 2, Article 5, which deals with the subject of the Expo, Article 12 on civil service and Article 15 on sports facilities in urban suburbs. Articles 1 and 2 essentially refer to the grant of long-awaited works, always postponed, if not forgotten, to be carried out in the area of Bagnoli and the land of fires in Campania. Unfortunately, the representation that in recent years has given an extremely negative image to the Campania Region, has never found definitive answers, or exhaustive solutions and, obviously, has always ended with the postponement of measures that had a concrete implementation. Well, the commitment on the part of the Government - and of all of us in expressing our confidence - on the two issues means a definitive act, with concrete terms and measures, as regards environmental reclamation and urban regeneration, both for the territory of Bagnoli and for the land of fires. The ecoballs - which are for the truth (and is not a play on words) surely bales of waste, industrial or urban, but how ecological they are is not yet given to know - there deposited and that from 2000 to 2009 have become millions require urgent, immediate and extremely controlled intervention, as well as the decree-law prepares. It is no coincidence, unfortunately, that Italy undergoes infringement procedures that ended with a double conviction - a first sentence dates back to March 4, 2010 and another, more recent to July 16, 2015 - which provides a lump sum penalty of 20 million plus a further daily penalty of 120,000 euros and I believe that this, already in itself, implies the need to intervene very quickly. It commits itself, therefore (and here the passage is very important also regarding the timing, the urgency and the control by the Government), the President of the Campania Region to give rise to an extraordinary plan of interventions that includes in a precise way the disposal of the waste, the reclamation of the sites and the environmental redevelopment, as well as - where possible - the restoration of the state of the places and also - where possible - the eventual return of the areas held for rent or in other title. We could say that this can represent nothing but a continuation of an act of will, of a wish, on the part of the Government and on our part, yet it is not so and for a very simple reason. Within the framework of the decree-law there are extremely precise terms and, not by chance, the protocol stipulated by the National Anti-corruption Authority, also called ANAC, with the Campania Region applies, as regards the plan itself. In addition, the President of the Campania Region must prepare and implement, after the approval of the Regional Council, an operational deletion of interventions and, if this does not happen, will intervene the State with the exercise of substitute powers. These are elements of great punctuality for the removal of ecoballs to take place definitively and irreversibly. Otherwise, it would be a continuous delay, always to future times or to better times. Another sensitive topic is the one dealt with by Article 5 and with the provision aimed at promoting the valorization of the areas in which the Universal Exhibition of Milan 2015 has just ended. In this area there is a dual purpose, the first of which, with a clearly urgent nature, is to ensure immediately an adequate valorization of the site. This objective is enriched, to us it seems, with a further value, because it gives rise to a financial intervention of the State aimed at guaranteeing the initial contribution for a project that someone might call ambitious (but if you do not aspire to something great you do not reach anything) and that is to the realization of a technological scientific pole, in collaboration with the Italian Institute of Technology. I believe that this is an extremely positive aspect and can also represent a further driver for the development of research, in which there are different demands on the part of not only all of us, but also of the scientific community itself, to implement research and also to allow concretely researchers and intelligences, who normally find themselves expatriating after having trained in Italy, to return to their homeland or to find directly on the Italian territory a further development and a concrete realization of the educational paths undertaken. Of course someone might wonder: why the Italian Institute of Technology and not others? The dialectic and the diatribe on the subject to which to attribute this priority, this burden and also this honor, would have led to spend months, I would say years, in the choice of the excellent regarding the good and so on, without having concluded anything. I say this in the knowledge that indicating the collaboration of the Italian Institute of Technology does not mean - I want to emphasize it to my fellow senators - the exclusion of any other authoritative research institute that already exists in Italy, and in Italy of authoritative and accredited research institutes worldwide there are. To think today that research can be attributed, in the sense of monopoly, to a single institution or to a single group I believe it is a reflection without foundation because research develops in the interrelationship and collaboration between several institutions and groups, at national level and, even more, at international level. I would like to dedicate a further consideration to Article 12 of the Decree-Law, which has its ethical and social value; responding to different requirements for the protection of the territory in a social rather than security sense. In particular, the rule provides for urgent financial measures for national civil service interventions, with an increase in the National Civil Service Fund of EUR 100 million. I believe that this declination of Article 12 is, in the social sense, of great importance, because it gives the possibility to the civil service to be supported and accompanied in the important social role it plays. Madam President, if I may, I would like to make a final comment on Article 15, which refers to the implementation of sports facilities. There has also been a great deal of discussion about this. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. I invite you to conclude, Senator Romano. ROMANO (<PARTY>). I shall conclude quickly, Madam President. Article 15 recalls the urgent need to encourage the establishment of sports facilities in urban suburbs. In the historical contingency of the last few months we know how abandoned urban suburbs that do not find a valorization can be forge and outbreak of situations of social distress that can also lead to other criticalities. Implementing the ability to practice sports, even under the control of the CONI, can be of great social importance.

Behind the screen of the alert made in the interest of the integrity of the public administration, in fact, there is an attempt to lower the threshold of protection that, before an accusation, belongs to every citizen. In this case, in fact, the transmission of the complaint to the criminal court is only possible: beware that it is not a limited case. It has already happened that the mayor of a large city had transmitted acts to the DAC and that this Authority had limited itself to expressing an opinion instead of recognizing elements of suspicion in a given appointment, except then realizing the thing late - when the media scandal broke out - transmitting the acts to the competent prosecutor of Rome. So much for the mandatory relationship in case of criminal offences! Behind the screen of the alert carried out in the interest of the integrity of the public administration is, therefore, a great hypocrisy. In order not to engage in the referral of possible offences to the judicial authority, a parallel sanctioning apparatus is created, which passes through the administration and arrives at the DAC, which will be satisfied even if only with a principle of proof, without soliciting the most rigorous scrutiny (clear, unique, concordant) that requires, precisely, criminal judgment. In other words, whenever you think you can't try a corruptive episode, it will be much more convenient to attest to the minimal hypothesis of mala gesto, to punish in disciplinary - or, worse still, extra administrative, thanks to the determinations of the DAC - those who have no way of defending themselves, staying, precisely, hanging by a thread. Yeah, because at some stage of the criminal trial the defendant gets to know the name of the accused, he gets to know about it. In fact, one of the fundamental elements of the defence is to demonstrate the lack of credibility of the accuser. How do you get the same result in an administrative judgment in which this name, sooner or later, doesn't come up? The need underlying the text is right, but it had to be met differently, without lowering the level of guarantees. My proposal, when examining draft law No 19, was also more rigorous. Amendment 5.0.302, which I signed, was intended to punish with arrest for up to six months, anyone who publishes in whole or in part, even as a summary or as a token of information, the identity of the reporting agent, until the preliminary investigation was in progress. However, I kept myself, not by chance, within the criminal procedural system, respecting the point of balance - provided for there - between the responsibilities of each person: accused, accused, judge, all in the light of the public debate. The Presidency, however, preferred to declare it impossible to give space to this text which derogates from the most basic procedural guarantees. Since we are here, I would like to point out another anomaly in the parliamentary management of this text, which had initially been referred to the Justice and Constitutional Affairs Committees. Shortly after his arrival from the Chamber of Deputies, with reference to this draft law, the radical MPs of the last legislature presented petition No. 1,538, which proposed the extension of the possibility of whistleblowing also to employees from the Chambers. It was also referred to the Commissions and there it remained, even after, with questionable decision, the bill passed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs alone. Therefore, today we cannot talk about the intelligent proposal of the radicals, which also called for overcoming the self-dedication, in the name of the principle of equality between citizens and, therefore, among all civil servants. We do not understand, in fact, why continue to exclude, at least from the already existing Severino legislation, an administrative niche that in the past has signalled Opacity. If, for example, Scarpellini has paid VAT on the rents of the House of 2011 (as established by the judgment of the Rome Court this week), perhaps those who ran the contract on the renter's side are also required to know. If the content of the petition had been law, we would have all noticed it before and, perhaps, the discredit for the institutions that bear the weight of these situations would have been less. However, there are responsibilities of the legislator: ambiguous, contradictory and uncertain laws in their definition and exhaustiveness, grey areas desired or irresponsibly determined. They are also the basis of a general state, in addition to being missing any preventive administrative control that, precisely, does not act in a precautionary way, questioning - indeed, sanctioning - administrative acts that do not conform to the law. There are responsibilities of administrators, mayors and presidents. In the anti-Mafia Commission's investigation of the Municipality of Rome, the absence of any internal control, any audit or inspectorate carrying out preventive control within an institution which, with its participants, employs some 60,000 people, became clear. There are, however, even more general responsibilities than our country, that is, of us citizens. It is a poor country morally this, if it must reward those who only do their duty. This is a poor country, if it is to protect those who only do their duty. It is a poor country that needs, even in times of peace, heroes. Mr. President, I'm not returning. I believe in a country where there are still those who do not bow to the omerty, the arbitrariness and the personal convenience.

Mr President, following hearings, documentation and testimonies, the Commission is today presenting an act of direction in this House, in recognition of the considerable and difficult commitment of men and women who lend themselves to the resolution of a complex problem which is articulated in anti-violence centres and shelter homes. The safety and safety of women who are victims of violence and abuse is the cause of life of all law enforcement, protection services and of all volunteers who welcome, help, listen and protect victims of violence. To them goes the most heartfelt thanks. I extend my sincere and special thanks to the parish priests who, in silence, are often the first hope of salvation for many unfortunate women. Politics must play its part; in particular, the Commission of Inquiry must show preparation, responsibility and freedom from party preconceptions and logics. The Commission has drafted the resolution called for by the needs and demands, more or less concealed, of more than 350 anti-violence centres and more than 250 shelter homes. We are calling for clarity, starting with a certified number of such structures, and we are calling for them to comply with uniform structural requirements. In fact, not always are professional, accredited or specialized figures operating in them, as required by the Istanbul Convention. The Commission has been informed and has understood that mixed centres, whose aims are not only specific to the sphere of violence against women, cannot best represent the place for safety and physical and psychological safety. We need centres, shelters and specialized structures prepared for the complexity of the phenomenon of violence against women and the whole context that surrounds them, up to the knowledge of religious and cultural diversity. The resolution also highlights the problem of the distribution of available funds, not only limiting them through specialisation, but also and above all avoiding the doubt that some structures can become a boast and a political consequence, delegitimizing the intention and the remarkable nature of the same. This is unacceptable to the Commission. Categoric and homogeneous economic distribution criteria and mandatory structural and professional requirements for the various anti-violence centres are needed; the method is not recommended for knowledge, but rather for meritocracy in financing projects and structures. In addition, the State-Regions Conference resolved 30 million: 10 million for anti-violence centers, not only public but also private, and 10 million for shelter houses, not only public but also private. The funds, without any necessary programming, are from 2019 and the Commission claims that the associations themselves demand speed in the economic distribution. It is essential to have certainty in order to plan and effectively ensure the quality of the assistance and recovery service. The Covid-19 emergency period was evidence of this. Specialised professional figures are essential to tackle and manage the phenomenon of physical and moral violence. But, in addition to the courage and the great heart, for which there is no amount that will repay the commitment, they must be paid and recognized for the work done. Given that the only path for those who abuse women is a real and lasting penalty, there has been so much, even if never too much, in the regulatory field. In 2009, Italy already introduced the crime for acts of persecution; in 2013, there was the ratification of the Istanbul Convention; in 2019, the Code Red law. The associations also ask us for real and concrete help. The Grevio report states that normative is easier than policy action to combat, but this must begin already in families and schools and also go through media programs, with acts of awareness, control and condemnation of negative mitomanias. The rules, demands and problems multiply when, in anti-violence structures, in addition to the women victims there are also children. This, together with the deafening void on women and girls with disabilities who are victims of violence, must be the starting point for the next resolution. In the Italian legal order, in fact, there is still no specific legislation to protect them. So, there's a lot to do. Surely this resolution is the continuation of a series of battles against violence. Today the Government is asked to implement resources, to specialize and direct anti-violence centers and structures, to speed up and optimize the disbursements of money, to reward and recognize specific professional figures, to control the projects and to provide funds of the available fund. I would like to remind you, Minister, as we are under pressure, that there is still no signature on the President-in-Office's decree on the obligation to display the 1522 toll-free billboard in the premises. I think we can remedy this immediately. <p> As a committee of inquiry, we are in a great deal of readiness to participate effectively in these commitments and we call for the resolution to be accepted by everyone, but I would ask everyone not to stop here. <p> Mr President, allow me to close this speech by honouring and commemorating in this House, with immense sadness, Willy Monteiro Duarte, who died at the age of 21: for his mother, his little giant who wanted to be a cook; a golden boy, who loved, until he risked his life to defend a friend. We cling with heart and force to the suffering of family members.

I agreed to be rapporteur for this draft law because, of course, I shared the spirit and the theme that is being addressed and which is being tried and solved. As rapporteur, I am not in a position to carry out the political defence of the document which is, of course, the responsibility of the Government, but I believe that I have to make some comments about the fundamental aspects of the debate. <p> First of all, I would like to focus on the qualifying issue of the measure, namely the issue of the precariousness of the public administration and the companies involved. <p> I believe that if there is a realistic and non-prejudice approach, if there is a responsible approach one cannot deny that the problem of the precarious... (Brussio). Excuse me, I understand that the subject can be... president. Colleagues, I can understand that this is the start of the sitting, but I would ask Members to allow the rapporteur to reply. Please, Senator Pagliari, continue. Mr Pagliari, rapporteur. The problem of the precarious was not born by chance, it is not the result of fate, it is the result of political choices that cannot be denied, but that a responsible political class can only assume as a theme to be solved and overcome. This requires a process consisting of rules that lead to an exit from the current problem... (Brusio). Mr President, under these conditions, I shall give up my reply. <p> The issue of the precarious poses the problem of getting out of this situation taking into account the expectations that in any case the stay in service defined by the political and administrative choices has determined; moreover, this requires a process that governs in a clear and coherent way the topic of the term contracts and in any case the temporary performances and gives clear solutions that can and must be followed. <p> I think it should be made clear - as rapporteur for myself - that if we are a responsible Senate, the problem cannot be solved without providing a way out, a response to the expectations of the precarious public administration. <p> It is clear that this is not the case with the extensions, which have not seen a distinction of responsibility in successive governments, but for the first time with a procedure that poses the issue of overcoming the precariousness in a clear way: it is stated that precarious persons can access competitions exceeding which they can aspire to the place, which is also subject to the availability of the budget. In this situation - let it be clear - we do not make a \"pleasure\" to the precarious, but we give them a chance of exit, which is not stabilization. <p> I believe that on this level, except then to discuss the choices from the technical and legal point of view (in this regard there has been a very wide availability, which still remains), there can be absolute clarity. I do not know whether there is a sharing of this choice or not, but everyone must assume their responsibilities. I want to make this very clear because I, who have been in this Chamber for six months, have been completely sensitive to the precarious, not to rhetoric, but because at this moment the precarious is the victim of the situation and certainly not the responsible one; in my opinion, he cannot be transformed in any way into the responsible one. <p> This path does not give guarantees, it indicates a road that does not give certainties; we all know that it does not give certainties even regarding the topic of the acquisition of the place. The competition guarantees a selection that, if carried out seriously (as I think it will have to be done), will also guarantee the selection of staff. I believe that the process of intention based on the fact that it is known how it is going in Italy is a convenient way to escape from the political decision to take. <p> I believe that the same problem also arises with regard to the subject of the participating companies, which, from this point of view - I would like to point out - had in the course of its work in the first half of the year. Standing Commission a redefinition that limits its timing and limits its scope; the theme of the companies involved has been placed in the context of a reform plan of the whole system, starting again in this case a solution that passes through the industrial plan of the participating companies decided by the contracting authority and therefore by the public bodies, which in terms of principles can only be a guarantee. <p> Companies closely associated with public limited liability companies of true private law cannot be equated. This is something else: they are legally so and have been politically so. <p> I believe that this is the mistake of a system of participating companies which, especially at the level of local authorities, has been exaggerated. It was not a synergistic instrument for municipal administrations to carry out their tasks, but often an instrument through which the companies involved or outsourced decisions which, politically speaking, should have been taken at institutional level - they have been outsourced to escape institutional responsibilities - or have fed clientelism and given rise to recruitments often of a clientele nature. <p> Having said that, the policy that wants to overcome the problems does not erase the mistakes: it looks ahead and identifies solutions that can meet the demands of sure overcoming the systems, with the need to take into account the human destinies to which answers must be given, and not stabilization but paths that allow not to be found from today to tomorrow in an unsustainable situation. <p> We all know how the theme of participating companies interests all of Italy. We all know how it can affect the overall balance of so many municipal administrations. Then I believe that, from this point of view too, the solution found in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has already offered a limited way in time, correct in terms of investment, defined and contained. With respect to this, however, with all respect for the opinions of others, I do not think we can speak of absolute privilege. In this situation we are thinking in the perspective of an organic discipline that exceeds the current one of public societies and resizes the whole system. We are therefore faced with a rule that tries to \"pass the night\" and leave the system inveterate. It is a rule that arises in a process of overcoming that necessarily has two areas: on the one hand, reform and, on the other, the exit from the current system. However, we do not leave the current system by closing the door behind us. <p> Then there is the theme of the Territorial Cohesion Agency. I understand your sensitivity, but I believe that we must also do an act of intellectual honesty in this regard: we must tell ourselves whether we can afford to move forward by pretending that, in terms of the actual expenditure of European funds, we are up to Europe and we are efficient. We all know that we are at risk of losing these funds for a very simple reason: the public system, as it is structured today, is not able to decide within the necessary time. <p> So, I believe that a reflection must be made in this respect, if we are to be brutal and I apologise for it, which is very clear. The instrument to overcome this situation must be found in terms of urgency. This explains why the Agency for Territorial Cohesion is included in this measure. It must be found having attention to the efficiency of the system and not paying attention to the dynamics that always arise in the face of these situations for which those who have the competence and have not managed to exercise it adequately to the competence, do not want to give up and prefer the status quo compared to the overcoming of this situation. Compared to this, I personally say \"no\" by also making another reasoning. Those who know the complexity of public organisation issues know very well that public organisation or is properly structured at all levels of function necessary for public administration to produce its decisions or know that public administration does not reach decisions. Anyone who knows the administrative machine knows that, when it jams, it is necessary to identify what is the wheel that is missing, what is the model that must be exceeded, what is the best solution. Now, I believe that the Agency for Territorial Cohesion, when it sets itself - objectively, on the basis of the discipline, on this level - as an agency that offers an investigative competence, as an agency that promotes the proper conduct of the procedures to arrive at the expenditure, as a body that is concerned to contribute to that all the public system that must provide for the expenditure of public funding, is a choice to be made because it does not fit into the current state of the legislative plan as an unnecessary body, but as a necessary one to overcome the inefficiencies. Can it be the ultimate solution? I believe that everyone should be aware that organisational changes must all be tested, but I do not believe that in this framework, as outlined in the draft law, the Agency for Territorial Cohesion poses problems such as those highlighted in the debate and that it should be an Agency that needs to be suppressed rather than initiated so that it can contribute to the process that needs to be put in place. As far as European funding is concerned, no one wants to restrict the autonomy of local and regional authorities. We all know the Constitution, but at the moment we create a body that gives those professional skills that may not exist and that nevertheless gives that impetus by acting, in a broad sense, as responsible for the procedure in this area, I believe that we do a necessary operation that does not preclude refinements along the way, but that allows us to start today. With regard to the raised issue of the quality of legislation, I believe that from this point of view there is an absolute awareness and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has repeatedly addressed this issue also through a valuable contribution from Senator Palermo. Everyone is aware that there is an issue that concerns the way in which laws are drawn up, the way in which legislation can be ordained and coordinated, and that, if the legislature takes a breath, I believe it can be dealt with because it is one of the most important reforms. It is a reform that is about democracy itself, but it is also about legislation that, rather than producing delegification, really produces the effectiveness of the law. Now, this is a general theme, it is not a theme that can be placed with respect to the single provision. I am aware that there is an issue of quality in legislation, which has been dramatically aggravated in the 16th legislature; I am absolutely aware that it must be overcome. But the problem of the positive or negative approach to the decree or to its individual parts cannot be blocked by these situations. Then there are other problems that have emerged, in the field of teachers abroad and on other subjects and other subjects related to school. I believe that, from this point of view, it is clear that it is difficult to discuss these issues here; these issues, strictly speaking, would be subjects from another point of view and to be included in a specific decree-law on school. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. Senator Pagliari, you still have a minute to finish. Mr Pagliari, rapporteur. Thank you, Mr President. I believe that the solution that has been offered is a logical and immediate solution with regard to teachers abroad. I realize the many painful choices, which do not satisfy all the precarious. From this point of view, I have the greatest willingness to continue the comparison. I mean, among other things, that there is the whole issue of trainees that is not addressed at all; but we know very well what the limits of an operation like this are in these budgetary conditions.

Madam President, as you know, on the evening of 3 June Turin was hit by a serious incident linked to the Champions League final, which took place in Scotland. Parliamentary activities were firm at that time and there was therefore no opportunity to make a communication on this matter. It is known to all that, unfortunately, in recent days, Erika has died, one of the girls wounded. My speech wants to emphasize that, after those events, yesterday evening in Turin there was unfortunately a further tail linked to the events of San Carlo Square, albeit indirectly. After those events the mayor of Turin, in agreement with the prefect and the commissioner, has chosen to issue a series of stricter directives on the sale of alcohol and their consumption; norms that unfortunately were immediately challenged by some known sectors of the city, in particular by the social center Askatasuna, whose exponents in the last ten days have attacked on several occasions the Forces of the Order. And we arrived to record yesterday, in Piazza Santa Giulia, some clashes that also involved the adventurers present in the dehor. It is clear, Madam President, that this is a very serious matter for Turin, a city used for many years to host square parties, to have its entire parts dedicated to culture, music and meeting people. What happened in Piazza San Carlo is an incredible fact: 1,527 wounded. I do not think that, for a moment of leisure, such a situation has ever occurred. But here we are not looking for responsibilities that will have to be established. What is certain is that full protection of the Forces of Order is necessary. Yesterday, policemen were attacked and wounded by representatives of this social centre, sadly known. And I must say that I am concerned that there may be, in some political force, the idea that the fault of enforcing the rules, wanted by the mayor of Turin and that we support - as long as they are in force - may fall on the forces of order and not on the political hooliganism of the social center. I believe it is useful that this communication is also transmitted to the Minister of the Interior and it is necessary to bring solidarity to the Forces of Order. I then address an invitation to the Turin administration to continue along the path of legality, as it has been undertaken.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.752713143825531, 0.247286856174469]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> FUSCO (<PARTY>). Mr President, Minister, Senators, the Lega Group appreciates the motion tabled by its colleagues, which has put the importance of Rome as the capital of the country to the attention of this Assembly, with the aim of spreading and enhancing its role as capital, promoting the future development of the city, through a series of commemorative initiatives, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the proclamation to the capital of Italy. We believe that the recourse of the 150th anniversary from the proclamation of Rome Capital must, however, represent an opportunity to address more fully a topic of strategic importance, not only for the city of Rome, but for the whole country, with the hope that this discussion can represent a first but important part of the path that sees Parliament recognize in Rome a greater autonomy in the exercise of powers and functions, endowing the capital of Italy with the necessary resources, useful for better management of its archaeological, historical and architectural heritage. Just today that Rome is preparing to face the 150th anniversary from its proclamation as capital of the country, I believe that the recognition of a status that in terms of autonomy can really guarantee the objective of being able to preserve the value of eternal city, of open city, symbol of victory and liberation, which is recognized internationally. If we look at Rome with a look at the other European capitals, as rightly pointed out by the motion we are debating, we cannot fail to see how the major European and Western capitals enjoy specific funding for the performance of the functions related to their role in the state order, which is also indispensable to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of a historical and cultural heritage of enormous value that rarely belongs only to the local administrations, which therefore need interventions of their respective national states. We cannot talk about Rome without considering that its territory alone is larger than that of the other eight largest Italian cities combined and is equivalent to the sum of nine of the major European capitals: we are talking about Amsterdam, Bern, Athens, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin, Lisbon, Paris and Vienna. Although these figures highlight the greatness of Rome, one cannot help but point out that this does not correspond to an adequate regulatory recognition in terms of autonomy which is the responsibility of the main European capitals which, even with different specifications, enjoy forms of autonomy recognized by their respective systems. For example, in Germany and Austria, Berlin and Vienna are Länder; in Spain, Madrid is an autonomous community; in Belgium, Brussels has become the third region. Looking overseas, Washington is not only the capital of the US, but also a state. Rome is the only city in the world that hosts three circuits of embassies: as the capital of the Republic, as the seat of the Vatican City State and as the seat of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). At the same time, however, Rome is one of the few world capitals that still does not enjoy a particular autonomy. We share the concern expressed in this motion for a resolution about the dramatic economic emergency caused for the city of Rome by the outbreak of Covid-19, in particular with the paralysis of the tourism sector, which has always been the backbone of the city's economy, and for this reason it is necessary to have extraordinary support from the State towards the city. We believe that in addition to this extraordinary support, on the occasion of the anniversary of the 150th anniversary of its proclamation as capital, Rome also deserves a new consideration within the Italian order. I remember in fact that in addition to being our capital, as recognized by Article 114 of the Constitution, Rome was defined by Law No 42 of 2009 as a territorial entity Rome Capital. As a result, it has been recognised as having specific administrative functions on the subject of public and private construction, economic development, cultural heritage and civil protection. The first regulatory vulnus we believe should be surpassed as soon as possible is that the prerogatives recognized in Rome Capital insist only on the municipal territory and not on the area of the Metropolitan City, as established in law n. 56 of 2014. A solution to this incongruity would be to force the metropolitan area with the municipal one, constituting a central Rome to which the Lazio Region should inevitably give some competences. Through municipal decentralisation, it would also be a matter of recognizing to the individual municipalities, today in the metropolitan area, greater powers and greater autonomy, including financial autonomy, on their territories in the interests of the citizens and the services to be provided to them. Only in this way can we really recognize in Rome the role of capital of the country, while at the same time enhancing the individual municipalities that to date fall into the metropolitan area and that often struggle to enjoy the resources they would need because most of the times held centrally. These are the objectives that aim to be able to achieve our proposal for a law that contains provisions on the ordering of the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital that, recognizing to it its own autonomy, would undoubtedly also benefit the other capitals of the province of Lazio. We are talking about Viterbo, Rieti, Frosinone and Latina, which most of the time see regional resources taken from their territories, which are mostly phagocited by Rome, which should be allocated specific resources of the State. For this reason we will vote in favour of this motion with the hope that it will represent the first piece of a legislative path that finally sees Parliament discuss Rome and what is necessary so that what has been the capital of our country for 150 years, the seat of the main academies of art and culture, the center of Christendom of the world and the cradle of law, can see fully recognized its status as Italian capital.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5744397044181824, 0.42556032538414]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> LANGELLA (<PARTY>). Minister, the globalization of markets makes our producers compare with those of the world. It resists to the global challenge those who propose something extremely innovative or who produce, in the traditional manufacturing, with innovative processes and therefore at competitive costs. Reducing costs per unit of product in Italy is a difficult task because, however, the cost of labour remains high, because however the cost of energy is high (twice compared to that of the United States, which is also a country with great innovation). The problems of those who produce in Italy are multiplying in the Mezzogiorno, because of the chronic lack of infrastructure and networks. In the title of our question time there is one word missing, in my opinion: \"research\", which cannot be separated from \"innovation\" and from the subsequent development \"development.\" There are realities of excellence in our Mezzogiorno that should be supported by additional incentives for those who invest in research and industrial innovation. These include Campania\\'s technological district and Catania\\'s. From these districts start research that innovates life all over the world (microchips or polymeric materials, for example).

Madam President, Mr Azzollini's words have made it very clear that amendment 11.35 (text 3) is of extraordinary importance in order to give strength to that political option that was made with the so-called decree pays debts, with which the State clears its debts to companies: we have done it with 40 billion new issues of public debt, we have been in the parameters, the procedure is working, we will do the checks over time. In this case, there is action on current debt, not capital debt, and they are not an exificial part of the general government debt to enterprises. In the estimates of the Bank of Italy on the total amount of debt, which, on 15 September, however, must have been certified by all territorial and health authorities, there was talk of 90 billion euros of accumulated debt stocks towards companies. The 40 billion we've put in the field reduces this debt. It can be assumed that of the 90 billion debts of the public administration towards the companies - for the affirmation of the same Bank of Italy - 25 billion are functional debts, that is those that are normally between the order and the payment, and therefore have their rationality. There is therefore a spread of EUR 20-25 billion which probably concerns the current account; therefore, it is part of the liquidity that companies lack and that the State is late in paying. Since we could not make other manoeuvres similar to those of the decree pays debts, we have tried, with the meticulous and important commitment of the Budget Commission, to put in line a complex procedure (but difficult before, that is, in the approach, not after), which includes also the current debt, using a system of guaranteed agreements with various financial entities (the system of banks, cash deposits and loans and so on), which intervene when the Fund is set up to cover the charges, to guarantee the administrations that require the State to intervene in order to meet current debts. This is an operation which has been repositioned, as President Azzollini said, by Parliament. On the part of the Government, which I would therefore like to thank on behalf of my political group, there has been a great deal of willingness on this amendment, which has been reworded several times with the help of the Budget Committee and which now allows us, when the rule under consideration will apply, in the 60 days following the conversion to law of this decree, to look with greater expectation to the consolidation of the relationship between administration and enterprises, to approach that level of debt zeroing that is desirable in every civil and advanced country. This is one of the most complex and important measures of the whole measure we are examining. This concludes a commitment made by Parliament during these months, which began with the decree pays debts and the special commission for the examination of decree-laws, and which now finds its application calling into question other intermediaries and providing a mechanism for guaranteeing the state vis-à-vis other administrations through the Fund for the coverage of charges. That's a good result. I therefore strongly support this measure by thanking Senator Santini, who tabled Amendment No 11.35, for the tenacity with which he supported his commitment to achieving the objective set out in this amendment proposal. I would just like to add a note on the sidelines: Parliament will have to make a great deal of effort both on the issues that President Azzollini has reminded us, and on the monitoring of the procedure, to verify that this does not actually produce all the possible effects from the point of view of bureaucratic correspondence, but all the possible effects in order to actually get the money to companies. We started by unlocking 40 billion, the resources are coming to the administrations and in part coming to the companies, but at some point we will have to know - and I hope that by the year we can close this story - whether we have actually taken the decisive step to clear the debt between public administration and companies. For these reasons, we are strongly in favour of this amendment and we hope, together with President Azzollini, that Parliament will have stable control over the whole procedure and the bureaucratic interference that may occur on it.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6170691251754761, 0.3829308748245239]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is an important opportunity to present in this House all the work done by the Commission of Inquiry on the phenomenon of intimidation against local administrators. <p> First of all, it must be stressed that the parliamentary committee of inquiry into the phenomenon of intimidation against local administrators has done a good job and, for this reason, I must particularly thank the President of the Commission, in addition to the members of the Commission. The creation of this ad hoc Commission responds to a specific need to clarify the intimidating phenomenon, which is too long neglected by the political forums, but which at the same time weighs heavily on the territories. During our meetings, alarming data emerged: thousands of intimidating acts against local administrators are reported. Over 130 murders have occurred in the last forty years, not to mention all the cases in which local administrators resign from their role, but without making any complaints. In fact, there is talk of a dark figure, not quantifiable: it is assumed a much higher figure than the seventy cases so far attested to resignation by local administrators. What the final report highlights is that action must certainly be taken to combat or at least reduce the phenomenon by sharing and linking the various local institutions. Constant dialogue between police forces and institutional actors is needed in order to make surveillance and security much more effective. In this regard, one of the measures proposed is to create a multi-user database to draw on and share information on suspects. It has been realized, from the analysis of the data, that the problem is much more present in some Regions of South Italy, but also in the North Italy, and at the same time that the reasons behind the intimidation are not exclusively attributable to the phenomenon of organized crime, so much so that the activity of investigation has allowed us to identify many other causes. Among the most important, we have found that the phenomenon of intimidation is due to building abuse, the quarries sector, compulsory health care, welfare policies and welfare benefits. Therefore, considering all these critical profiles, we understand how the phenomenon is not homogeneous at all, but is multidimensional. This particular feature is the basis for any kind of strategy and law enforcement policy that is intended to be developed. Our hope is that this investigation, contained in the final report, will be a good starting point for preparing effective and appropriate measures to eradicate the phenomenon of intimidation and can be created a regulatory framework that, above all, guarantees the local administrator safety, which safeguards his safety and puts him in a position to fully exercise his functions. Politics is the greatest expression of human activity. Many are those who engage daily and passionately in political activities, starting from the administrative activities at the local level. I would also like to mention, in particular, the part of the Commission's report on local administration and the crisis in the relationship between citizens and institutions. I was very impressed, in the hearings held at the territorial level, by the statements of local administrators, both in the North, in the South and in Central Italy, who said quite clearly that in recent years there has been a decrease in the trust relationship between citizens and their administrators. I believe that this is the most politically interesting part of the work of the Commission of Inquiry, because it indicates that the relationship between institutions and citizens is failing. And this is also due to the fact that, between 2011 and 2012, local administrators had a reduction in capital expenditure by 18%, social sector expenditure by 4.5% and that more than half of the budgets are used for administrative and land management expenditure. Many people in this House have been the mayor and know that this figure becomes the first link between the citizen and the institutions. However, in recent years, the mayors, with the increase of their competences, accompanied by a drastic reduction of their resources, have repeatedly found themselves in a position to no longer respond as they would have wished to the demands of the citizens. In this regard I was struck by the statement of a mayor of the province of Verona who, speaking of the decrease of the trust relationship between administrator and citizen, said that he sees every day, in his daily life, the bad relationships that are recorded, specifying as follows: I see it every day when I receive the audience. Whether it's a question of a hedge or a light bulb, everything is an opportunity to argue. I think that's one of the reasons. I therefore appeal also to the political forces that in some cases, often and willingly, use the news of waste of resources and scandals (undoubtedly regrettable) to realize a form of delegitimization of the local administrators, and this must be absolutely avoided. As is the case with other professional activities, there is much news of scandals involving only one or two percent, and instead there is never news - and above all there is never any positive attitude, and this should be the prerogative of politics - of the thousands of administrators who, on the contrary, carry out their task regularly, and with great sacrifices. I therefore appeal to my fellow senators.

In the same way, one can understand how, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was thought of a majority law, which - as was said - favored the alternation of the government of a democratic right and left, as well as in the golden period of the decentralisation of state powers it was thought - and it was legitimate to do so - that the personalization of the figure of the mayor and then of the regional governor could bring the citizens closer to the politics of proximity. <p> Less clear is the process that led to the law Calderoli, recently cassata dalla Consulta. There he actually wanted to allow a leader, whose genius was able - and he was - to unite different forces, not only to have a large parliamentary majority, but also to be able to rely on a team that depended on him in everything: in short, a majority of nominations. It was a ruinous choice, which delegitimized Parliament and parliamentarians, who, from defenders of popular demands, ideas and demands, have become, in the imagination of many Italian citizens, consumers of public money and usurpers of the role of representative of the people. When we condemn anti-politics - and we often do so, starting with the President of the Republic - we should remember that we voted with Porcellum in 2006, 2008 and 2013: errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum. Now what? Now also thanks to a young and vigorous Premier, but not only, because the same path is taken in other countries, from Spain, to France, to Greece, the muscular bipolarism of the past twenty years is no longer a danger in our country. Today a political party would act as a pivot, at the center of the political field and other forces, all minor, would probably turn around. In addition, a constitutional revision law was passed at first reading, which aims to overcome bicameralism, and doing so objectively strengthens the government and shortens the process of law approval objectively. At the same time - we know - constitutional practice is characterized by an increasingly frequent use of decree-laws, delegated laws, trusted votes: we do not really see it because we still strengthen the powers of the Premier. On the other hand, Angela Merkel is the chancellor who governs Germany with a firm pulse, even if - as you know - the Bundestag is elected by proportional law. Of course we can object, as Senator Cociancich did just now, that the Italian system resembles a premiered in fact and not in law: we have not introduced systems such as constructive distrust - I say this - nor the French device that allows the Government to give for approval sensitive laws, unless the opposition asks and obtains to distrust the Government. Well, be allowed: despite the end of bipolarism and the birth - as Matthew Renzi says - of a party of the Nation, so strong was the trauma of the weak governments of the distant first Republic that we still want a majority law. But then I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, that it be a real majority law, such as the English law, in which only one is elected by the college and the defeated (even when their votes together were majority among the valid ones) count for nothing and have no right to anything (by this way the strongest party generally gets a large majority in Parliament and its Premier becomes the dominus of Downing Street), or a majority law in the French version that provides for the ballot if no candidate has obtained more than half of the votes in the college: it is a less severe majoritarian who tends to protect the second and sometimes the third political force of France, and allows alliances and desistences between first and second round. But what is being proposed to us now, ladies and gentlemen, this Italicum 2.0 is not, in my opinion - excuse me if I say so - neither in heaven nor on earth: it is a law that allows the candidate Premier voted by 40% of those who go to the polls to count on a large majority in Parliament, and if he does not exceed that quota would still give him that large majority after a ballot, that is after having prevailed over a challenger, thus giving to the investiture a force equal to that of direct universal suffrage. A very strong Premier, therefore, but a very weak Parliament. Members would, in fact, be elected in proportional terms, with the remains redistributed in the national college, with the possibility of multiple nominations, the capilist chosen directly by the Premier (or by mechanisms, the primary ones, entrusted to the good will of the party of belonging), and a hundred MPs, moreover, who arrive at the House only by virtue of the prize torn from the Premier. This is not a majority law. The combined arrangement provides for the plebiscytic election of a Premier and the lasting and institutionalized subordination of parliamentarians to the wishes of the winner or for part of the losing Premier candidates. Moreover, there are no barrier thresholds (they are very low), and if it makes sense to guarantee a right of stand for minor forces objectively it also promotes fragmentation. Is that what you want? Do you want a regime that revolves around one political force and one man, with fragmented and under-represented oppositions? Do you remember, ladies and gentlemen, that you have approved the reduction to 100 of the members of the Senate (which, moreover, were elected by a second grade vote) and that consequently who won the elections with Italicum in the House, by virtue of the majority prize, could appoint himself a President of the Republic and determine the majority of the Constitutional Court itself? The powers of the government and those of guarantee to a single leader, albeit young, unjudged and enlightened; a parliament instead delegitimized or, at best, shining only of reflected light. But what Western democracy - I ask you - has ever adopted such a law? If you have an example, let me know. I didn\\'t find any. Or do we want to imitate Russia and Turkey? Don\\'t do that, Senators. If the haste has now become the queen of the Italian political Olympus, if you want from this Senate a further act of obedience that is prodromic to the election of a President of the Republic chosen in a prudent at the top or object of a negotiation of power try at least to amend the Italicum; remove the multiple candidatures and the blocked capilists. Try to re-introduce the college, which is very different from a small constituency, being the ratio of the college to invest a representative of the people, that is, a woman or a man who responds directly to his voters, even to those who did not vote but knows him well: he chases him, talks to him, disputes him, if necessary, in the college. Try to change the Italicum and, please, don\\'t talk about a safeguard clause anymore.

From here comes our explanation of vote in favour of the proposal of Senator De Petris, which emanates from the delicacy of the subject. All the issues of this reform of the public administration are important: there is no doubt. Here, however, from our point of view, there is the story of an evolution of our municipal bureaucracy and on the territories, which in recent years has been traversed by profound reforms, great changes and changes that, within such a complex context, see the figure of the municipal secretary as that of a structure that, from our point of view, carrying out that function, has had a great importance and has been able to give important guarantees to our local administrations. Today, while we are moving towards a revision of the function and, therefore, the important role that they play, we believe that, not in this context, but in a separate context dedicated to them, this revision can develop better. That is why I also propose, for my part, that there may be a different assessment.

I hope it's the last year. <p> The government's institutionally incorrect lordship stifles the debate, prevents normal dialectic with Parliament and reduces its democratic connotations. I would like to thank my colleagues who have worked in the Budget Committee, at the limits of human bearability. I hope it doesn't happen again. The debate and debate here in this House would have been a desirable thing. <p> The nature of the government alliance is sloppy and uncertain. The budget law takes shape with an unprecedented delay. We are at the limits of democracy when, beyond the changing actors, one - the 5 Star Movement - remains boldly the same; we are at the limits of constitutional freedom because the principles on which our democracy is founded are affected. I believe that the frames from the struggle continue among you of the majority and from the arrivals of vetoes and vetoes show that it has actually lost its mother line in order to kick the budgetary difficulties and bring us back to a condition of normality. <p> The country is lost and feels unguided. Play with each other, believing that the removal of a tax, assumed on the political merit of a member of the Government, absolves you of total irresponsibility. You say you sterilized VAT, but with your attitude you are sterilizing Parliament and, above all, Italy as a whole. <p> As for the substance, I would like to remind you of some of the issues. Do you think that with little change can be solved the problem of the drama of school buildings that in 70 percent of cases - I repeat, 70 percent of cases - as has recently found a study of the Agnelli Foundation, pours into conditions of danger? Let's all think about what is happening these days: the earthquake zones, the seismic swarms also present in my land and everywhere in Italy. A scientist recently published a study that warns the whole of Italy because there could be The Big One, that is, a great earthquake could hit the whole country. We also think of our children and grandchildren in unsafe schools. These are the fundamental themes, and not the few change you gave here and there. <p> And what about the Mezzogiorno, which has also ended up in the shadows of this financial manoeuvre? The South is no longer a priority. And yet, you think it's important, because sometimes even President Conte says he'll talk about the South and do things in his favor. In the meantime, however, words remain only intentions. <p> The South is not your top priority. However, given the decline in the population and an unstable balance of decline, this budgetary manoeuvre should already have contained the ingredients for a revival of the Mezzogiorno. From 2015 to 2019 we have already lost 310,000 people, many of them young. Everyone called the young people, but let us also think of the fifty-fifties and fifty-five years of age who lose their jobs, of which no one ever talks and who are even more at risk than others. I hope, therefore, that you will give them attention. <p> Look - and I am addressing some of my colleagues who are in a moment of rebellion - I am not in the majority, but in the opposition, and there are so many amendments that I have tabled and which relate to a number of areas, but not one has been accepted. The most serious aspect is that they do not even come to this House, so that they can inform the people we are interested in on the outside: that is the serious thing. <p> Having said that, I believe that with the impoverishment of human capital the opportunities for growth in the South are zero. Immediately immediate policies are needed which the Government does not propose. The lack of work in the South arises mainly from a problem of industrial production, that is from the lack of a production of goods and services capable of overcoming the constraints of the local markets and competing globally. <p> Special attention should therefore be paid to avoiding depopulation. In this regard, I have tabled a draft law which is intended to encourage inland areas in order to avoid depopulation. I hope that this majority will take this into account and perhaps - why not - discuss it. This is what is lacking in your strategy: a development policy for the South that would be useful for the whole country. <p> Today the North is no longer the locomotive and its growth no longer drives the rest of the country. <p> I always listen to everyone with politeness and I hope you do the same. I've always been sitting here listening to everyone, because I think listening is fundamental, so don't bother talking. Mr President, I apologize, I should have asked you to silence some voices that you are disturbing. <p> North therefore no longer activates development in other inland areas. On the contrary, the development of the South, if the Government gave a sign of true attention, would spread in all the territories of the Country. This would be a necessary policy in terms of both efficiency and fairness. <p> And what about your idle dispute over the putting aside of the current motorway dealerships? As you argue, bridges fall, people are afraid, and this, as in Liguria, depresses the economy. And how depressing that economy is! The Ligurian coast, stormed by Lombards and Piedmontese, remains in these deserted hours, because people are afraid. That torn land would need incentives before dozens and dozens of activities close their doors. People won't even come for these parties, because bridges have fallen and because on the other side, on the provincial roads... <p> The government representative, instead of talking and being distracted, maybe he could give me some attention and take a few notes. Instead, I see you keep talking. Then when you're done... <p> I said that Liguria, in the same way as other parts of Italy (but to which attention has been paid), needs incentives, because at this moment that land is isolated, has no bridges and the provincial roads are disadvantaged, as already mentioned in this House, the Provinces have yes delegations, but not the funds to intervene. That land is really experiencing dramatic moments. <p> Now, for the big issues, from Ilva to the highways, not knowing what to do, you entrust yourself to the decisions of the judiciary - heard, heard - whose institutional task is far from that; even if relying on it, as demonstrated by the judgment on the blast furnace closed in Taranto, can cause dramatic problems for the Taranto workers, as it is happening. <p> Then let's talk about the elimination of the prescription. Without the reasonable duration of the trial, it will be life imprisonment for the innocent. I repeat, life sentence for the innocent. <p> What about the 160 disputes opened at MISE that demonstrate the inadequacy of the young former leader of the 5 Stars, perhaps also for this repaired to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? And what about the objections that the European Commission has expressed to you, highlighting the inadequacy of the manoeuvre in relation to the debt reduction parameters? Too many taxes, then, and with demagogic choices about tax evasion, which leave the time they find. Basically, a sum of ingredients put at random without a thread. This is because of the logic of Plato's winged horses, to which this coalition resembles: everyone looks at himself and no auriga is able to steal them by pointing the right way. The horses of this government, indeed the buzzards, are now out of control. It is difficult, in fact it is impossible to govern this way. Even the most knowledgeable of you are realizing it.

They\\'re Marò Basques. We have listened carefully to your communications in this House and, frankly, Mr Letta, you must explain to us what changes compared to yesterday and why we should now give you confidence. You\\'ve always talked about the same things. In today\\'s intervention, like in a Bignami, there is a summary of his previous interventions on reforms, economy and employment. Today it has also moved to anticipate an economic mini-resume that is coming. Who are you kidding? Yours is just an attempt to liven up to 2015, with the excuse of overcoming the European semester, hoping to weaken the opposition, and also its secretary Renzi, who is eager to send you home. His was to be a Government of broad understanding, it was to be the Government of the great constitutional reforms: so it was in other European countries. It was supposed to be the Government of change, but it was none of this: it became the Government at all costs, and you are ringing up a whole series of useless measures and measures with now weekly confidences. <p> On the inside, it\\'s a real disaster. The IMU operation proved to be a real failure; you mocked the virtuous Municipalities, those who did not increase the rates. You promised compensation with the Solidarity Fund. On the other hand, citizens will be forced to pay part of the second down payment; you have taxed offices, shops and production activities with increases of up to 500 percent. <p> Yours is an asset: let\\'s call it by its name, because this is the IMU on the productive buildings of the enterprise, and it is a real madness. You hit sheds that serve to produce income. The company\\'s income, Mr President, is already being burdened by IRES and IRAP. You led us to a real 63.8 percent tax, a world record. <p> To continue with your records, which I would define as absolute: unemployment records at 12.5 percent (there are six million, unemployed and unemployed); exodus records (there are 300,000, thanks to the Fornero law that you have not been able to cancel); youth unemployment records (42 percent); records of young Italian immigrants abroad (in 2012 there were 68,000) records in tax payments (over 100 percent: this is a contradiction in terms, Mr President; you had to call them not tax advances, but tax thefts) <p> ; record in the cost of bureaucracy (61 billion a year, and we do not say so at the League, but your Deputy Minister); record in bankruptcy (9,900 companies failed this year, 12 percent more than in 2012); record in the contraction of consumption; record in the decrease of VAT revenues (with a decrease of 3.5 billion); r ecord in public debt (134 percent on GDP, equal to 2,080 billion, second in Europe after Greece). Luckily, you, President Letta, talk about reducing public spending, with 800 billion spending reviews, sales, and even sale of public assets. After all, President Letta, you have a good teacher in President Prodi, who with gifts to the privates has also sold the IRI. <p> President, have the courage to cut gold pensions, to cut public funding altogether, have the courage to apply the standard costs that our governors of Veneto, Lombardy and Piedmont have incurred; and not only in health, but do so on the whole public administration, including the Ministries, where they do not even apply the Stability Pact. You\\'ll see that you don\\'t need any Cottarelli, or spending reviews, or cutting Provinces. <p> Follow our proposed constitutional reform adopted in 2005, which you rejected in the 2006 referendum. Remember, because on this you have the short memory, that in that reform there was already the cut of the parliamentarians and the Federal Senate of the Regions. He disappointed us very much today, when he declared the death of the Bicameral for reforms: that could be the only way to make them. Make serious proposals on the labour market, delete the Fornero law and open to flexibility. The problem is not the permanent employment contract (thanks to you in Italy only 17% of the contracts are), but you have to encourage the work/school alternation that has produced excellent results in Germany. And then enough, enough with the contributions to Rome Capital: another 200 million to repay the debts, in the face of the virtuous municipalities of the North! It is enough to refinance the socially useful workers of Palermo, Naples and Calabria. <p> And enough with the malicious ads: in 2013, until now, there are 42,000 landings; all this thanks to the good and harmful ads on the cancellation of the crime of illegal immigration and the ius solo. Enough amnesties, indults, and empty prisons! Minister Cancellieri: Prisoners do not need to learn to score or to box; they already know how to do it better than all of us. <p> We need certain rules, certain penalties, new prisons and greater security for citizens. On these issues we will do all kinds of battles, both inside and outside Parliament. <p> On the foreign side, another complete disaster: you bowed your head to the fiscal compact and the European constraints. You have allowed Commissioner Olli Rehn to go into the substance of the amendments to the Stability Act. In addition, while Germany reached the record of investment in research and development, for an amount equal to 3% of GDP, you, Mr President, are proud that you have not exceeded 3% of the deficit! This is the reality: they command and we just obey! President Letta, people do not want the euro, they do not want this euro, which has been imposed on us and has been a failure. People want a Europe of peoples, not of nations, a Europe of self-government, a Europe that defends our products and does not accept unfair competition from products such as \"Mozzabella\" (Mozzabella), \"Prosekko\" (Prosekko) and \"Lyophilisate\" (Norwegian) soluble wine. <p> The worst thing is that you have forgotten not only the poor, not only the businesses and all the Italians in the country, but also our soldiers, our maròs, abandoned in India to their destiny. It is useless for him to be angry with the League: there is no irony, on the contrary: today we have supported on our benches the symbol of those who are sacrificing themselves - the Basque of our Maròs - and we will vote with conviction the distrust of your Government: a Government that has brought Italy into the abyss.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5592490434646606, 0.44075092673301697]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking you to talk about the order of business. <p> MATTESINI (<PARTY>).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Government, we are in the process of converting yet another ILVA decree, the tenth, and once again with a request for confidence. This year's story concerns a company complex that, due to its size and the high number of employees, is the largest in our country and is certainly the one that has an environmental impact among the most significant. This new decree concerns the improvement of the previous one and aims at the solution of questions related to the cession of the business complexes, as laid down in February last. In other words, it is useful - and not only in my opinion - to make its acquisition more attractive by one of the two roped that are in the field. As regards the purchase and disposal of business complexes, I would like to remind you how the first transfer was managed to private individuals, that of 1995, when Dr. Emilio Riva was able to take over this property having provision for early retirement of older workers, on the one hand, and employment training contracts for the recruitment of young workers, on the other. It was a virtually zero-cost operation, even for the incentives made available. It does not appear to me that he was asked, on that occasion, for commitments or investments in plant safety, the production cycle and new technologies, nor for pollution. With that choice he was offered a license to pollute and poison a territory, with the risk of people becoming ill and, very often, dying. Someone spoke of a dramatic, tragic, regalia. After the era of Riva and the commissionership were many promises and commitments not kept to face and try to resolve a situation that has become increasingly tragic, for the factory, but especially for the city of Taranto and the surrounding territory. For every urgent decree approved on the ILVA we have been explained that they were extraordinary measures, able to arrive to the outcome of making the constitutional rights to health and work due also by the citizens of Taranto and the employees of the factory. We have done so ten times in four years (nearly eleven, because one was not a decree) until reaching the latter, which only favors the transfer to private individuals. The point is that nothing will change with the approval of this decree-law at our examination but, on the contrary, the measures that it contains will worsen the current situation, of citizens and workers. The factory has continued to cause serious damage to the population and the environment. With the 18-month delay of the implementation of the environmental and health protection plan approved by the Council of Ministers in March 2014, we expect a further extension of time for a plan that had already been fired late and had already intervened by moving forward the application of the requirements of the integrated environmental authorisation (IAA) of 2012 until August 2016. We remember when the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea declared that this would be the instrument to resolve the dramas of Taranto and that, soon after, the extraordinary commissioner would have prepared the industrial plan. What an industrial plan! The Commissioner had this task, but he failed to carry it out (it was not even a task that he had, as it was entrusted by the Government). No recovery has been done - zero - and the time and requirements of the AIA have only been further extended. As if all this were not enough, in the previous decree-law of February last, the terms were moved further forward (until June 2017) to arrive, to date, at a rule that allows those who submit a binding offer to request changes to the environmental plan and a postponement up to eighteen months of its final term. This appears as a bonus - a further, tragic bonus - in favour of those who are preparing to buy and yet another slap on the face to those who - above all, citizens - continue to suffer the consequences of the health emergency. But there's more. We are talking about the extension of the judicial shield already provided for commissioners also to future buyers and tenants and their delegates. This rule will allow them not to answer criminally, civilly and from an administrative point of view of the conduct they will put in place. In addition to everything I have already pointed out, there is also the lack of guarantee for the maintenance of employment levels. In fact, it was not considered to have to bind future buyers, by including the protection of employment levels within a specific rule of the decree-law. Only in this way would there have been a certainty for the workers. There are hard days for all workers, which are about 12,000. Last but not least, I recall the provision contained in Article 1 of the measure, aimed at placing the burden of reimbursement of the 400 million euros allocated by the previous decree-law on the commissioner's structure. It is, therefore, money that will be reimbursed by the commissioner's structure and, that is, put at the expense of the state's budget. Does this not also look like a concession too unbalanced in favor of future buyers? Are we not able, as a state, to place binding constraints on private buyers? The decree-law in question has nothing urgent and yet another confidence consolidates a strategy, which is now inseparable, which tends not to create discontinuities with an unsustainable past from an environmental and economic point of view. Let us have the courage to say that polluting industrialization in territories such as Taranto (but I could mention other industrial poles such as Ravenna, Gela or Augusta) has taken its time and that it is now necessary to aim for the conversion of companies that, as a top priority, must pursue total compatibility with the environment. It's more than a slippage of environmental plans! In a serious country this should be the priority of priorities. Afterwards, action must be taken with a view to the rehabilitation, reclamation and stopping - or at least reducing - the escalation of the cancer diseases that characterize those territories. It is pointless to shake the fear of job losses or the detriment of the national economy if that is the price to be paid. There are values and non-negotiable goods and the health of man and the environment is among them. It has been a long time, far too long, and we do not feel that we share further strategies of the delay, let alone if conducted under the werena of the question of trust.

The most appropriate comment came from the father of the boy who was driving the car: they will have my gratitude forever, without them and their intervention now we would have two funerals. By closing, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are used to hearing the kids belittle; we call them squeamish, squeamish, dollish, indifferent. A mild evening at the end of the summer, interrupted by a terrible bang, has instead highlighted the good guys, those we do not expect and who do not have the honor of the news. These good boys are darkened by clichés, too many clichés. These guys risked their lives to save the lives of two guys like them. They've done what each of us should do, and too many times it's not done. The parents, our community and my parliamentary group are grateful to you for the courage you have put at the disposal of two young people like you, and this is heartening to all: a gesture of absolute altruism that comforts everyone in the face of so much selfishness and indifference that distinguish today's society. Gestures like yours infuse a new hope for a better society. Thank you Jacopo, thank you Nicola and good wishes to the two boys, in the hope that they will heal soon.

Mr President, unfortunately, the figures in this report presented by the Government are uncomfortable. That ended so, honestly we of the North League had already said in the explanation of vote to the so-called decree save Italy, that everyone applauded except us. We knew it ended like this: but why? In one year, the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen from 120 to 134%, with 14 worsening points. To give an idea, colleagues, the governments of cheerful spending - Craxi and Forlani, to say the least - had increased this ratio by four points in a year: here, instead, in a year we managed to do three times worse than those governments. Why? However, we have already said this: there is a banal rule, which knows everyone who deals in the least with public finance, namely that every 15 billion euros of additional taxes, GDP falls by at least one point, if not more. We put in an avalanche of taxes and unfortunately this is exactly what happened. Let me give you an example in a thousand, about boats, which, as you know, by definition move. When a very strong taxation was introduced on the boats, we said: \"Look that there is a problem.\" There the government was planning to collect 200 million euros, but in fact it only cashed 20, because the boats moved and 200 million were spent. In addition, we have lost EUR 1 billion for the pipeline, because we have lost important orders: so, in order to collect EUR 20 million, we have lost 1,180. It is an example, which serves just to make clear the mistakes that have been made and which have led to this situation. The same thing happened for the car and the IMU on the house, and we all know how the real estate business works. Well, in addition to that, there is another phenomenon that we had challenged. Last year we gave 46 billion euros (so 46,000 million, a huge amount) to the banks of half Europe and four billion euros to the Monte dei Paschi di Siena, for a total of 50 billion euros. Clearly, these too have had a lot of impact on that relationship. Since we can give 50 billion euros to the banks of half of Europe, holy peace, it is right that we finally give 40 billion euros to our businesses. <p> Unfortunately we give them in two years, and we hope that they will really get to the companies (but this we will deepen). <p> So let\\'s talk about payments. Already today, making another example, the Lombardy Region pays to 30 days, so it would not need the decree-law; it pays to 60 days the sanitary debts, but our goal is to carry in a couple of years also those to the payment to 30 days. So, no problem for the Region, but the Municipalities of the North, of Lombardy but not only, the Municipalities of a little \\'all the country that have the money in cash cannot pay, not because of them, but because there is a stupid rule: there is the Stability Pact that prevents it. Now, if a rule is wrong, let\\'s change it, there are no more excuses; this is the good time and therefore this rule must be changed. Moreover, having already provided for the compulsory balance of the budget also for the municipalities and local authorities with the reform of the accounting rules, at this point it makes no sense to impose further constraints such as the Stability Pact. We shall therefore see the text of the decree-law and hope that these problems will finally be resolved in it. What matters most, though, is that liquidity really comes to business. Colleagues, imagine a beautiful field with many channels that irrigate everything. Not those concrete canals where the water flows and reaches the bottom: earth canals, made in the earth, in which unfortunately, when the earth is dry because the drought lasts for a couple of years, even if you put water in the canal, the ground drinks it all and does not reach the bottom of the field. Here we are in the same situation: the risk is that, paid for the first company, it does not pay suppliers, limiting itself to improving its banking situation and trusts. So we would have solved little, really very little. Therefore, we in the North League will do everything and deepen the text because we want water to reach the bottom of the camp. We want liquidity to reach small and medium-sized municipalities and not just large and large indebted regions; we want it to reach everywhere in the public administration, but above all small and medium-sized enterprises, the real economy. This will be the effort that the North League - and I hope the whole Senate - will make in dealing with this important decree-law.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.703242301940918, 0.2967577576637268]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> Hundreds of thousands (<PARTY>). Mr President, the combined provisions of Articles 29 (which, I recall, provide that the family is a natural society based on marriage), 30 and 31 of the Constitution unequivocally state the preferential regime of the family as a fundamental nucleus of society. According to the latest ISTAT report, which spread the demographic indices, births in Italy continue to decline: in 2015 there were 488,000. The average number of children per woman is 1.35 in 2015 and this trend is confirmed. Parents\\' ability to invest in the future of their children depends on many factors, including their occupational status, health, the level of education achieved and support in the care tasks that the community offers them. The possibility of having skills and resources, not only economic, is essential, especially in the first years of the child\\'s life, when the educational and relational offer is decisive in order to bring out the potential. Denatality in Europe is now an emergency. By 2025, the first European countries - Italy, Spain, Germany and Greece - could experience demographic implosion, i.e. the actual decrease in the population. This will not be resolved by the law you passed yesterday. It is necessary to deal systematically with the first and most important need, represented by having a family, that is to say, to exist. The main objective must be to encourage the birth through a series of instruments that intervene in the most delicate age group of the child, i.e. until the third year of age. This age group is sensitive in terms of education and the demand for attention and care, as well as because of the greater difficulty of reconciling family and working needs. It is necessary to give full implementation to Article 31 of the Constitution, which states that \"The Republic shall facilitate with economic measures and other provisions the formation of the family and the performance of the related tasks (...)\" At this point, we would like to know what policies the government intends to adopt to support the family economically and to combat the scourge of birth.

My amendment tends to ensure that this Commissioner is appointed and also indicates the way in which this should be done.

Twenty-one have arrived at the first phase of the first selection for Capitals of Culture and today, six remain in the short lists, for what is the prodromic activity at the final designation. Well, I believe that the effort made by these municipalities at such a difficult time should be rewarded, and that it cannot be done only by the designation of a single city, which will then become the European Capital of Culture in 2019. The rationale and underlying philosophy of the motion must be shared regardless, leaving aside our settings and our positionings in this House. We must do this because the municipalities, in planning and implementing that bank projects mentioned in the motion, have made a real revolution, also from the point of view of administrative culture. It is thought that until a few years ago, even in recent times, the goodness and skill of an administration were evaluated by the ability to realize public works. A budget was read only for what was the programming of public works, often untied, disorganic and uneven, which did not look too far and did not show a far-sighted look on the part of the administrators. Well, if we reward, as we do with this motion (and as the Government must then do downstream of the approval of this motion), the ability to plan regardless of the conveniences of the moment, what can be the small clientele occasions that can connote positively, for a few days or for a few weeks, the administrative action of a mayor or a councilman, we have done a good political action. I had the opportunity to follow more directly the path of a particular city, the city of Lecce. Well, at a time when it is difficult to have references outside the municipality (because we do not understand, in this great constitutional engineering that we are all trying to put into practice, which are the intermediate bodies), I have seen the city capital of my territory become a pivot and become what we often, in words, define a vast area, without knowing what it is. The action of Lecce Capital of culture has become the vast area for a territory that is not only the provincial one, but that of a much wider area. Well, the final part of the motion, where it is said that we have to go beyond the contingency of the designation of a single city as Capital of Culture, going to reward the effort of all the cities, becomes the element that distinguishes not only the motion, but our ability to be behind these municipalities and to realize a good practice, that applies not only to these 21 cities, but that then becomes model to realize in this matter, not only of cultural programming, but certainly in the first place of cultural programming, a scheme to follow and to be defined as a usual scheme that exalts the programming ability of local administrators and enhances a cultural programming. For these reasons, Madam President, I have given my firm support to motion 182.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.8807945251464844, 0.11920548230409622]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time is too late, but I would like to use the time available to me to dwell on two fundamental points before we go into the substance of the measure. <p> Firstly, I would like to reiterate the full solidarity and support of the Forza Italia Group - and I think I can speak on behalf of all the Italian people - to the Ukrainian people and to stress that Italy, together with all the Allied countries, is seeking a diplomatic solution, which remains the main way to resolve this crisis. At the same time, I would like to say that it is our right and our duty to help those victims who cannot defend themselves against aggression, and in this case too, Italy, in my opinion, is playing its part. <p> The second aspect is the economic repercussions that this war, which has lasted for over two months, has on our economy. In Italy, increases in oil, gas and coal are increasing the costs of companies and this impact results in an increase in the Italian energy bill of 5.7 billion on a monthly basis, i.e. a higher burden of 68 billion on an annual basis. So far, companies have largely absorbed these cost increases in their margins, in some cases until they cancel them, instead of downloading them, as they should, on the subsequent stages of production. Erosive margins explain why inflation in Italy is still low. The only positive aspect is that this trend in prices and margins has safeguarded the competitiveness of Italian companies compared to those of other countries, but in my opinion this process is not sustainable for a long time. For this reason several companies are unfortunately reducing or stopping production or planning to do so in the coming months. <p> On the other hand, the rise in energy prices squeezes the purchasing power of households and this will affect the extent and rate of growth of consumption, the recovery of which was first hampered by the increase in contagions and now also by the increased uncertainty that influences confidence, which, as we have all seen, collapsed in March. <p> Another impact of the war comes from sanctions or counter-sanctions: the direct impact of sanctions to Russia on Italian exports is modest overall; the blockade concerns 686 million euros of sales to Russia, equal to 8.9% of Italian exports to the country, which in turn represents 1.5% of the total Italian exports. What worries, however, is that there are some specific Italian products, for example some machines, for which the weight of the Russian market exceeds 10%; therefore, if the total impact of the Italian non-export to Russia is sustainable, it is not so for those Italian companies that have in the Russian market the main, if not exclusive, recipient of their products or services. GDP growth in 2022 is much less favourable than previously estimated: this year there would be an increase of 1.9 per cent, with a large downward revision of about 2.2%, compared to the scenario outlined last October, when all forecasters agreed on 4%. At the same time, it is worrying about the rise in interest rates, as it will gradually increase interest expenditure, so there will be less budgetary space to put in place expansionary manoeuvres. There is therefore a risk of going back to prudent policies to avoid increases in spread, which is already very uphill. In the decree-law under consideration, the Government has put in place many important measures, which I would like to mention, because they have already been widely described by both the rapporteurs and our fellow senators. Allow me, however, to reflect on the bonuses, also given the last aid decree-law to be issued. In my view, perhaps you would need a reorder of all these bonuses. Only for 2022 we even have over 40, from the ATM bonus to the bus bonus, just to give two examples. These are buffer measures, while at the moment we need an overall vision and, above all, structural interventions for the relaunch of our country. In the Commission - and here I thank the Presidents of Mr D'Alfonso and Mr Girotto, the rapporteurs, Mr Tiraboschi and Mr Fenu, as well as all the Members of the Commission - we have tried to do a fruitful work of deepening and synthesis in order to find solutions to at least some of the issues we consider important, precisely in order to try to give a vision that goes beyond the immediate emergency. Let me now go into some of the amendments that have been adopted, including, first of all, the one relating to a very important issue, such as 5G technology-based communication services. We have intervened in this case with corrective measures, in my view very significant. The decree in its initial wording - I would like to remind you - provided for the obligation to send a notification including the annual schedule of purchases, but this seems incompatible with the possibility of the enterprises to supply immediately detailed technical information. We have therefore considered it necessary to remove from the article the reference to the degree of detail of the information transmitted and to clarify, with a view to simplifying, the exclusion from the notification requirement of acquisitions involving the mere extension of goods or services relating to contracts already in existence notified in accordance with the old procedure or in any case already approved. For the same reason, the forecast of updating the annual plan on a quarterly basis, contained in the original text of the decree, represented an excessive stiffening. We have therefore wanted to ensure that operators continue without uncertainty in the usual activities related to the development of 5G networks and in this respect, precisely in order not to impose the activity of these enterprises, we have eliminated the reference to the update on a four-monthly basis, providing that this happens during the year without time windows. Forza Italia also intervened to save the works eligible to benefit from tax relief in the field of construction, such as ecobonus, earthquakebonus or bonus facades. With an amendment, to my first signature, we have introduced the obligation for companies carrying out works of more than 516,000 to possess the qualification requirement of companies certification bodies (SOA), similar to that already provided for today for all seismic reconstruction works. Let me make this amendment clear. Ensuring regularity and quality standards does not mean further implementing bureaucracy for these companies, but giving quality and, above all, safety at work. In this way it will be possible to distinguish the serious companies from the improvised ones, that maybe - I want to remember it, because it has happened in recent months - have changed the Ateco code at the last moment for mere opportunism, transforming companies decotted into false construction companies, producing very high profits. Moreover, in order to safeguard small and diligent companies we have inserted a time period, until 31 December 2022, in which there will be no change of the norm, while from 1 January to 30 June 2023 the demand for the certification application will suffice. Only from 1 July will the rule be set. Another improvement meets a demand very much felt by the productive world and I want to thank in a special way the undersecretary Freni and the undersecretary War, with which we worked hard, for having accepted our request. In June, I would like to remind you, thousands of companies would have to pay the capital installments of the loans with State guarantee under the so-called Italian decree cure. We were able to extend the time span by a further six months to start paying. Then the measure will bring the payment of the instalments from twenty-four to thirty-six months.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5032735466957092, 0.49672648310661316]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> FREGOLENT (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Government, first of all we should also like to thank Senator Binetti and all the members of the Health Commission for the unitary agenda we are preparing to vote on. The themes have been extensively illustrated in the various interventions that have followed and I would like to focus on paediatric tumors sharing a reflection that starts from the love of a parent for his child, an unconditional love, which cannot be explained, but can only be lived. You know him when you're lucky enough to see that baby in your arms for the first time and stays forever. That is why it is said that there is no more painful thing for a parent than to lose a child. Here is the anomaly: the increase of cancers in paediatric and adolescent age. The Italian association registers tumors estimates that in the five years 2016-2020 in Italy 7,000 cancers have been diagnosed among children and 4,000 among adolescents between the fifteen and nineteen years, in line with the previous five years. When you meet one of those parents who have transformed such pain into the mission of a life, to help other young lives, the question that comes spontaneously is: what are the priorities of this country? How important is our daily running in the face of the suffering of certain people? But most importantly, are we doing everything we can on health and research issues? We, as a group, believe not. We are convinced that more and better could be done, if we were all honest in recognising priorities and working with strict rules to marginalize inappropriateness, because every mismanaged resource is a failure to respond to one of our fellow citizens. <p> Some of the things we ask for are so basic that it surprises us to have to repeat them. In particular, I am referring to the correct and uniform treatment of the paediatric oncology patient, promoting at territorial level the multidisciplinary approach and teamwork, with the presence of several specialists and with the aim of ensuring and improving the psychophysical well-being of the patient and his family. A survey conducted in Italy by the Soleterre ONLUS Foundation and the Trauma Research Unit of the Catholic University of Milan, from November 2019 to September 2021, on adolescents between the ages of twelve and twenty-three years, at the pediatric oncoematology unit of the Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia, showed clinically significant anxiety and depression. How could it be otherwise? It is already difficult when such oncologic diseases affect as adults; let us imagine when one is in the prime of the years. The psychological assistance of paediatric patients and their families in the medical oncology departments, carried out by qualified graduates in psychology, is crucial. It is necessary and fundamental, however, that our country, through the action of the Government, undertakes to support scientific research. The rare disease law is a first step, but we need to do more for the development of new therapies: allocate funds for innovative paediatric cancer drugs; activate experimental treatment protocols and develop clinical trials through a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. In addition, it is necessary to provide for the allocation of funds for the economic support of low-income households, taking into account the costs to be incurred in the case of admissions to care centres away from their residence. This last aspect inevitably leads us to the issue of fairness in access to care: no one should have a greater or lesser chance of curing himself on the basis of where he is born. Parliament therefore has the task of identifying certain rules of accountability and proper use of resources to ensure that all regions offer efficient responses to their fellow citizens, without lowering the bar of effectiveness of responses and claiming that the whole chain, from the executive summit to the... <p> I shall conclude, Mr President. It must be demanded that the whole chain, from the executive summit to the individual socio-health worker (OSS), works in all regions towards a single objective, that of guaranteeing the health of each of us. <p> For all these reasons, I announce the vote in favour of the Lega-Salvini Group Premier-Partito Sardo d'Azione on this agenda.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6214843988418579, 0.3785155415534973]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Mr Gualdani (AP-<PARTY>-UDC) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decree-law that we are about to convert is an important measure for local authorities, especially at this time when they are more burdened than ever by urgent financial problems that risk compromising the balance of their budgets and, above all, the provision of services to citizens. All the interventions in the text of the Decree-Law are marked by giving more breath to local authorities and removing them from the grip of the strict constraints linked to the compliance with the Internal Stability Pact. The decree-law intervenes on all territorial levels that make up the republican structure. With regard to the municipalities, the understanding of the state, the city and the local autonomy is transposed and additional financial spaces are granted for certain types of investment considered no longer extendable, such as the reclamation of asbestos in schools. The penalties for municipalities which failed to comply with the Internal Stability Pact in 2014 were re-determined in decrease, i.e. the reduction of the experimental rebalancing fund or the equalisation fund to the extent of the difference between the result recorded and the predetermined policy objective. The new sanction applies to the extent of 20% of the difference between the 2014 target balance and the financial balance achieved in the same year. This is a reduction in sanctions for non-compliance with the Stability Pact, but it does not mean that the sanctions themselves will fail completely, in order to protect the principle of congency of the Pact. For the year 2015, in order to deal with the damage caused by the air trumpet that affected the municipalities of Dolo, Pianiga and Mira in Veneto on 8 July 2015, the objective of the Internal Stability Pact for each of these municipalities was reduced for amounts necessary to ensure a rapid reconstruction of the infrastructure and the commercial activities affected. The problem of local taxation has remained open and unresolved, which will hopefully be dealt with under the next Stability Act, which will have to introduce a single local tax for simplifying citizens' tax obligations. On the other hand, this measure gave only a partial answer on the subject of agricultural IMU, the payment of which was deferred to 30 October without sanctions. On the provinces and metropolitan cities the decree-law was greatly improved by the Senate, which took on a very critical situation that would have caused the default of most institutions. The reform of the Rio, in fact, has not yet found full attention on the part of the Regions that have not yet provided for the enactment of the regional laws for the redistribution of the functions. Therefore, all the functions, not only the fundamental ones, have remained at the head of the Provinces that have suffered heavy cuts with the law of stability. <p> (17.43) (Gualdani followed). The work in the Senate has tried to remedy these problems by providing exceptional norms for the year 2015 and by putting in default the Regions that do not approve promptly the regional laws to reorder. For example, the Provinces and Metropolitan Cities that have failed to comply with the 2014 Stability Pact have been allowed to conclude new fixed-term contracts for the current year, with a deadline of 31 December 2015, provided that the current balance is guaranteed during the period concerned. With this corrective, large-area entities can renew precarious contracts, whose blockade had caused many protests during 2014. In addition, the issues relating to two categories of employees in the Provinces and Metropolitan Cities have been resolved: those of the provincial police and employment centres. In the general process of reorganization of the employees of the Provinces in the process of abolition, it is expected that the personnel of the Provinces who are commanded or seconded at the date of 31 December 2014 to other public administration will be transferred to it, without prejudice to the guarantee of financial sustainability under the expenditure regime. With regard to the matter of the relocation of the provincial police, it is expected that the authorities of the vast area and the metropolitan cities will identify the provincial police personnel necessary for the exercise of their fundamental functions, within a reassignment of functions of administrative police arranged by regional laws. Should there be any unidentified or unallocated provincial police personnel at 31 October 2015, the transfer to the municipalities, individuals and associates, shall take place. On employment services, an agreement has been concluded between the Government, the Regions and the Autonomous Provinces, concerning a plan to strengthen the Autonomous Provinces, for the purpose of the delivery of active policies, through the coordinated use of national and regional funds, as well as the resources of operational programmes co-financed by European funds. Provinces and metropolitan cities may conclude fixed-term employment contracts for the purposes of the operation of employment centres, with a maturity not later than 31 December 2016, even in the event of non-compliance with the Internal Stability Pact for 2014. We also remember the funding for the Sicilian Region to cope with the decrease in IRPEF revenues. We also remember that the measure also provides other important responses to the territories affected by the serious disasters of recent years, from the earthquake of Abruzzo in 2009, to the earthquake of Lombardy and Emilia Romagna in 2012, to the flood of Sardinia in 2013, with the aim of making transparent and fast reconstructions also through the establishment of free urban areas to which to devote important resources for investment. In this regard, the People's Area shares the need no longer extendable to intervene with a framework regulation on calamitous events that allows to establish equal measures for all territories that automatically trigger at the occurrence of certain conditions. Also important are the additional resources allocated for the backward payments of regions and local authorities to companies as well as all the measures envisaged for the launch of the electronic identity card. Let us also remember that during its work the Commission has tried to ensure the best solution to the long-standing question of the operation of tax agencies, providing for the possibility of issuing public competitions for the coverage of organic holidays of managers. In order to ensure the needs of current operational functionality, it has provided for the possibility to delegate, following a selective procedure with objective and transparent criteria, to third-area officials with professional experience of at least five years in the area, the functions relating to the offices of which they have taken over the interim management and related powers for the adoption of acts for a period not exceeding 31 December 2016. Finally, in the area of security, the use of military personnel belonging to the Armed Forces is extended until 31 December 2015 for the purpose of monitoring sensitive sites and targets, in the framework of safe roads operations and the Tierra dei Fuochi (Terra dei Fuochi) operations. In view above all of the extraordinary needs related to the Jubilee, the extraordinary recruitment of 1,050 units in the State Police, of 1,050 units in the Carabinieri Arm, of 400 units in the Finance Guard, for each of the years 2015 and 2016. The measure, Madam President, is full of content and ideas that constitute a good starting point for the recovery of territorial authorities; we are aware that the speech does not end here and that further measures will have to be taken in the next financial manoeuvre.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that the Government and Parliament have dealt with the ILVA issue. Let's hope it's the good time, the final time. We hope that with the rapid approval of the measure it will be possible to effectively pursue the objective of keeping together the productive activity of the largest European steel industry with a production capacity of 8 million tonnes per year of steel, a third therefore of the national requirements, with the employment continuity of a group that, between direct and indirect, employs altogether more than 16,000 workers, without reducing the environmental rehabilitation of the plant and the city of Taranto. I believe that the work carried out by both Commissions today allows us to approve a measure undoubtedly strengthened compared to the initial text of the decree-law, thanks to a fruitful work carried out, precisely, by the Industry and Environment Commissions and by all the parliamentary groups that have contributed to make this measure more effective and also thanks to the positive contribution of a number of audit subjects, social forces, institutional subjects, local institutions, extraordinary commissioners of the Ilva for the reclamation of the city of Taranto and the magistrates themselves of Milan and Taranto. We were faced with a very difficult and complex measure because the ILVA argument, in fact, must respond to, or should respond to, a number of requirements that are not static, at least in our vision, but absolutely dynamic: the need to protect the right of workers to work, the need to protect the right to the enterprise, the need to protect the right to health of citizens, as well as of course workers, and the right to the protection of the environment. These rights are constitutionally guaranteed and being able to find, in such a difficult situation, the point of fall, the point of balance obviously requires a series of mediations, a series of checks not always easy. Let us also bear in mind that the legislative measure, although dense, full of content and although providing for a whole series of absolutely certain and quantifiable commitments and resources, obviously also takes into account the resources available. I realize that we could have done more and better, but we could have done more and better with other resources. Clearly, parliamentary activity must take account of the reality of facts and things. I would add a very important remark: yesterday, during the debate that preceded the general debate, that is, at the time of the so-called constitutional prejudices, the Opposition Groups focused their intervention mainly on a fundamental issue, that is, on the healings that must be assured, and that this decree assures, to the Commissioners not only in the management of the plant but also in the management of the Bonifications. Long live God we realize that the problem must be addressed not with a purely theoretical attitude, but absolutely with the practical sense that should guide and determine common sense not only in common life but especially in political life and in parliamentary activity. This is a very difficult, complex situation, which is in fact outside the law, as do dozens and dozens of investigations that have affected not only the ILVA but also several prosecutors of the Republic throughout the national territory. A question which, of course, poses serious difficulties for those who have to take decisions and for those who have to take the lead in the direction booth. Clearly, this issue cannot be dealt with in an ordinary way. It is clear that some guarantees had to be guaranteed, and that is the meaning of the measure. We fully agree with the rationale of this legislative initiative precisely because we realize that it represents the precondition of a management, of a governance of the society that can at least free the pilots and directors from the daily concern of having to break the law daily. Obviously all this cannot be guaranteed forever: the moment will come when this extraordinary phase will be part of the management order and then that will be a whole other game. These are the reasons why I call on all my colleagues, even in full and absolute respect for the differences of opinion and the diversity of political positions, not to send misleading messages that outside this House can give a different idea of things, giving rise to emotions or impressions that are not true.

As my colleague Mr Zaffini said earlier, it is certainly not our intention to put flags on who did or did not do certain battles before; we are not interested. <p> We are certainly faced with a very dangerous situation which concerns the so-called phase 2. We have seen what happened in phase 1 and the situation before it. This should put us in a position to learn what happened and possibly act accordingly. <p> In our motion we have indicated how to deal with the so-called phase 2 and the dangers of a return of the virus to our territory; it is the mother of all battles, dear Deputy Minister and honourable senators. We could start any kind of discussion on the economic revival of our nation - and we are also in the front row with so many proposals on this - but if the virus and the health emergency come back, problems will arise for the whole of our nation. It is a problem that we will hardly be able to solve with interventions of an economic nature because of the fear created among our fellow citizens, as we are seeing in these days of first reopening of the various activities in our cities even of art still empty. Not only foreign tourists, but also many Italians have difficulty moving from Region to Region for fear of the virus. And this is the reality of the facts. Therefore, it is important for the state to intervene strongly on the issues of virus prevention, since we do not have the possibility of still having a vaccine and not even a certain cure. Although the motions present sound initiatives by scientific personnel on interventions and ways to improve the treatment of the virus, we certainly have nothing in our hands yet. <p> The prevention phase is therefore crucial. <p> The World Health Organization tells us to test, process and trace, and these cannot be empty slogans. We cannot find ourselves in an emergency condition such as the so-called first phase (the phase of closures) without knowing where to go and what to do; now we have a clear picture of what to do. Dear Deputy Minister, we must also take as an example what positive has been done in other nations. I am not convinced that Italy has acted worse than many other states, but I am convinced that some other state has acted better than Italy in the emerging phase, and I am taking the example of Germany. If we do not implement in the coming months what has been done in that country, it becomes difficult to block a possible return of the virus. I am talking first of all about the need to strengthen medicine on the ground, that is, the basic doctors and those who are at the forefront and at the border in fighting the enemy. And then it is necessary to strengthen screening interventions, and that is the object of our motion, and also of others. We cannot stop, dear representatives of the Government, Mr President, at a commercial intervention of 150,000 people in Italy; it becomes too little. In Germany, heavy screening was carried out on the population via swabs and serological initiative. The other aspect of which my colleague, Mr Zaffini, spoke before is not of secondary importance, because screening is one thing, while diagnostic intervention is subsequent to it. Citizens who want it must also be able to use rapid tests to be found in pharmacies, in order to certify the first phase, followed by the diagnostic phase. All these means - in my opinion - can guarantee something important and also provide greater security for citizens. Regarding the Immuni app, dear representatives of the Government, you have been telling us for days and days whether the app is worth or not; but, if people do not download it, it becomes useless. In Germany, not this path has been followed, but that of strengthening the basic medicine in the territory, making sure to trace all the positive results (i.e. the virus tracking and a task force of 20,000 people was created to carry out the checks. We have seen now that the numbers are very low; when there are one, two or five cases of new infections, we could control all the people who have attended those subjects. Of course, there are also asymptomatic people, and that is why our requests to increase screening and then diagnostics are important, which must go hand in hand. On the other hand, it is not a battle that we have started to fight just now. Already in the course of the examination of the decree cure Italy we had tabled an amendment in this direction, in which there was also a financing that we then turned into an agenda, accepted by the Government, which provides for the allocation of 250 million euros to strengthen the phases of screening and diagnostics, with the possibility of financing the Regions to follow this path. Mr. Deputy Minister, at this stage when the virus seems to be less aggressive, we could develop these issues. We see that sometimes the debate on this is very broad; my advice is to avoid doing what has happened in recent months, with people from academia and health care who say a bit about everything on television. I am not talking about you, Mr Deputy Minister, because you have always talked about these issues with great preparation and in a very moderate and quiet way, without ever wanting to appear as the one who has the truth in his pocket. Too many people, however, have left us amazed to see what was happening between those who were to govern the emerging phase. We've heard academics say everything and the opposite of everything. It is no longer possible, nor acceptable to proceed in this direction in the coming months, because this creates alarm among people. If there is no security in the direction in which we go, incredible problems are created which can hardly be solved even by economic interventions. In fact, the repercussions of the health emergency can be really heavy; we all know - and we are considering it these days - what is happening. We have tabled the motion constructively, and we have been thinking about it for a long time. We know that the mother of all battles is the one to prevent the repetition of a situation of gravity and health emergency such as that we have experienced in recent months. This is the mother of all battles; there is no more important battle because the others descend from it. If we boost the economy, but people are back afraid to take the virus, then the economic recovery of our country becomes a problem. The phases of screening, monitoring, enhancement of territorial medicine and diagnostics become fundamental. The intervention must be done massively, not with the Immuni app, nor with 150,000 tests. 10 million tests must be carried out, as is the case in Germany. We don't make anything up; it's something someone's already doing. It is in this direction that we have tabled the motion, in a constructive spirit and without any will to put flags. I think that the whole Senate should agree with these positions, because - I repeat - they are the ones that can guarantee a better future for our citizens.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6548200249671936, 0.3451800048351288]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, with this question, Senator Castaldi - whom I also meet in the Industry Committee of which he is one of the most active members - asks the Government to know what initiatives are being taken, in the field of car liability, to promote effective surveillance measures in order to avoid cartel strategies among insurance companies to the detriment of consumers, so as to also adopt provisions to ensure lower premiums for insured persons, greater transparency and greater competitiveness in the sector. <p> Preliminarily, Senator Castaldi recalls the investigative activity initiated by the Competition Authority and the market also following some declarations by the Generali and Unipol groups, with which it was feared the risk of a mitigation of the competitive dynamics on RC car prices with forecasts of rise of the prices of the policies, after a long phase of descent of the last period. The questioners also recall the conclusions of a survey closed in 2013 by the Antitrust Authority, which highlighted a number of potential barriers to competition and proposed several pro-competitive measures. The same Authority has repeatedly intervened on these realities stimulating concrete competition for the benefit of consumers, not least, as is known, through a speech by President Giovanni Pitruzzella of October 2015, at a hearing at the 10th Permanent Senate Committee on the Draft Competition Law. This bill, which is about to be voted in the Chamber in the next few weeks, to pass - at second reading of the novel articles - to the definitive approval of the House, as acknowledged by the questioners themselves, contains provisions to ensure transparency of the market for the benefit of consumers, with particular regard to virtuous motorists, reducing the present territorial imbalances. With regard to the questions put, in the substance of the question, it should be pointed out that the act itself proposes, among the measures relating to the insurance sector (Articles 2-15), a series of measures aimed at promoting competition and promoting the transparency and knowledge of market actions for the benefit of consumers, including a real competitive comparison between the main players in the sector. In particular, provision is made for a comprehensive system of discounts of greater benefit for the virtuous insured persons of the Provinces with the highest accident rate and with the highest average premium for those who submit the vehicle to preventive inspection and who agree to install on their vehicle the so-called black box, on the basis of criteria and methods of determination regulated and monitored by the Institute for Insurance Supervision (IVASS). The reform of the RC auto brings a series of further interventions in favor of consumers and virtuous insured persons, with reference to the assignment of the merit classes, with prohibition to discriminate according to the duration of the relationship, in order to guarantee, within the class of belonging, the conditions of merit assigned to the insured persons having the same risk characteristics of the subject who enters into the new contract. There are also rules of greater advantage for those who have installed the so-called black boxes on the Audi A4 than those otherwise applied, i.e. through the provision of discounts for those who subject the vehicle to prior inspection or, again, install electronic mechanisms on the Audi A4 which prevent the start of the engine if there is a high alcohol content. In particular, the further discount to which reference has previously been made, characterized by a greater consistency and incisiveness than that also applied already in the occasion of the subscription of the aforementioned contractual clauses offered by the company, will have as its aim the valorization (of course economic) of those virtuous behaviors kept from the motorists and aimed to counter the spread of the frauds to the insurances. These measures aim precisely to mitigate the specific weight of territoriality in the determination of insurance premiums. I conclude with the hope that Parliament will be able to adopt these rules quickly, so that we can come to the conclusion of this process in order to meet both the needs of consumers and the commitments made with the European Union.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.508212149143219, 0.491787850856781]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> BERTUZZI (<PARTY>).

Mr President, when a mayor and his administrators hear that the government has finally allocated funds to the suburbs through a ban, they are certainly happy. It is normal for every administrator to be happy: finally someone who thinks about the outskirts, the discomfort of the degraded areas, the neighborhoods without lighting, the broken sewers, the roads to be redone, the sidewalks with the architectural barriers, all those emergency interventions that, for one reason or another, have never been able to do right there, in those suburbs that are all too often forgotten. This, in fact, is the idea that you have of a periphery: a suburb always neglected and in need of interventions, to give it back life and decorum. In these days we have seen strange articles in the newspapers and since we are particularly curious we went to see the projects of the 96 municipalities that participated in the ban. I do not go into the matter whether they are feasible or not (it is not our job to judge them, for that there are technicians), but I believe that a reflection on how citizens\\' money is spent is at least necessary. I must say that we have found many serious projects worthy of all the commitment and attention of the Government to continue their implementation and their feasibility. However, Mr President, since some senators insist on erecting a paladin of the outskirts, let me tell them, hoping to be denied, what will actually go in some cases to finance the outskirts ban, in addition to the serious projects I was talking about earlier. I only mention a few, because if I had to do it with everyone I read, I wouldn\\'t have enough minutes. Among the famous 96 municipalities, which are eagerly waiting for 1.5 billion from the state, I found funding from North to South, in addition to the now famous Ravenna boat, of this type: a beautiful picnic park in Caltanissetta, the creation of an application Beacon to make the tourist guide in Syracuse, a master conference project in Carbonia, a project Card and App lands and lakes in Verbania, a media library of the Dolomites in Belluno, a cineteca and a corridor cycle-eco-ortivo in Bologna, a glorious emotional museum titled \"From prehistory to the future.\" <p> Mr Laus (<PARTY>).

Feasibility studies worthy of note, which abound almost more than projects: in Ancona we do the specialized study for the implementation of urban resilience, but they are not less to Aosta, Nuoro and Potenza, besides Matera and Pisa, which I mentioned before. More than ban on the outskirts, it could be called a ban on feasibility studies. After all, a feasibility study is not denied to anyone, whether they are offended by their consulting friends! <p> Mr President, it is normal that we cannot and must not make the whole grass a bundle, but I have a great esteem for the small municipalities and for those mayors who know how to roll up their sleeves, the same mayors who, for the most part, the holes on their streets if they go to close them alone, perhaps paying also the bag of asphalt of their pocket, those who know what it means degraded periphery and isolated fraction, mayors who, when they make a ban, do it seriously and respect its rules and addresses. <p> My respect goes to all those mayors, while I hope that others today, instead, will make a serious reflection. <p> With this closing reflection I declare the vote in favour of the Lega-Salvini Group Premier - Sardinian Action Party to the motion tabled by the majority groups. <p> .

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday in Milan the third woman disfigured by acid. Ilaria, Alessandra, Chiara are only the last victims of feminicide in the last few hours, after Denise, Michela and Lucia. A chain of violence and death that affected 24 women only in the first four months of this year and 124 in 2012. It is a sad chain that must be broken as soon as possible. In more than half of the cases the feminicide was committed by the partner as part of an ongoing or recently completed relationship, whether spouse, cohabitant, boyfriend or ex. The authors of feminicide are for 79 percent Italian men, and only a small part of these crimes occurred at the hands of strangers. This tells us the data of the \"Shadow Report\" of civil society on the condition of women in Italy. The media often present cases of feminicide as the result of passionate crime, sudden and unpredictable action by men who are victims of raptus and homicidal madness. In reality they are the epilogue of a growing one-way violence, caused by the inability to accept separations, by jealousy, by a feeling of wounded pride, by the will of revenge and punishment against a woman who has transgressed to a model of traditional behavior. A role that in Italy is still relegated to that of mother and wife, or object of sexual desire.

Madam President, Mr Senators and Senators, a few days ago - on 5 May - the European Commission estimates that the European area and our country will recover - albeit in decimal terms - in terms of GDP, employment and inflation. We know, however, that there are sometimes great differences behind the figures and averages and there are, for example, differences not only in Europe, but also, of course, in our own country. The average tends, by its nature, to be a liar and to conceal these differences. If there must be - as there must be - stable and lasting growth, to be such, it cannot be spotted by leopard. There must be organic growth: there can be no low-growth areas, as is our Mezzogiorno, for example, and higher-growth areas, such as the North of our country. Therefore, it is necessary for politics to take responsibility for having a global vision, carrying out interventions in support of homogeneous growth, which is in turn a multiplier: it allows to increase growth, it feeds itself. We are therefore faced with this reality, the Sardinian one, which sees an island, a region with all the indices, as has been listed by those who preceded me and as is contained in the same motions, highly differentiated from the national average. It is a region with structural weaknesses, which in this debate have all been extensively listed. We have a number of problems: from energy costs to internal transport costs; from the great difficulties of maritime and air transport connecting Italy and Sardinia to military services; from the crisis of industrial areas to the problems of the downsizing of certain services of the State, such as justice, for example, the school; to the downfall - I would say free - of the agro-industrial sector. I was surprised that in the motions that have been presented there has been a reduced space - even in some cases it has not even been mentioned - for the great theme of tourism. A tourism that has been reduced to the smallest terms in Sardinia, which should instead be the home of tourism, for demagogic choices that have been reported in this House by the Senator Council, even if tourism never succeeds alone - and this applies to Italy, France, Sardinia and any nation or area in the world - to compensate for the loss of the industrial capacity of services to produce wealth and well-being. Tourism is not enough on its own, but this peculiarity needs to be strengthened, and it is of course necessary to strengthen Sardinia's infrastructure, services and transport. Finally, I would like to stress one last point. Reading the motions it is clear that the spirit that moves them is Sardinian: they are written and shared by senators of Sardinia (and can only be so), who live closely the discomfort of the economic crisis, the discomfort of this wonderful land, perhaps one of the most beautiful in the world. Yet in all this there is always only one indication: the responsibility of the central state for the economic backwardness of this island. I think that the central state, as Senator Carraro recalled, has many responsibilities, but not all. I ask you whether it is possible that everything is always done because of the central state. Certainly this is the case in the case, for example, of floods or in the case of some measures that were to be taken, even on the tax, and have not been done, but is it possible that there is also a co-responsibility of the political class that has governed or governed this region in all these years? A local ruling class that has not done all it can to strengthen the excellence of this island, instead sticking only to welfare policies and inefficient? Is the economic crisis not also fueled by the proliferation of interventions and by the logic of assistance? And would it not have been more profitable to help local entrepreneurship, micro-entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises to become medium-sized and large enterprises? I believe that the motions call for a series of commitments to the Government which, if I may say so, are a little too numerous. I therefore find them reductive or generic, if not that, which instead seems more productive than all the others, which commits the Government to make Sardinia a national issue, as recalled by the motion submitted by Senator Uras, and consequently to give body to the establishment of a coordination committee between national government and regional government in the shortest possible time, and this is not indicated in the motions, because the variable time is fundamental to facilitate or to remove virtuous visions in relation to growth, work and employment. The premises of these motions are therefore valid, dispersive instead in the commitments that would have been best concentrated in a single commitment: that of making Sardinia the national question. We in the People's Area Group will vote in accordance with the instructions of the Government in this House.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6151087880134583, 0.38489118218421936]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a decree to extend deadlines is a clear defeat for the government which has launched it. From the extreme ratio, in recent years it has become a wild card to save itself from unfulfilled deadlines. A tactical maneuver that highlights the inability of Palazzo Chigi to plan an efficient political strategy for the country; a measure whose absurdities are many: the necessary extension of Naspi so that workers in involuntary unemployment do not lose their rightful support caused by the lack of a reform of welfare; the incomprehensible repetition of the appointment, with a compensation of 100,000 euros, of the commissioner ad acta for the earthquake of Irpinia back in 1980; the incredible postponement for the twelfth time of the term to attribute to the prefects the task of soliciting the municipalities in the approval of forecast budgets; the instrumental extension of contracts of the fixed-term employees of the Provinces to postpone the solution of the long-term problem of the contrast between the referendum and the Delrio law. Among the most critical points of this decree, however, there is the extension of the application of the Bolkestein Directive to 2018, an unholy decision dictated above all by a promise made by the former Premier for electoral purposes. On this issue has been done, from the implementation decree of 2010 to the agreement in the unified conference of 2012, moreover legitimized - I emphasize - also by the Constitutional Court, in order to ensure an adequate planning of the work of the parties involved. On this basis many regions and hundreds of municipalities in December had begun the selection procedures and opened the stage of submission of applications for the allocation of new concessions. But now everything is suspended in a legal limbo. What should Municipalities and Businesses do? The Government has created a total interpretative confusion and so the administrations have responded in a disorganic way: some municipalities have suspended the calls while others have decided to continue the procedures anyway and others still do not know how to behave. This normative disorder has only fueled tensions and chaos that also resulted in yesterday's demonstration, in which a squadron of streetwalkers, not belonging to any national organization of category, held a road hostage, blocked the work on the measure and, if not enough, was received in the Senate. Attitude to say the least censorable, because it creates a dangerous precedent and because it gives the idea that in this country it gets more those who resort to force and disorder than those who move within legality. On the contrary, it must be appreciated the balance adopted by the entrepreneurial associations of Confcommercio and Confesercenti that, with a constructive dialectic, have carried out their right demands in order to safeguard their associates, small family enterprises whose economic future is connected to their activity. Following yesterday's protest in Piazza, the Commission had to find a square with a salomonic solution, approving an amendment proposing the extension of concessions to 31 December 2018, while allowing municipalities to start bans even before that date. In short, a downward pact for those thousands of companies that, in view of the new legislation, had already started their obligations, also supporting the related costs. Let's be frank: Bolkestein is a crazy directive, but Palazzo Chigi does not have the strength to oppose it and he bends again in Brussels to avoid intensifying the already heavy tensions with Europe. Also in this case, the reason of state is not compatible with the reasons of the country that produces, but it is known: this Government always puts the games of palace before the interests of Italians.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7837820649147034, 0.21621792018413544]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, I met Senator Caridi in 1997, when he was about 28 years old and had just been elected City Councillor, because I went to Reggio Calabria to present my book \"Stories of extraordinary injustice.\" I had chosen Reggio Calabria because former mayor Pierino Battaglia and former Congressman Quattrone had taken months or years in prison, accused of being the perpetrators of the assassin of the president of the Ligato railroads, and then had been acquitted with full formula. It was one of many cases of history of extraordinary injustice and I found myself in a crowded room because Quattrone and Battaglia, especially the latter, were considered by public opinion as people of integrity. They had suffered this incredible judicial ordeal and the shame of prison for months or years and then had been acquitted with full formula. I have the memory of this affair and this young city councilman. <p> Then, Mr President, I also have the memory of parliamentary classrooms and parliamentary events, such as the one in which the roundabouts were handed over by the National Convention to the executioners and their heads were cut off because, as is well known, this House decided by a majority to hand them over to the scaffold because they had political differences with the Jacobine majority. I can recall, again in the use of the parliamentary regulations, that the Fascists had the possessors deceased by Members using a regulatory instrument: they did not participate in the Assembly and were therefore declared to have fallen. This is to say that in parliamentary history there are shameful episodes that history has then recognized as such and that we risk repeating today in this House. <p> I have not yet heard anyone, except the President of the Council, explain to me what is the single and specific episode in which Senator Caridi would have favored, as executor, the Mafia. I see in the gallery the journalist Milella, of the Republic, but not only her, all the newspapers, this morning, have continued to write the old version, that Senator Caridi is the head of the dome of the Mammasantissima: it has escaped them that this accusation has totally fallen. Today it is not asked the arrest of Caridi because he is the head of something, but because he would be a simple executor; I do not say a labourer of the \\'ndrangheta, but he would have a role, used when he was city councilor or provincial or senator, to cure these interests. <p> The rapporteur says, with a phrase that I will repeat and on which I will write a book, that it is not implausible that this has happened. Now, the expression \"not implausible\" means that it is not to be excluded, but they have explained to us that he must go to prison without the problem of danger of escape, pollution of evidence or recurrence of the crime, but because, being a mafia offense, the prison automatically triggers if there is evidence or serious clues. I haven\\'t seen evidence. <p> What is the specific act that he would commit to favor the \\'ndrangheta or the mafia? Yes, in the record there is the recruitment of five ecological operators - sweepers, let\\'s be clear - for a fixed time. So, in his fifteen years as alderman and whatever else, he would be guilty of hiring five people, I imagine in competition with all the politicians from Calabria, Sicilian, Apulian or Campania, because when they did the aldermen, it would have happened to them too to hire in the companies of the censored people, who have nothing to do with the mafia. That would be the indication. And then there are two or three interceptions that - alas - have been totally denied by the facts. <p> But it is said - and, colleagues, I call everyone to this principle - that he was a friend of Francesco Chirico. Francesco Chirico militated in his party, he was an uncensored person, but he helped him, when he was elected City Councillor, to collect the votes. What\\'s the problem, if an uncensored person, a city employee, helped him pick up the votes? With this person then broke relationships, as shown by the cards, because, thinking the Chirico to be then favored by the Caridi, when the latter did not promote him, he became his bitter enemy. <p> Then it is argued: it is true that Francesco Chirico is incensured, but he has relations with a mafia family. It is a problem that I have talked about a thousand times in this House and which applies to the South, to Modena, as well as to Lombardy: what should an honest person do if in the regions with high mob density has affinity or relation to dishonest people? You don\\'t have to go to work anymore? Does he no longer have to carry out a professional activity? Must he be struck by anti-mafia interdictive because his brother married a woman who is the daughter of someone \"who is part of\"? That of personal civil, administrative and criminal liability that is different from hearing or kinship is a problem that I have posed a thousand times. But here it is charged to the Caridi for having had the electoral support of an honest and uncensored person because she has relatives. <p> Do we want to talk about the other queen test of the senator and undersecretary Valentino and one such Romeo who was, at the time, censored and who two years ago was received here in the Senate, after the conviction, in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (not Caridi, Romeo was welcomed here in the Senate and participated)? If anyone had the patience to read the ten pages in which Senator Valentino and Romeo and Caridi talk about his candidacy, he would find one of the most beautiful pages of transparency and honesty I have ever seen. Because they only talk about Calabria\\'s development and innovative ideas. Valentino remembers that he comes from the right so he has no culture of government, while... (The President spoke with Senator Secretary Scoma). I\\'d like to speak to the president, sorry. I repeat, I would like to speak to the President. Since I have to address the President, I would like the President to listen to me. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. The House, too. GIOVANARDI (<PARTY> (GS, PPI, M, Id, ApI, E-E, MPL)). Yes, to the House, but I have to address the President and then to the House, but I have been referred to many times for the fact that I have to address the President. I was saying, it is one of the most beautiful pages of transparency, because Valentino remembers that it comes from the right, that it has no culture of government, and the Caridi instead comes from a Christian-demochristian family, that the father was a recordman of preferences, like his uncle, Bruno Porcino, doctor esteemed and everything else. At the end of this conversation, the Undersecretary for Justice Valentino, who is currently one of the most respected Italian lawyers, never reached by any suspicion, says: Caridi, once elected - he wanted to be mayor or deputy mayor - remember that you have to pay us a bill of exchange! And down laughs from everyone. Well, the bill of exchange is the queen\\'s proof of his affiliation and participation at the top of the dome. When you read something like this, you think that any of your colleagues can be dragged into an infamous judicial affair by someone who really takes fireflies for lanterns. Or perhaps he has never participated and does not know that, when the Head of State deals with the formation of the new Government and the appointment of Ministers, he examines the characteristics of each person, saying \"yes,\" \"no.\" Or I think of the formation of a municipal council: if the mayor is of a party, the deputy mayor will be of another party, because - it is called democracy - we must take into account the relations of force, especially between parties. If this is bad luck. Then there\\'s the bill that Valentino talked about, which would be proof. That is the main evidence and the meeting with the person who was in jail is the other evidence that is being carried. Due to the circumstances that are charged to him, there is no other proof that this, that is the fact that he would be chatted to Reggio Calabria, certainly not to Cuneo, to have frequentations or knowledge in a reality where the cosche, unfortunately, exist. I\\'d like to know who can defend themselves against general accusations of this kind. It has rightly been said that there is a trial and, in that context, he will assert his reasons and the prosecution will try to prove its own. I remember - I wrote it in the book - that, at the time, 90% of my 90 incriminated colleagues were acquitted. The crime was not prescribed, but it was absolution or storage because the crime charged did not exist. I am talking about parliamentarians and the years 1992-1994. I repeat: this has happened 90 times in 100. Here is a request to send Senator Caridi to jail, to jail him, to make him lose his personal freedom, to destroy his family tranquillity and to give an image of his colleagues who believe that he is a criminal. In these three years - it\\'s known to everyone, isn\\'t it? - he has conditioned the work of Parliament. It\\'s obvious: we all know that Senator Caridi was the black man who determined the Senate\\'s address over the years, didn\\'t we? As a senator, he definitely didn\\'t. Moreover, it has been said and demonstrated in Junta that we are talking about things that have happened in the last eighteen years: the first interceptions date back to the years 1997-1998 and then there are those of 2002. There are acts that have been examined in so many trials, in which other people, including their competitors, have rightly been condemned. Caridi was not elected to the regional elections and the votes of the families were insufficient for him, but not for other candidates who in the trials emerged as beneficiaries. If St. Luke\\'s thigh (I think the Pelle clan) supported him, how to explain that in that country he obtained 22 votes, while the first took 120 votes and, to follow, the others? I repeat: how can we say that Caridi obtained the support of the \\'ndrangheta of San Luca if in that country he obtained 22 votes and the other 120? That\\'s what I asked for in Junta. In Giunta, in the defense that he had to rabble in a few days and that he illustrated yesterday morning, Caridi provided all the electoral tables and explained by thread and sign things. If he said false things, it is right that he should go to prison, but if he said true things because the Junta did not verify - he could do so - the truthfulness of his statements? Why do we have to vote whether or not to send him to prison if, in an investigation that lasted a few hours and with three interruptions (we had to be here for the votes), no one was able to read the last 1,500 pages, nor to carefully evaluate what he said? If what he said is true, why does he have to go to jail? But why should he lose his personal freedom, among other things since the review court has to decide on August 13? Colleagues, with the secret vote you have to look inside and think that this is something that can happen to everyone. <p> Yes, accusations of this kind can happen to everyone, because when they are built on nothing they can happen to everyone to be in this situation. We assume the responsibility of sending into prison on the basis not of some concrete element, but of assumptions. <p> Mr President - and we will also say this in an explanation of vote - there is a lack of minimum elements to remove personal freedom from a Member of Parliament and to change arrangements. This is what Mr Malan said, although clearly paradoxically: if Senator Caridi had not been there with his vote, the history of the Italian Parliament and the Government would have changed, there would have been no decisive vote and there would have been other political directions. Of course, he said it as a paradox, but we have seen that even the lack or presence of a Member of Parliament can be decisive: see the fall of Berlusconi, at the time, when a budget document was not adopted, since its vote ended in balance. In that case there was a lack of a Member, for whom the House of Deputies had granted arrest, who was therefore in prison, and who was then acquitted. Therefore, his physical lack has determined a different direction and orientation of Italian political life. Sending a Member of Parliament to prison, beyond his personal problems, is a very serious injury to the composition of the Senate and if it is decided on the basis of the non-indications we have had these days, I think it would be a very sad day for Parliament and the institutions.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6257866024971008, 0.3742133677005768]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, I would like to say a few things which are more tactical than strategic but which have their importance. <p> As far as the income of citizenship is concerned, I think it is unthinkable to hand over to employment centres the control of such a law, because they exist only on paper; this mechanism has been working since the old employment office. <p> In other words, the company hires workers and then gives their name and surname to the employment centre, which has only notary tasks and therefore cannot control such an important and expensive law. Don't joke about it. Before making the citizenship income, we must do the control tool, otherwise we will find ourselves in a very negative situation. <p> Another important point concerns pensions. As we know, the so-called Fornero law has affected two types of pensions: retirement pensions, by removing the quotas to which they were linked, and old-age pensions, given to citizens who have not worked enough, i.e. contributions to the INPS for at least thirty-five years. The Fornero law has stated that you reach the retirement pension at sixty-six years and seven months. <p> Now, if you really want to change that idea, you have to remember that the so-called Tremonti law, made in order to safeguard the INPS coffers, provides - fortunately - that every year the increase in the age for the old-age pension is linked to the life expectancy established by ISTAT; therefore, the automatic effects of the Tremonti law on the old-age pension must be stopped. It would not be the first because it has already been done, but it is something to be done immediately, one of the first things to do, otherwise everyone is talking about reforms that would not be possible at all.

The role of the Parliamentary Commission for the general direction and supervision of broadcasting services, set up to ensure, through parliamentary control, the principle of pluralism of information, is traced back to this original mission. <p> Mr President, I\\'m sorry, but I can\\'t even speak with this buzz. <p> RANUCCI, rapporteur. As I said, the principle of pluralism of information is traced back to this original mission, eliminating, on the other hand, tasks that interfere with the management of society and its governance. The foregoing, in full respect, and indeed in coherence and implementation of the constitutional framework as outlined, in particular, by the case law of the Court, since Judgment No 225 of 1974. It is not by chance that the principles relating to the revocation of the members of the Management Board have been transposed into law, and their effectiveness has been influenced by the scrutiny of the aforementioned Parliamentary Commission. The principle that the governing bodies of the managing institution are not so constituted as to represent directly or indirectly the exclusive or predominant expression of the executive power is also safeguarded and that their structure is such as to ensure their objectivity. In this sense, the bill provides for the appointment by the Government of only two members. In addition, the rule aims to ensure, including through employee participation in the appointment of the administrative body, that the editorial lines are based on criteria of impartiality and pluralism. On a text that I think is already good, the Commission has done a very careful job. That is why I must thank all the members of the Commission, by majority and opposition, who have further helped to improve it. As regards Article 1 of the draft law, which states that Article 45 of the single text of audiovisual and radio media services in relation to the rules governing public service contracts provides, inter alia, for the extension of the period from three to five years, the main changes made during the examination in 8a. The Commission is concerned with the inclusion of the reference to the concession granting RAI the role of the national public service service operator and, in particular, with regard to the provisions on public service locations in the territories where linguistic minorities are present, the identification of a solution for the issue of the broadcasting convention between the Autonomous Province of Bolzano and RAI, a solution which also defines financial aspects. In relation to Article 2 of the text, which deals with Article 49 of the single text in order to outline the new governance framework of the RAI, 8a First of all, the Commission supplemented the requirements for the appointment of a member of the Management Board, specifying that it should be carried out in such a way as to ensure gender equality, the balance between the professionalism and experience of the members, the absence of conflicts of interest and the accumulation of positions in competing companies. The members of the Management Board shall also be chosen from among persons of recognised good repute. Compared to the text presented, it was then re-introduced that the appointment of the Chairman of the Management Board would become effective after obtaining the favourable opinion, expressed by a two-thirds majority, of the Parliamentary Supervisory Committee on broadcasting services. In addition, the Chairman may be entrusted by the Board of Directors in the areas of external and institutional relations and supervision of internal control activities, after a resolution of the meeting authorising the delegation. The 8th Commission then intervened to specify that the appointment of members by the Council of Ministers, on a proposal from the Minister of Economic Affairs, should be in accordance with the criteria and arrangements for the appointment of members of the administrative bodies of subsidiaries directly or indirectly by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as set out in the Directive of the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance of 24 June 2013, and that the member of the board designated by the RAI employees\\' meeting must have the requirement of at least three consecutive years of employee employment with that company. There was also an intervention on how to select parliamentary designation components, introducing transparent procedures, which provide for the publication on the Internet of both the selection notices and the curricula of the participants, as well as on the procedures for the election of the component expressed by the RAI employee assembly, in order to ensure the participation and secrecy of the vote. With regard to the revocation of members of the Board, it is laid down that it shall take effect if it is in accordance with the resolution of the Parliamentary Supervisory Committee on RAI. Further integration approved by the 8th Commission requires the Chairman of the Management Board and two members, identified by the Board, to carry out monitoring and monitoring functions on the implementation by the company of the programming lines and guidelines, on the development and marketing of the audiovisual product, on the development of the portal and on the use of its content through new devices and platforms and on the quality of the programming of the public radio and television service, with a half-yearly report on the work carried out. I would like to open a small parenthesis and remind you that at present RAI\\'s board of directors is convened, sometimes every fifteen days, since there is a need, because there is no one who can make the decisions. There is, therefore, a need for the council to take the decisions. In this new structure, the board of directors will be convened whenever necessary, like all other boards of directors (four or five times a year), but within it there will be committees as on all boards of directors of participating companies or public limited companies having duties. We wanted to point out that, given the delicacy of the public service, within the board of directors the president and two advisors will only report to the board the progress of cultural activity and public service. As regards the CEO, the 8th Commission supplemented the text in question with regard to both the powers and the requirements required to carry out this task. The most important change in relation to the powers of the managing director concerns the appointment of top-level managers, with the introduction of the forecast that for the directors of network, channel and tested is mandatory - but not binding - the acquisition of the opinion of the board of directors. In the case of headmasters, this opinion, if expressed by a two-thirds majority, is binding (I remember that two-thirds are five out of seven members). With regard to the recruitment powers of staff, it has been established that the managing director, after having received the opinion of the board of directors, defines the criteria and modalities for such recruitment as well as those for the assignment of tasks to external collaborators, in accordance with what is indicated, for companies with public participation, in Decree-Law No 112 of 2008, identifying the professional profiles and tasks for which, in relation to the specific tasks assigned, it may derogate from these criteria and modalities. In the course of the Commission\\'s examination, the detailed indication was then introduced of both the causes which may weaken the requirements of good repute and cause the ineligibility or forfeiture in the course of the term of office of CEO and of the professional requirements required to be appointed. In addition, the prohibition for an employee of RAI to become CEO has been abolished, providing that, in the event of appointment, he is required to resign from the company or to take unpaid leave for the duration of the assignment. It has been established that the term of office cannot exceed the expiry of the Management Board, while the possibility of revocation remains entrusted to the Board, after having received the opinion of the Assembly. In addition, in the year following the end of the mandate, the CEO may not take on assignments or provide advice to competing RAI companies. In confirming the functions of general direction and supervision of the public broadcasting services of the Parliamentary Supervisory Committee, already provided for in the original text of the measure, it is stipulated that the Management Board should report on a six-monthly basis (and no longer only annually) before approval of the budget, to that Commission, giving the full list of the names of guests invited or participating in the broadcasts. Finally, the rule on the adaptation of the RAI statute to what was introduced with the measure under consideration is supplemented, providing that the opinion on the amendments to the Statute is expressed exclusively by the extraordinary assembly of the RAI. As regards Article 3, the deletion of paragraph 49-c is a consequence of the placing in Article 2 of the provision of the rules already described. We hope to be able to speak on Article 3 in the course of the debate in this House, because I believe that we will have to make some changes with regard to the competitions for cultural products, which cannot be approved with regard to those for the acquisition of services or goods, but they certainly have different characteristics. The 8th Commission then intervened on Article 4 of the measure, in order to supplement the provisions relating to the delegation to the Government for the discipline of the public financing of the RAI. In particular, the subject of the delegation has been extended to include also the discipline of the financing of the local broadcasting (and this, in my opinion, is an important novelty for all our territories) in order to recognize and qualify the function of public interest carried out and to guarantee to this sector adequate certainty of resources. It has also been specified that the revision of the discipline of the public financing of the RAI is aimed to guarantee economic and financial independence of the society as current concessionaire of the public service. Here too I make a small parenthesis, and I say that, when it comes to RAI independence, this is the fundamental point. We cannot talk about an independent RAI if it is not economically and financially independent. An RAI that should depend every year on the will of any government or any parliament would not really be independent. Let me give you an example. President Carraro is present in the Chamber. Well, the CONI was always independent as long as it could be thanks to Totocalcio. Afterwards, the Italian sport, having lost the Totocalcio and having lost that source of its absolutely autonomous financing, became dependent on the will and decisions of both Parliament and the Government. This RAI can\\'t afford. Further amendments concern the procedure for the adoption of legislative decrees implementing the delegation, with a strengthening of the role of parliamentary committees. This is also very important, as far as the House and the Commission are concerned. In fact, it has been established that the opinions of the relevant Commissions are to be obtained on the schemes, both for the matter and for the financial profiles, providing for the need for a second sending to Parliament if the Government does not intend to comply with the opinions expressed. So, once again, Parliament\\'s centrality is being highlighted. With reference to Article 5, the 8th Commission amended the principles and criteria for the exercise of the delegation conferred on the Government for the revision of the single text of audiovisual and radio media services. In particular, and this is a very important point, as it is a political point of all the Groups, accepting a request made by all the Groups during the debate in the Commission, the delegation criterion for the redefinition of the tasks of the public service was deleted, which also included a reference to the different technological platforms and the needs of technological innovation and the convergences of the distribution platforms. It was considered that this issue deserved to be dealt with in its own right, in an autonomous draft law. And I must thank the Government for agreeing that such an important subject should be dealt with by an autonomous bill. Other changes have also been introduced, including new principles relating to the transmission of content for minors, the broadcasting of television and radio broadcasts throughout the country and in areas where linguistic minorities are present. The procedure for the adoption of the legislative decrees relating to this delegation follows the one already described in Article 4, with the double parliamentary opinion. Article 6 has been amended to allow the application of the provisions on the appointment of the Board of Directors of the RAI, introduced by the text in question, from the date of entry into force of the law. Finally, the first application of the rules introduced with reference to the procedure for the appointment of the members of the Management Board was regulated, which will have to be completed within 30 days of the entry into force of the measure. I would like to conclude with a reflection and a wish. RAI in the 1960s accompanied the country in its growth. The boom years, we all remember. And he told the economy, the society, the culture, the sport of those years. We remember the documentaries on the construction of the Autostrada del Sole, cultural and school programs such as \"Never too late,\" the varieties and sports programs, with the first football news or the mythical \"Process to the stage\". The hope is that the new RAI that will come out of this bill can once again accompany Italy to overcome the current difficult period, putting at the center of its mission the public service and the product, aimed at the cultural, social and economic growth of our country. RAI is not only a great cultural company, but also a flywheel of growth of a great country, which must look to the future with confidence, aware of its great potential.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5430600643157959, 0.4569399356842041]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> MINEO (<PARTY>).

However, I would like to leave to the record my embarrassment and also the deep disagreement over the things that the <PARTY>'s leader, Senator Zanda, said this morning. The first is as follows: by quoting Mrs De Petris who, as we know, is President of the Mixed Group, she told her that she had been elected with the votes of the Democratic Party. I would like to remind Senator Zanda that he and I have also been elected by the votes of the Left, Ecology and Freedom, because in 2013 we presented ourselves with a coalition. I would also like to remind everyone that the majority prize that has been won in the House, and thanks to which an electoral law called Italicum has become the law of the State, has been obtained by the coalition in which there were both Left, Ecology and Freedom that the Democratic Party: so you should be careful to claim the possession of votes: in democracy no one is master of votes. The second thing I would like to say to everyone, Mr President, also to you, is that I was very surprised by a sentence from Senator Zanda when he said that three Senators of the Democratic Party would support the appointment as President of the Mixed Group of Senator De Petris. So, the Democratic Party, without my knowledge, rigged the election of the President of the Mixed Group? And did the presidency of the Senate know? Perhaps that is why there are two Mixed Groups in this House: one called Mixed and the other LAG? I would like to know why it is essential, Mr President, that the rules apply to everyone. Of course, a senator who is not a Holding Company cannot speak on the point of order, but it must also be obvious that there is a Mixed Group. Therefore, I would like to understand who was aware and what the point of that action was this morning unveiled by my President Zanda. I'm not stopping here. I shall be very brief, but I would like to add another point. The rights of the majority cannot always be defended at all costs. If, for example, parliamentarians who were part of a center alliance led by Senator Monti have passed into the ranks... <p> MINEO (<PARTY>). I want to say that if we accept the transitions from one group to another if it suits the majority, then we must also be respectful of minorities. I end by reminding Senator Zanda that I was replaced after starting the preliminary debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and it was said by Senator Zanda that this did not change the substance of Article 67 of the Constitution with regard to the Commissions, that there has never been a debate on this issue, either in the Group or in the Senate.

Not only does he arrive with a disarming delay, but he arrives incomplete and not satisfying. <p> There are regions that have had to compensate for government failures, collecting the demands of the most damaged categories and studying effective and immediate strategies, also drawing on their own funds to support the companies involved in the current crisis. <p> We want here to bring to the attention of the Assembly and of the country the heavy situation in which some regions, in particular mine, are found, due to the crisis caused by the epidemic. <p> The Region with Special Statute Friuli-Venezia Giulia is a virtuous Region, a net contributor as it pays to the State more than it receives. In particular, since 2011 the Region has been obliged to pay to the State an extraordinary contribution which it has requested to suspend, for obvious reasons. <p> Friuli-Venezia Giulia is supplied exclusively through its own resources, without transfers from Rome. <p> On May 30th, twenty-six days after the release from lockdown, twelve days after the reopening of bars, restaurants and other commercial activities, the data of the Higher Institute of Health certified that Friuli-Venezia Giulia is among the Regions with the best results in the fight against coronavirus. Our small, but immense Region, pride of all of us Friulians and Julians, is among the territories not at risk for travel after June 3. Friuli-Venezia Giulia is also the protagonist in the fight against Covid. The hospital in Catinara in Trieste has invested in a new car that has the ability to make 2000 extra swabs a day. This means more quickly identifying the supply chain of the infected and preventing them from becoming unconscious vehicles of the epidemic. Our Governor Fedriga speaks with the facts: he has allocated contributions and incentives for more than 50 million euros for the benefit of businesses and workers, also simplifying bureaucratic practices to facilitate activities in this dramatic phase of war among the poor caused by the Covid-19. Despite this initiative of great help in the fight against the virus, the State demands from Friuli-Venezia Giulia 726 million euros, against a reduction of the revenues estimated in about 700 million. They want to annihilate the Regions and their virtuous autonomy, hitting them to weaken and create the worst of evils: addiction.

Mr President, Mr Bubbico, my fellow Senators, I have given up speaking in the general debate because on this subject the report by the anti-Mafia Commission and the content of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Heads of Groups are exhaustive in many respects. However, I would like to draw the attention, in particular that of the Government, to a number of issues that, if you do not address the substance beyond the formalisms and aspects of purely formal rigour, will make it problematic to achieve the main objective of a full use of this wealth represented by the assets confiscated from the Mafia organizations. The first question I want to put to the attention of the Government is the question of the time between the seizure of assets and their final confiscation. In this period of time, our experience tells us that these assets are subjected to a process of decay and impoverishment that is definitely necessary for the maintenance of the value of the confiscated property. Therefore, on this issue we must focus not only the regulatory attention, but also the sensibilities of the bodies responsible for the seizure and subsequent confiscation, certainly respecting the guarantees provided in the trial, but at the same time being aware that the time in this case must be short, to safeguard the wealth that is placed in the hands of the State. The second issue that I would like to draw to your attention, Mr Vice-Minister and fellow senators, is the quality of judicial administrators. Of course, the register is useful, but if we do not proceed to a selection that introduces elements of high professional and entrepreneurial quality as well as the characteristic element of entrepreneurial action, that is the risk, these companies, which obviously - as you mentioned, Vice Minister - come from a protected market, very often artificial, run very serious risks. Therefore, a strong entrepreneurial capacity must be provided for judicial administrators. Otherwise, the bureaucratic management of the goods, certainly through strict compliance with the rules, but without the application of what is the criterion of the diligence of the good father of the family, that is - using a rather crude term - of the master's eye that fattens the horse, degrades in a particularly serious way the entrusted heritage. We must certainly introduce, Mr Vice-Minister, a provision of risk capital from liquid assets seized: without enhanced risk capital, in fact, many of these companies and many assets are destined for cancellation. Time passes, employment issues are obvious, in many cases the state's performance is simply procrastinated over time, but those businesses and assets are destined to a rather harmful conclusion. Therefore, making venture capital available alongside an effective entrepreneurial professionalism can make it possible to restore to a legal market position those companies that - I repeat - have lived in a protected and very often illegal market. This capital must guarantee the ability to develop entrepreneurial action, as is necessary for any company, even those companies operating in the legal market. Furthermore, specific instruments must be created for goods which cannot survive under the conditions given, territorial and economic contingency, and which must be alienated, because their maintenance in a situation of uncertainty contributes to their destruction from the point of view of the wealth they represent. For companies it certainly poses, in a serious way, the problem of their relocation without being returned to criminal organizations, which can move within an opaque market to recover the goods through a repurchase of the market itself. There is also - and I conclude, ladies and gentlemen - a non-fiction use of all the goods entrusted to the associations and organizations operating in the field of anti-mafia. In the experience of the Anti-Mafia Commission, we have very often felt that it was difficult for these organisations to maintain the goods, under conditions of actual and concrete economic activity, or to finalise them for effective use of the public interest. We must prevent these goods from being parked without knowing that the parking lot is necessary for their perspective. This problem certainly arises for real estate and businesses, but there is a problem related to the movable assets seized. Too many administrations, Minister, are waiting for the allocation, in particular of cars and means of transport they have requested, and the time is too long. We know that, even in this case, the times contribute to the depletion of the good and deprive, among other things, the State and the public territorial administrations of any property which, on the other hand, should be found on the normal market if the assets seized and confiscated are not made available. We need, therefore, strict management not only formal but also substantial attention to the protection of the good and its consistency and, I repeat, the application of the criterion of diligence of the good father of the family, which is what makes any organization work well.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.61784827709198, 0.38215166330337524]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, the 5th Commission is still meeting!

As usual, the sailor\\'s promises, that is, the talk of the DEF and the fanciful numbers of the budget law, make us the usual figure from Pinocchio. I am serene, for goodness sake - in name and in fact - and I would also like to believe with confidence in what Minister Padoan said, which is expecting us to grow by 2%. Honestly, however - it will be because I am a little short-sighted - I cannot go beyond the critical situation in which the real economy is placed, that of the many entrepreneurs and professionals, who are vexed by a thousand amendments and by a thousand uncertainties and by the will to put them all in a position to have to pay always and immediately and instead to receive only if it is good and still late. <p> I am referring in particular to the split payment, which was created with the aim of reducing tax evasion, in order to increase revenue for the State, which, in fact, is not a rain in the wet, but a hail that destroys what is healthy in our real economy. Public administration is the worst client that businesses and professionals can have. Gentlemen, split payment kills businesses. Entrepreneurs and professionals already have to pay in advance 20% of the IRPEF, with the mechanism of withholding tax and have the obligation of electronic invoicing, with the new quarterly transmission of VAT, with the harassment of the spent meter, introduced just to have an anti-evasion instrument, because in this way they trace all the compensation received. In this way we have all become ATMs of a failed and inefficient state. The split payment is nothing more than forceful financing to the state by individuals, businesses and professionals working with the public administration. But not happy, the state, always with its bureaucratic and absurd style, tries to put in a piece that is worse than the hole. We have replaced the efficiency and preparation of the French ENA, which produces enlightened politicians going towards deregulation, simplification and openness, with a degree that seems to be given by the \"office complications simple things.\" Further bureaucracy that consists in having to ask the state what is due to me, with attached costs by private individuals and the revenue agency itself: the administration is so complicated and twisted that it complicates the lives of private citizens, but if it complicates it itself; all in times ranging from six months to two years. In addition, the split payment conflicts entrepreneurs, professionals and companies who boast an ordinary VAT credit to the State and those who are obliged by law to have a VAT credit. There is a competition between private individuals to see their legitimate right guaranteed. The logic would like that, in all cases where it replaces a tax automation with a new procedure, this will be more efficient and make business easier. What happened instead? The Government, far from solving an existing problem, extends this mechanism to all businesses and professionals, subjecting them to useless and harmful barbarity. What you should have done, as a matter of urgency, was one thing: extend the payment of VAT per cash to all categories, thus solving all the related problems and really increasing GDP. Because when you make legal certainty, when expectations are clear and satisfied, there is also an automatic propensity to invest and do business. But if, on the one hand, in order to find resources, we find solutions that are aberrant and harmful to companies, on the other hand we know how to use them; it is disconcerting as in this decree-law, on the one hand, the weight of the maneuvering on the enterprises already massacred by the crisis and without liquidity and, on the other hand, the forage of luxury and the superfluous. Also in this maneuver the Government has reinstated a thoughtful thought to the Ryder Cup 2022, as already attempted in the milleproroghe and in the bill on the competition: it happens, all measures that pass with the confidence and not through the confrontation. Article 63 provides for the granting of EUR 97 million to Ryder Cup Europe, which is added to the share already allocated by the 2017 budget law. Taxpayers pay and pay back: first the public side, now the guarantee for private investment. I understand that banks need guarantees; I understand that they must be very careful, but do I have to be the citizen to assure them? When I go to the bank and ask for a loan, do I always find the door closed? Do I have to vouch for the bank? At the moment, we are linking 97 million which the State could have turned to really urgent and truly indifferent needs. I remind you of the earthquake, which is still there. With regard to the earthquake, the only positive aspect of this decree-law is the establishment of free urban areas, which I have sincerely urged several times. Even a number of drafts of laws are filed, which was enough to copy, but not even that was done, because even in this measure it was possible to make a norm totally averted from reality; a norm that does not take into account how the economy and the country are doing, and has not considered any suggestions. I wonder how we can think of setting up an urban free zone, which has been called upon several times in this House by the undersigned since last December to provide tax benefits - which are well heard - for companies that have had a 20% reduction in turnover, not profit. So, on the one hand, try to curb evasion and, on the other hand, favorite and solicit it. At what time? From 1 September to 31 December 2016. I remind you that the earthquake occurred in August but it is obvious that the damage of the earthquake cannot be limited to 2016 and goes on. All compared to the 2015 period: it would have been useful, fair and reasonable a comparison but not with such a limited period of time and not in these terms. This wording is, in fact, tantamount to not granting the benefit to anyone and ensuring tax evasion for someone who might try. Not to mention the fact that the benefits are granted for only two years, but an investment, if the relief is only two years, does not find refreshment when you go to confront with an already tried and difficult reality at the start. We are in June 2017 and I assure you that the rubble is still there, the reconstruction has not begun and the inspections are not over. We are in total turmoil, but you have also provided for the possibility of facilitating companies investing in these areas. Very well, however, the benefit is limited only to those that start the enterprise, within the free zone, by 31 December 2017. We are in June, there are rubble and there are no roads; but who will invest in those areas by December 2017? In my opinion, this is not serious. It really tastes like teasing. Honestly, a citizen who reads such a rule can only think one thing: that it was made by people who really want to keep the chair because they can only live by politics and do not know what it means to do business, do not know what it means to work, do not know what real life is.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again here in this House we are talking about yet another measure which seeks to solve the now exhausting problem, which we are talking about every day in this House, of the overcrowding of prisons. Let us also remember that in Italy the problems, when they arrive in this House, are almost always incanculated on average. The problem of overcrowding in prisons is not a problem that needs to be solved, as we are trying to do now, with these we continue to call tampon measures. It is a problem that had to be tackled, in a truly systematic way, some time ago, because the only way to try to solve the long-standing issue of an overabundance of prisoners compared to prison capacity was to build new prisons. On the other hand, we find ourselves making a reasoning and an operation exactly contrary to what was to happen upstream. We had to determine the number and size of prisons depending on the number of prisoners and not, at this point, determine the number of prisoners depending on the size of prisons. If at present prisons can accommodate 45,000-47,000 people, we do not understand why we must necessarily release another 20,000. This is a serious problem in Italy. It is a very serious problem that we have not even developed systems for building new prisons. Programs had begun, and then, as always happens in this country, they were abandoned. You start and then you abandon, and you don't carry out a program consistently to the end. Today we find ourselves with the absence of places within these prisons and with a problem, indeed, also of the dignity of the people who have to live in them. But we in the North League continue to say that it is absurd to have to solve a problem like this by adopting, as we are doing now, a continuous myriad of small measures. I would remind you that, from the beginning of the parliamentary term to the present day, we have been discussing this issue in the Justice Committee for most of the time. We continually adopt these measures and we are afraid to arrive, probably, at the beginning of the effects of the Torreggiani judgment, to probably have to adopt a clemential measure. And I doubt that, between the Members present in this House and those in the House of Members, there is the will of all to arrive at an amnesty or an indult. There is a sentence, which is well known, but we know very well that, for our fellow citizens, hearing about amnesty and indult, especially at this time, will be absolutely unacceptable. <p> And neither will the good intentions and the beautiful way of exposing them by President Renzi succeed in convincing our people. We now have yet another measure that provides for more or less forms of liberation or non-incarceration of many criminals. <p> I am here to remind all my colleagues of what we have done, because in July of last year we spoke about the institution of suspension of the sentence, then we came to talk about the extension of the application of the institution of house arrests, until we included in that measure a whole series of depenalizations. In the same measure that is being discussed today in the House, we have begun to talk about the testing institute: we are telling all those who follow our work here in Parliament that there are such penalty discounts for which, as far as early release is concerned, we are going from 45 to 75 days every 6 months, even with a calculation with retroactive effect to 2010. <p> We come to say that to the guilty of a crime can be applied the so-called test: but how do we explain it to the person offended by the crime, to those who have suffered it, to those who are victims and you see that criminal sentenced to house arrest - that then, however limiting it may be to stay at home, you will understand me if I say that it is always better than being inside a cell - or to follow the reeducational path of testing, that can even lead to the extinction of the crime? We can say that, counting early release in what should have been the penalty, one finds himself being released first. <p> This is incomprehensible to all people, at a time when - just read the newspapers - we talk about continuous robberies and robberies in the apartment. These are the problems. We can stay here and talk about the electoral law, our Senate and the fate that it will have, but then, in the end, what matters to the people who are at home really seeing what we are doing is getting to the end of the month, living in a quiet country, being able to do their expenses and their holidays, following their children, paying their preschool fees and seeing criminals punished. <p> And that is what we are not doing: the feeling of those who are criminals and who are outside of this Chamber is that so much, here in Italy, for a certain crime and for a certain penalty you can find some way to get ahead, sooner or later a measure containing a benefit eventually comes. <p> That is not the message we need to pass on. We at the North League are not executed, as we may be accused of being. We are just saying that in a society like ours, in a moment of economic crisis, which - let us remember - becomes social, if certainties are removed from families and people, we must give a feeling of rigour. We must convey a feeling of rigour in our work and trials, so that we know, for example, that those who commit a crime go to jail and are punished as planned. Or at least we have to show that the process is being conducted over an ordinary period of time, to be considered reasonable. <p> In Italy this is not happening: if one today arrives in a court, he finds himself with the hearings of the cases postponed to absurd and incomprehensible times. <p> The citizen wonders, but where is justice? And the question arises spontaneously: where is politics? What we need to do is not get lost in solving the single problem that appears to be an emergency. Rather, we must look at everything from a truly global, systematic and general perspective in order to understand what we want to do with this country. <p> We in the North League will continue this battle, which we will do in this House and outside, and will continue to insist on maintaining rigour and great seriousness in what we do.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7250410914421082, 0.27495890855789185]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> SMALL (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Secretary-General, our Group will vote in favour of the motion tabled by the majority, at the first signature of Senator Morgoni. It proposes a comprehensive set of indications on the potential use of secondary solid fuel in certain specific types of industrial plants: cement plants in particular. The document sets out as an expression of a first phase of direction oriented to respond with concrete initiatives, I would like to say 'of doing', to complex issues in environmental and health protection that require urgent action to supplement the policies that have so far been activated, in the light of the increasing increase in the production of waste and the search for new solutions, in the light, moreover, of the need to provide, at all stages of implementation, clear indications to the local communities closest to the plants. Given the vastness of the matter, it is only possible to dwell on a few points. The first point is as follows: In particular, the motion requires the Government a series of actions that, if read in an isolated way, may seem obvious but for which, on the contrary, an overall analysis is required, aimed at highlighting its methodological significance and the potential of the system. I'll explain. What, on the whole, the motion requires with force and immediacy is an activity of comparison with existing experiences, of careful analysis and technical-scientific analysis of the effects of each action, without preconceptions, hasty conclusions and lack of checks declare a priori the percorsibility or non-corribibility of a solution. The second point I would like to make is the following. It should be recalled that the re-use for energy and productive purposes of secondary solid fuel has already been the subject of special discipline, in particular - as provided for in Ministerial Decree No 22 of 2013 - regarding control activities. In the same way, the results of experimental scientific studies have made it possible to detect an improvement in the emissive impact of the combustions carried out in cement factories when CSS was used in co-combustion. However, there are questions to be answered in detail on the combination of technology - human health - and the environment. Thirdly, while maintaining, therefore, a constant activity of technical research that allows to update the technological and operational conditions to be followed carefully in order to allow the use of CSS in industrial plants, initiatives are proposed to the Government closely related to the concept of transparency in the application of industrial processes. Precisely in order to combine the pragmatism of the initiatives with the protection of the health of the citizens and the compatibility with the environment, there is a system in which the use of secondary solid fuel is subject to constant monitoring and information. In addition to the provision of specific rules for the full compliance with Community provisions and the establishment of appropriate monitoring bodies, it is important to require the activation of a system - as already mentioned in other interventions - of permanent environmental monitoring, with the obligation to publish results on line as they are collected; in this way a clear and dynamic system of comparison with the territory where the plants are located is launched. Among other things, it should be said that this scheme for the control of effluents and monitoring and reporting of operating conditions can be ensured by effective and reliable systems for detecting indicators, both general and punctual, against reduced costs. It is clear, then, as a system of authorizations for the exercise, structured on the basis of elements of clarity and equipped to provide continuous information, it is a tool of greater guarantee for the success of investments too often subject, in our country, to continuous uncertainties - I would say uncertainties until the last bolt, with a joke - with the very harmful consequence of discouraging investors. The fourth point to highlight is the following. It is therefore a question of sharing a method that subsequently leads to the construction of an implementation model of greater guarantee than the policies so far followed. It goes without saying that such a step also requires a constant and objective search for the instruments that will demonstrate the greatest degree of adequacy to all the underlying problems. The motion thus provides a set of very precise methodological indications (many twelve points) which require a strong guarantee of the seriousness of the approach. These include a commitment to update sector legislation as a result of the suggested process. Fifth, it is considered appropriate to recall the comforting experience - also mentioned in the motion and in other interventions - of other European nations, in some of which the reuse of waste in cement factories is a widespread, tried and tested practice, considered beneficial for the environment when compared with the use of fossil fuels and with practices of high compatibility. The technologies applied have allowed the combustion of SSCs to be recognised at European level as the best practice available with ever-growing heat replacement rates for fossil fuels. In 2011 these values were 98 percent in the Netherlands, 61 percent in Germany, 45 percent in Austria and Poland, 30 percent in France. Values that you comment on yourself. Sixthly, on the whole, the actions of analysis, information and monitoring are therefore asked of the Government immediately, so that the practice of the use of secondary solid fuels eventually becomes operational and I would like to say serenely applicable also in our Country, including among the good practices aimed at guaranteeing a long-term solution in the treatment of waste or of a portion of them through, it is clear, the preparation of specific guidelines to follow with scrupulousness.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representative of the Government, we are about to vote on one of the last initiatives of the Letta Government, serenely put to the door by its successor through yet another rotation not legitimized by the popular vote. The advent of the Renzi Government was justified by the need to change direction and change step, with miraculous results from the air of a good turn. However, with the passage of time and having the opportunity to verify the poor results, we cannot but say that, beyond the adjectives and epithets that echo the slogan that we read on our highways \"You are in a wonderful country,\" this Government is very far, if not unable to guide Italy in the direction of growth, development and employment. Studying and reading this bill with great care only exposes two important aspects: first, the Renzi Government continues without any innovative contribution what the previous Government has begun. Secondly, the same approach and method is found in all the activities of the Government and the parliamentary majority as in all the left-wing governments which have occupied the Executive House. The installation of this measure, like other identical ones, remains a dirigist: the State, through its competent emanations, regulates every detail of the lives of individuals, families and businesses and, in this case, even manages to classify and define tomato pastes. It is clear that, in doing so, the result will not be to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. Once again, the rationale behind the measures taken is wrong. If the attention is placed on what the public can and must do, it degrades the private, who in the meantime tries to make rational choices to continue with his entrepreneurial activity, to mere passive spectator to whom illogical and, above all, counterproductive demands are made. One of them, the most obvious because the most senseless in my opinion, is found in Article 13, where it is stated that the public authorities are obliged to collect data on persons engaged in agricultural activities electronically. But you imagine a farmer from the countryside of a small Italian country where he does not arrive, if not at who knows how many kilometers away, the Internet line? Do we not realize that regulatory hypertrophy, especially if conceived against the nature of things, contributes to the loss of competitiveness and certainly not to its improvement? It is also expected that financial assistance to support agricultural and fisheries enterprises will be provided through financial operations carried out by the Institute for the Development of Food and Agriculture SpA, on the basis of specific conditions which I leave out here; but the whole mechanism is subject to prior authorisation by the European Commission. So let us add to our bureaucracy the European bureaucracy, so it is certain that this structure of soft loans will not give any advantage to the sector\\'s economy. Instead, with the intention of giving real support, we had proposed exemption from VAT for small farmers. In addition, the provisions on fisheries and aquaculture provide for excessive constraints for operators, including the use of standard boxes to simplify - it is said - the operations relating to weighing and the use of the bar code to provide product information. Instead of simplifying, additional procedures are in place for the authorisation and sale of fishery and aquaculture products. In this respect, one of our amendments, which I signed, was intended to make it easier, rather than hindering, trade in fishery products by proposing the direct sale of such products, in line with the provisions of the draft law allowing direct sale of agricultural products. Finally, most of the provisions of the bill include delegations to the Government, so we will have to wait for the implementing decrees to verify the results achieved. For these reasons, on behalf of the Forza Italia Group, I am voting against this measure.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5933998227119446, 0.4066002070903778]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we listened to you with great interest and we would have liked it here a month ago, at the previous European Council, when we were also talking about a vaccination plan. Unfortunately, our proposal has not been accepted and we hope that it will become institutional practice to come to Parliament and involve it at the European Councils, also to give a sign of discontinuity with the previous Commission, which has progressively emptied it of certain powers and prerogatives with many acts. It has been a month since that European Council to date, unprecedented things have happened and, Mr President, it is time to go further. <p> Mr President-in-Office of the Council,Brothers of Italy are asking you to raise your voice in Europe and to do so in the management of vaccines. You must say clearly, because you can do so, that the impact of the variants has found European countries unprepared, despite the fact that the rate of contagion has long been known. In this climate of unpreparedness, the delayed prophylaxis campaign, which revealed the total and resounding failure of the European Union in the vaccination plan, was a short-circuit. The European Union has signed capestro contracts with pharmaceutical companies, which have not respected the timing and the number of doses to be delivered and, thanks to those absurd constraints, signed by Brussels, those same pharmaceutical companies have remained substantially unpunished compared to their failures. On this failure, like a cyclone, came the issue of AstraZeneca of March 10: the one just passed was therefore a very dense month. <p> Mr President, you can and must therefore tell Europe that you have enormous responsibilities in mismanaging vaccination plans and you must do so, because Europe is paying a very high price to the pandemic. The number of victims has already exceeded one million: this is 35.5% of the total number of deaths on the planet. In his last press conference, during the decree-law support, he mentioned a concept inspired by pragmatism also with regard to the export of vaccines by unfulfilled pharmaceutical companies. He also said more: if the EU's coordination does not work, we will do it another way; and if the EU does not allow it soon, we can do it. It almost implied that it could be opened to the evaluation of Sputnik. This pragmatism and decision-making autonomy, which today has called strategic autonomy, are fine: do it and you will agree with us. If Sputnik is a safe and effective vaccine, there is no trade war to hold. It should be evaluated and marketed immediately, as well as any other vaccine considered potentially useful to the Covid contrast. If the serum produced by Moscow's scientists, Mr President, can help win the pandemic, the European Union cannot refuse another potential remedy. We cannot afford this only because of geopolitical prejudice, because the interest of health and scientific interest must prevail. If Commissioner Breton says - as he did today - that he does not need it, you can easily say otherwise. In short, Mr President, I use the words of Giorgia Meloni in saying that the Italian Government must awaken from torpor and act in the exclusive national interest, intervening in Europe and, if necessary, moving on in its own way. No more delays and trade wars. Just waste a time that isn't there, while the virus accelerates and changes! We need a radical reversal of course. I'm coming to the vaccination plan now. You say today that we will vaccinate as many people as possible in the shortest possible time. Nothing to say: it is acceptable. The point, though, is numbers. If the pace is that of today, that is 158,000 doses, to reach 70 percent of Italians it takes over a year. And I'm not saying that. That cannot remain the rhythm. When you say, optimistically perhaps, that there might be two months late, I must think that every day late can mean 500 people dying. If I have to multiply this for two months, that means 30,000 people can die. And I don't want to do any more math, because they're not numbers, but they're people, and the responsibility is huge. So what's the plan? 500,000 injections a day in April and 700,000 in May? Well, you gotta get there. You have to get there and be ready. The plan prepared by General Son may function as a machine, but only if there are the necessary doses and if there is the audience to administer them, otherwise everything will fail. We need to develop a lot of things that we hear about but that we do not see put into a system. The vaccination campaign launched on December 27 then failed. You do not have direct and personal responsibilities for this, of course, but you know that this is part of the failed health policy put in place by the previous Commission, which sees Minister Hope as a sign of a left continuity, while it is of radical discontinuity that, even on this, Italy needs. Again, he asked the regions for a realignment. That is right, but if there is no precise indication at the central level, it is difficult to recall the regions. How come we have the paradox for which we see that the population over 80 has been vaccinated even for 30 percent of its total, when it is now clear that the virus affects 86 percent of elderly people. It's an inexplicable paradox, President Draghi. Again, the vaccination campaign started according to certain categories, while now, instead, for age groups: confusion and delays. And above all, you have forgotten, in stages 1 and 2, the categories of disabled people, fragile people, caregivers and their families. Today - fortunately - you remember it, and also thanks to an amendment by Brothers of Italy. Nothing can justify the chaos we have seen. Nothing will justify elderly people in line, assembled and perhaps brought by bus. Nothing can justify the delay in home care and the delay of unupdated protocols by the Ministry. Nothing at all. We have not only criticized: we have made a vaccination plan. Among other things, we see some proposals included and we are happy with them. This is a case where we're okay with just participating. Our vaccination plan included home care, enlargement of the vaccine audience, involving basic doctors and pharmacists. Even on pharmacists, however, you must hurry to make protocols, otherwise you will not be able to develop this system. You see, President Draghi, the point is also that, on the whole strategy of containing the pandemic, we see no signs of major discontinuity, because we are still here with the DAD, with closed schools, with closed restaurants, with vaccines that do not arrive. I am beginning to conclude, because I realize that my time is over. I'd love to talk about pharmaceutical reshoring, but I'll do it next time. President Draghi, the point is always one and it is always that: what posture to be in Europe. We continue to think that it is necessary to defend, in Europe, the national interest and to consider it to be pre-eminent. We will never be able to accept any transfer of national sovereignty, as you said in your communications on the day of the vote of confidence. Mr President, this is the moment when we have to be assertive and we cannot give in to anything. You look at Europe today from another position. His task and duty today is to think only of Italy and Italians.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6112789511680603, 0.3887210786342621]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Mr Zaffini (<PARTY>). Mr President, first of all, I welcome the Minister, whom we welcome to this House on the occasion of the first health measure, almost a year after his installation. This is certainly a measure of which the effort is appreciated, but definitely not the result. Yesterday, with a slightly colorful expression, I said that the measure would be renamed \"Saudi calabria\" because it takes into consideration a piece of country that seems not to exist as Italy and not there for many reasons. Firstly, after ten years of police management, with disastrous results to say the least (of which, obviously, you are not responsible, nor the current Government), we put hand to solutions that do not change anything compared to the economic system, as my colleague Errani would call it, but, indeed, in a combination of deadly disposition, add a criminalistic vision. In fact, it is established that a Commissioner is no longer enough, but two are needed, and that controllers of controllers are needed. These are rules which - it is not difficult to imagine - will further complicate an installation which has not solved the problem of the accounts, but - indeed - has aggravated them and, above all, has resulted in a gap of more than five years in life expectancy (of which you, Minister, are perfectly aware). 40 years after the launch of the National Health Service and ten years after the first commissioning of an Italian State Region, such as Calabria, we still do not solve the problem and condemn the Calabrian citizens to a five-year deficit in life expectancy. This is not a civilized nation, from Italy. I repeat, it\\'s from \"Saudi calabria\" (Saudi calabria). All this could not be dealt with in such a superficial measure and, as I called it yesterday, graceful. This is disconcerting, Minister. There are fifteen articles on issues which actually represent four reforms. In fact, it is four reforms that we are talking about: the Calabrian police system; the medical and health professions; the Italian drug agency; some measures concerning judicial and accounting procedures. With a handful of articles we put the problem back in a way that - I repeat - is largely worrying, almost disconcerting, without acting on the causes, but only with an aspirin that cures the effects. For example, on the issue of the medical professions, starting from the analysis, which is now widely shared, of the shortage of specialist doctors, but not only, because there are also second-level medical professionals, there are three emergency levels. The first is that of access to university, the second is that of the availability of specialized doctors, the third is the need to make better available and more rationally used the current staff. You are acting on the third level, but you are doing so on a fast and worrying basis in some respects, for example, emergency doctors and general medical doctors. It acts like this, tearing, without predicting, without foreordaining solutions that put their hands on the causes. We have taken the example of scholarships: the rapporteur has explained the availability of an additional number of scholarships, but here we need a revolution, Minister. Mr Sileri, do not distract me from the Minister, because he is never here, so today I want it all for myself. We need something revolutionary, we need a vision. I have been on the other side for a lifetime compared to my colleague Errani, and I am totally embarrassed to have to share what he says, but we need a vision, Minister. Today you, having no responsibility for what happened in the Calabria Region, nor for what happens in the National Health Service in general, have the great opportunity, which also constitutes an obligation, to have a vision, to revolutionize a plant that no longer works, to give important signals. On the availability of specialization schools, for example, as I said yesterday, why not give the possibility to the pharmaceutical multinationals, to whom we have contracted research - which is far more serious - to pay a number of scholarships for the training of specialist doctors? Why not? What\\'s the matter? If money is the problem, why not open up to these new forms of collaboration? There is much more to consider. What, then, Minister? We have finally dealt with the subject, but we are dealing with it for eighteen months, that is, for a fixed time and only in the part that concerns the effects and with some palliative measures, so we are very concerned because we believe that in reality this vision is not there. We believe that in reality the logic of the condominium administrator prevails over the logic of those who govern a phenomenon: today there is need for everything in health except for a condominium administrator. You see, Minister, this year we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the National Health Service. You know better than I do, because you have confidential data, that this system as it is on the last lap, the bell is ringed, it will not hold longer than the next two, three or four years. Perhaps we will celebrate the 42nd or 43rd anniversary, but we will certainly not celebrate the 45th or 50th anniversary of the National Health Service as it is. It is therefore necessary, for a whole series of reasons, to look carefully, even outside the National Health Service (the society that evolves, the chronicization of diseases, the lengthening of average life), a requirement that you, Minister, have a great responsibility, which is to foreshadow an opening, a vision. I repeat, for example, that the second pillar must be structured. All advanced economies have done so, France and the United Kingdom have done so in Europe. We\\'re very late. I compare idiosyncrasia against the private with the old master-worker diatribe. Enough, let\\'s get past these mental blocks. We open up to a new health service and start with these measures to give the image of a vision, if any. But I have the reasonable suspicion that it is not there: if there is, Minister, show us and show us. In this measure the vision is not there and there is not even the solution of the problems of the Calabria Region. We also believe that there are serious and important aspects of unconstitutionality, and it is no coincidence that we voted in favour of both prejudices.

I believe that, also because of the recent judgment of the Constitutional Court, it is appropriate to reflect on the direction that this House must give, within a measure, which - alas - will already cause a great deal of damage in other cases. With this decree-law, and in particular with Article 2, we are certainly not setting a good example for the younger generations. We are inviting the younger generations to embark on paths that will certainly cause problems for our society as a whole. I believe that, in order to prevent certain phenomena, this is not the way to go: prevention must try to support all the initiatives that go in the direction of suppressing those phenomena that, like drug dealing, damage the social fabric of our communities. I also say this because we all know the commitment that the Forces of Order put, daily, in trying to repress these crimes, in pursuing their authors, also in the light of the business that international crime carries out on the skin of our young people and of all the components of society. Therefore, if, within this measure which we do not share, there is precisely one case that is regulated in our opinion in the wrong way, it is precisely that brought by Article 2, for its cultural, ethical and moral message. I am referring to the fact that we can accept and liberalise everything. Basically we surrender to a reality that, on the contrary, should be fought in the right ways. I do not think that we can serve only the policies of repression, the hard and rigid ones, but certainly not even a laxist policy, a sort of laissez-faire.

It is the story of a six-year-old girl who, after a very short time from her birth, was taken away from the care of her parents, entrusted to social services and then to the care of a family. Meanwhile, with regard to her natural parents, due to their age of age - an age actually advanced in an unusual way compared to that in which they normally conceive their children and because of which, in 2010, when the child was born, there was also a particular media attention - the courts (first the Court of Appeal of Turin and then the Court of Cassation) had issued a measure that definitively took this child away from the care of its natural parents, declaring its adoption. What is striking is that, at the basis of these judgments, there was the presumption of an act of abandonment by the parents themselves against the child. Well, despite the subsequent intervention, on this presumption of abandonment, a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Turin, which instead completely exonerated the parents from this hypothesis of crime, the Court of Cassation, in 2013, reiterated to this family the unreliability to carry out its parental task and decreed again the adoption of the child. Through an application for revocation, last week the Court of Cassation itself determined instead that the adoption cannot be ruled and that the child, even in the light of the further checks made on the social, cultural and moral characteristics of the parents, can be re-relied to the care of the family itself, referring the decision adopted by the Court of Cassation itself to the examination of the Court of Appeal of Turin. Of course, I have neither the legal instruments nor the psychological or sociological instruments to express an assessment that has been made on the subject. Of course, in this affair they leave many elements of discrepancy and even of obvious antinomy between the first judgment of the Court of Cassation - which, in relation to these parents, spoke of total untrustworthyness and presumption of omnipotence for having chosen to have a child despite the advanced age - and today's sentence, which instead says that those parents are decent people and absolutely suitable to carry out their parental task.

The procedures provided for in the Constitution, the laws and the Regulations serve, in our bicameral system, precisely this, that is to avoid these bad mistakes and these nasty figures that, then, are reflected on the image not of the Government, but of our country abroad. But can you imagine what an international investor who, due to his misfortune, was sitting here today in the Senate in front of an executive who, forty-eight hours after the provisional exercise, was wrong in the accounts of the financial maneuver? <p> Mr President, this is an unprecedented fact and an unprecedented gravity, because it is not so much about the substance, but rather about the faceliness and superficiality with which all this has been dealt with. The haste is the result of your divisions, your quarrels and blackmail within the majority. I remember that to call scandalous the method by which the Senate was imposed this timing are not Luca Ciriani of Brothers of Italy or colleagues of Forza Italia or of the League, but it was Senator Renzi no later than twenty-four hours ago. If it's scandalous for him, it certainly is for us, too. Forty-eight hours after the provisional exercise, which would be a tragedy not for the government, but for families, citizens and businesses, the Commission announces that it must still cut, sew, add, rethink and review. That is enough. We have reached a moment and a point beyond which the institutions cannot be trampled underfoot.

Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to stigmatise an event which once again leaves a lot of surprise, as it were. I have repeatedly had the opportunity to reiterate in this House how often the philosophy of linear cuts really makes disasters much more serious than those problems that it would like to solve. I refer to the court in Modica, whose closure I tried to involve many of our senators, who along with me came to the city of Modica to see what is being done with this act aimed at closing a court that was inaugurated a few years ago and that cost only EUR 12 million. All this to save and concentrate judicial activity in the nearby capital, the city of Ragusa. Well, now (and that is why I am speaking, because I have asked the Commission for justice, I have asked questions, colleagues have come to Modica and have realized the quality and efficiency from all points of view of a new and safe structure) from the capital city, which should welcome its own court and that of the nearby city of Modica, they ask the competent Ministry of funds, the money in order to be able to make an adequate structure to accommodate the court of Ragusa and that of Modica. So I would like to ask the House (and, of course, the Government, which is unfortunately not present, but I will ask a question tomorrow morning) what the ratio is, where the savings stand. We close a court that we have just inaugurated, cost 12 million euros, and we ask for more money from the Ministry to go and strengthen structures that of course cannot be adequate to accommodate all the work that concerns both courts. All this involves an increase in spending, a disservice, a procrastinate again over the years the answers that are already very slow, unfortunately.

Although the measure is precisely called a thousandprorogations, it does not only contain extensions of deadlines because the tasks have not been done, but also measures are decided useful for citizens, such as the 120-day extension for those who have been evicted; the delay in setting the criteria for using the CAF in an appropriate way; the introduction of delays in the submission of the application to the INPS, with reference in particular to the case of the rules on pension treatment for workers exposed to asbestos: these are measures that citizens expect, it is not the Government that wants to impose its own roadmap. <p> There are measures on emergencies and we know that the problems of Emilia-Romagna and L'Aquila are still open and require further extensions for the acts concerning them. <p> There are also work interventions, tax incentives aimed at the return of the worker to Italy, for example, or provisions on the tax regime for youth entrepreneurship and mobile workers: these are certainly measures and extensions expected. <p> Then there is the whole game related to the relations between the State, local authorities, Provinces and Regions: in these years of great transformations, there have certainly been flaws on our part, with difficulties and organizational jams, but certainly the local authorities are still waiting for many measures. To name one of the most important ones for the moment we are living, there is the extension to 2017 of the participation to 100% of the contrast to the escape for the Municipalities: it is an important point that has been requested just for the activities of contrast to the escape to be more effective. <p> Another important element is the extension of single purchasing power stations. The municipalities, especially the smaller ones (because this measure concerns the municipalities not the provincial capital), asked first of all for a single deadline, because two different deadlines were foreseen, one for the acquisition of goods and services and another for public works: the deadline was unified on 1 September 2015, mainly helping the smaller municipalities, because they have not managed in recent months to adapt to this legislation and above all to join, compared to all the organizational problems, giving rise to the associated forms of municipalities. <p> The interventions on the regions, which are once again the subject of many problems during this period, also concern the vertical stability pact, which, as you know, allows local authorities to take advantage of a part of the Region's Stability Pact. <p> Finally, the Provinces, which as we know are a painful key at the moment: there are many difficulties they face and everyone was waiting, for example, for a word about employment centres. The fact that we have an extension on employment centres is crucial. <p> I am still making two comments. <p> One concerns the 2006 Olympic Games, on which I was stimulated by previous interventions. I am sorry for Senator Fucksia, but this is an absolutely indispensable extension in order not to lose money to all those who currently have an open dispute. In fact, the agency's remaining activities mainly concern the definition of outstanding disputes which will then allow the use of the remaining resources. Resources that amounted to about €40 million. <p> This also allows the execution of extraordinary maintenance and redevelopment of the plants located in the mountain territories affected by the Games. This may not be known only by those who do not know what the revolution of the Olympic Games has meant for certain small mountain territories, where very large installations have been installed which have required a very complex conversion activity. <p> Allow me, Mr President, to address a small joke to Senator Comaroli, who has complained a great deal about the extensions. And in part I share his irritation because I also think that the thousand-pronged decrees must be disposed of and reduced in size over the years. I wonder, however, why she did not complain about Article 4 (3) which provides for the extension of the use of resources available on the special accounts of the Provinces of Monza and Brianza, which are intended for the establishment of the peripheral offices of the State administration, resources allocated to the special accounts established by the Commissioner of each Province and then transferred to the prefects responsible for completing the interventions.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7019780874252319, 0.29802191257476807]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Government, I confess a real emotion also because its authority and competence are intimidating. It is not the first speech I make in this House, but probably the narcissism of those who preceded it did not arouse any awe. Mr President, I would like to extend my greetings to you. <p> Mr President, by quoting our head of department, Mr Bitonci, the Plan only works if reforms are dealt with, starting with cutting red tape, for example. With 400 billion less turnover, a decline in GDP of around 9%, simplification and cutting red tape are key to recovery.

We have always put trust in Italians, especially when we talk about reopenings. We agree when he talks about relaunching tourism and when Minister Garavaglia finally unlocks 350 million euros for the tour operator sector, travel agencies and fairs. <p> Curfew at 10 p.m. is not acceptable. I think it's clear to everyone now. The risk we have run - I hope I can speak in the past - is that 50% of the air routes to Italy with this curfew will be diverted elsewhere for obvious reasons. Having to go home at 22, while in other countries you can still enjoy the summer, it doesn't help us. If the fear of gathering after 10 p.m. for bars and restaurants is a problem and gives cause for concern, let me tell you something: Mr President, today I did Genoa-Rome in a full airplane without space. <p> To the proposal of someone who wants to launch the fashion of sunbathing with the mask, I answer provocatively: we jogging with the ski suit. Speaking of the superbonus, everyone calls for an extension to 2023. At the same time, we are very concerned about conditionality in order to achieve this extension. Mr President, you yourself said that with the combination of the extension with cross-compliance and the absence of simplifications, which we have asked for and had included in the recovery, there is a risk that the sector will be blocked. The effectiveness of this measure is what we play on simplification. It doesn't rain. The grounding of this measure goes through simplification and, of course, in 2023 we risk blocking investment from this point of view. <p> Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to a subject that is dear to me, which we wanted to put across. I do not know if there is Senator Croatti - I put on the glasses so I see him - that with me he did a battle for the tourist guides, who finally and fortunately ask for a reform of their situation, also because they are, perhaps, those who have suffered the most difficult moment resulting from this pandemic in the tourism sector. If you want to meet this challenge with Mr Garavaglia, Mr President, we will be there. I will finish because there is not much time. <p> The recovery plan obviously cannot be the solution to all the problems, especially if it is not accompanied by the reforms that everyone expects. But it is certainly an extraordinary opportunity. In the reform that Europe is asking us about gender equality, social rights and sustainability, Europe and above all you, Mr President, defend us from those countries that compete with our continent, that these rules do not respect them.

Madam President, Minister, Mrs Undersecretary, ladies and gentlemen, this is a measure which we all looked forward to and perhaps, naively, we hoped to be able to contribute to its drafting. Unfortunately, the Gentiloni Government acts in continuity with the previous one, resetting our work in the relevant Commissions and rejecting all the amendments tabled. The Gentiloni-Renzi Government and the majority party have emphasized, in recent days, the introduction in Italy of a measure against poverty. It is the income of inclusion which, according to the intentions of the majority, should be the decisive measure to address this social condition. The resources made available to respond to the economic difficulties of millions of people, who are poor or at risk of poverty, are €600 million for the first year and €1 billion for the second year (2017). These figures are ridiculous and I do not understand how they can be hailed as a measure against poverty. There have been a number of loans for banks and to protect those responsible for the disasters that have occurred on the shoulders of thousands of savers: this comparison makes it possible to clearly determine where the government's greatest attention is actually being paid. Therefore, the umpteenth law of delegation is proposed: it is a broad delegation, a blank bill of exchange that, in order to be implemented, requires the adoption, within six months, of numerous legislative decrees for: the introduction of a national measure to combat poverty, understood as being impossible to have all the goods and services necessary to lead a decent standard of living, and social exclusion (this measure, called income of inclusion, is identified as an essential level of benefits to be guaranteed uniformly throughout the national territory); the reorganization of the benefits of a welfare nature, aimed at the fight against poverty, except for the benefits addressed to the elderly population, no longer of working age, for the benefits in support of parenthood and for those related to the condition of disability and disability of the beneficiary; the strengthening of the coordination of social services interventions, in order to guarantee throughout the national territory the essential levels of benefits, within the principles of law 8 November 2000, n. 328. Luckily, the attempt to lay hands on social pensions and survivors has been blocked in the bud, but - as mentioned earlier - this is a Government of Robin Hood on the contrary: it takes away the poor to give to bankers. Drafting legislative decrees is certainly not an easy task, but I hope that it can be dealt with by the Government with due attention, perhaps drawing from the many propositive interventions of the oppositions expressed in these days in the Commission, as in the Assembly. Unfortunately, however, given the acceleration given to the measure in recent weeks, I fear that legislative decrees will come out very similar to campaign slides. Since the beginning of the crisis, people in absolute poverty in Italy have increased by 155%: in 2007 there were 1.8 million, while today there are 4.6 million. Behind the numbers are the faces and stories of hundreds of thousands of families; to these people we are not able to give an overall answer. They are people who have lost their jobs or have fallen into discomfort because of problems related to ludopathy, drugs, alcohol or simply because they have faced a separation that is not consensual; they are men and women who struggle every day to regain their dignity. A State worthy of this name should take care of these Italians, complying with what our Constitution states in Article 3. For us, the aim is to provide concrete answers to poverty, not through welfare, but through the creation of real job opportunities that can contribute to the development and growth of our country. The delegation law does not allocate additional resources to support the measures indicated, in addition to those already provided for in the Stability Act. Any additional resources will have to be found by the competent administrations (so, Ministry of Labour and local authorities) through a different allocation of ordinary human, financial and instrumental resources, to the state of endowment to the same administrations. It is reported a few days ago that more than 22.3 percent of tax revenue comes from the boom of games collections. In fact, it is EUR 2.5 billion more. Could they not be made available to this bill? On the other hand, once again, local authorities are being asked for efforts after a season of cuts that has no equal in the history of the Republic. What can I say? This is a left that has abandoned the unions, the teachers, the workers, the disabled who have put in great difficulty with the reform of the ISEE. The measure today in approval provides multidisciplinary teams that will have to evaluate application by application, person per person the audience of the applicants of the benefits granted by this law. I make an estimate: in ten years there will still be users waiting for evaluation. Was it not better to use the social services of the municipalities perhaps transferring dedicated resources to this purpose? Furthermore, who will be monitoring the beneficiary persons? Do you really think that those who live the problem of ludopathy, drug addiction, alcoholism will go looking for a job and that the contribution they will receive will spend it for noble reasons? Attention, I would like to avoid any possible doubt: we are not opposed to the establishment of income support policies, but we would have liked to confront each other with something concrete. Senator Parente, we would have appreciated a majority able to discuss, to confront ourselves, perhaps giving us the opportunity to actively contribute to the drafting of the bill. Poverty is a problem for all. It hits cross-cuttingly. There are no preconstituted truths and, much less, holders of the truth. Dear colleagues in the majority, make it clear: no one has absolute truth, much less you. The blank bills almost no longer sign them; only blackmailers, blackmailers and fools remain to do so. You will always find us ready when you have humility, but above all the courage to confront you on ideas and not on sadly white sheets. Do not continue to say that this is a historical measure because in history it will enter us for having again mocked the Italians. I conclude with a thought that I hope will open hearts and minds, a thought that I hope will help to reflect on the task that we are here to carry out. Care is a creative act; it is a gesture that changes the existing creating beauty. It is a revolutionary act that changes the gray flow of things with the colors of attention, listening and love. It is, like art, unique, unrepeatable, engraved in history and space; and, like art, it is a fully human need.

Last year, in this House, I asked the institutions for a sign of concrete respect for this infinite pain, for those white tombstones that, aligned in the monumental cemetery of Fortogna, in the Longaronese, lead us to the endless list of names of men, women and children carved inside the chapel. For that cemetery I had requested the recognition of an annual contribution, presenting an amendment to the law of stability, necessary to preserve with the dignity and respect due the memory of our deaths to the survivors who still mourn them. The amendment, however, was, as always, unfortunately not considered. I will return to it, because the government must fill its absence, it must have a minimum of respect for my people: 1,910 people died, of which the majority in the municipalities of Longarone, Codissago, Castellavazzo, Erto and Casso and 200 from other municipalities in Belluno. I do not want to make controversy, but, last year, on the 50th anniversary, in words, the representatives of the institutions present at the official celebrations, from President Grasso, to the former President of the Council Letta (but I also address the current President of the Council Renzi), had given their willingness to find the resources, few, requested, but still nothing to date. Not even the invitation to the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano to go to honor the places of memory, in order to bring those excuses that still too few have felt the duty to express today, has been answered. I turn to the institutions, to those who represent them, with that force of silent pain that distinguishes us mountain people: do not forget, do not forget us, and have respect for those who have suffered this enormous tragedy and injustice because you no longer have to feel that sense of shame that at present too many have yet to endure.

A document which, since 2003, has been an integral part of the more general economic and financial planning act, as provided for in Article 1 of the Target Law, as provided for in Article 10 of the Law of Accounting and Public Finance, and as most recently confirmed by the law of coordination of the economic policies of the Member States. <p> Nevertheless, the drafting and examination of this measure for a long time translates substantially into a mere and formal bureaucratic fulfillment: a sort, in short, of computer report on the state of progress of the works about the great works that over the years have had different levels of approval, financing and realization, and on which it is not always easy to understand logic and rationality in a programming framework that would instead be ordered and certain. The investment expenditure, and in particular that dedicated to the planning of the interventions aimed at the infrastructural endowment of the Country, should represent the essential program of development that a Country manages to give itself and coherently to pursue. It is clear that, in the given temporal context, the Document at our examination is clearly and inevitably affected by the approach given by the previous government rather than by the one currently in office. The first observation, then, is to ask the new Government, and in particular the competent Minister, to deal carefully for the future, with due care and rigour, with the task that the law provides and assigns to it. Serious planning is not an abstract exercise, a book of dreams in which to understand all the more or less legitimate demands that come from the different territories of the country due to an alleged or real state of deficit or infrastructural backwardness; but it is not even the absence of any programming of priorities, as the objective law has deliberately constituted in these ten years. In the past in fact it has been acquitted, from the successive Governments, to a function of substantial uncritical acceptance of the state of the needs coming from the territories, often with agreements of program State-Regions free from all logic of sustainability and financial coverage, until in this way to raise the Plan of strategic infrastructures, as estimated from the 7th report on the implementation of the objective law, to an amount of approximately 375 billion euros for the 390 planned works. The time has come to take note of the inadequacy of the objective law to correspond to the actual needs of the infrastructure issue in this decade and to which it has not been able to fulfil in terms of the selection of priorities, speed in the procedures of approval and financing and certainty in terms of financial availability. The data contained in the report of the attached infrastructure are eloquent: if you go from the universe of 390 works included in the <PARTY>S to the value of the 190 works of the CIPE perimeter, that is those approved at least once by that body, with preliminary draft or final plan and attached financial framework, the estimated cost is reduced to 142,5 billion euros, pairs only to 38 percent of the cost of the entire program, regarding which the resources available amount to only 78,3 billion euros, that allow a financial coverage pairs to 55 percent of the estimated cost. But the works actually carried out and completed in the most recent decade of studies claim to be just 4% and estimate new resources for the coming years in no more than four or five billion actual. In the face of this picture, I believe that the government must then put a more serious hand in planning worthy of this name: it is necessary, all the more, in the economic conditions that the country goes through. This means clarifying, once and for all, the actual financial resources for the coming years and those actually available already now, because it is only because of these that it will be possible to scale priorities and types of implementation. In conclusion, and softly, some indications that may be useful for the future that we face. This government has a year to prepare a serious attached infrastructure dimensioned on the resources actually available: don't waste it! Circulated the perimeter of the resources, it defines according to the communitarian priorities - the infrastructures included within the framework of the core network - those necessary priorities that correspond for our country to the short and medium term objectives for its urgent infrastructural modernization. Probably it will be discovered that the season of the great works will have to be momentarily set aside waiting for better economic periods and that instead it is urgent to complete, with infrastructures of connection and upgrade, those that are our natural doors of access for the goods and passengers, that is to say the ports and the airports and their connection with the main railway arteries and highways. It will be discovered, perhaps, that probably the works and the participations necessary to throw again of the logistics in our Country, determining factor for our economy, not only they do not need important resources for pharaonic interventions, but that often with few hundreds of million they will be able to solve dramatic problems of congestedness, that in these years they have wasted time (and therefore money), but also important opportunities of development. Probably, if we have the courage to pursue this logic, we will discover that these will be works that will pay for themselves, thanks to the improvement of the conditions and economic repercussions that will produce on those territories and that the only not making them determines a cost now unbearable for the collectives. In short, I wish this strange government and this strange majority that supports it, which is not given the opportunity to fail if we want policy to repair the damage that has been done in recent years and regain the necessary credibility, a sort of Copernican infrastructure revolution. Much can be done with little, as long as it really is done and as long as it is done soon. We have just one year, not for the launch of a few unlikely great works, but for a plan of many small but realistic works, able to put in a few years the wings to the country, to give work to thousands of technicians and workers and to improve in fact the economic conditions of our industrial realities and the living conditions of our urban centers. It is only by giving confidence to the potential present on the territories that we can overcome the difficult challenge facing us: that of a crisis that seems to give us no breath. We must do this above all for the passion and tenacity that every day millions of Italians put into the business of their companies, in order to ensure that Italy is not a wretched geographical condition, but the most beautiful and important trademark that we all have available.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5309780836105347, 0.46902191638946533]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> I would warn colleagues who are following us, either for video or audio, that this is the last explanation of vote, and then we will proceed to the call on the question of trust. <p> Martini (<PARTY>). Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote for confidence and for the measure we are considering. It will do so for the reasons of substance and analysis which have been proposed here and also for the merit of the content indicated in the report by my colleague Mr Pagliari, whom I thank for his work. As far as we are concerned, I want to do so with the arguments that my colleagues supported in the debate, both here in the Senate (I am referring to my colleagues Albano, Favero and Mirabelli), and to the House in recent weeks. I will not retrace them all, of course, for brevity and also because I think they are known, but I will highlight only the salient points. The decree-law clearly defined the concept of public security for the first time. Urban security therefore becomes a public good, closely linked to the improvement of the quality of life of cities. It may seem a subject that is perhaps too general for those who lose a little in the details of things, but I think it is a political point not to be lost. Steps to take are also indicated and are part of the security: social and cultural urban qualification, the recovery of degraded areas, the promotion of the culture of legality. We have an agenda that supports the concept of security as a public good. Secondly, there is an increased and more detailed role of the mayors and municipalities and more laxly of the autonomy, beyond the rhetoric about the mayors sheriffs. They will be able to intervene more effectively on the degradation, on the times of sale and administration of alcohol and on the times of the games rooms. It is, however, a contribution to improving the quality of cities. We have greater clarification of the competences of the State-City relationship and the institutional set-up of the Security Government is being improved. This is an issue that we should be very interested in, since we have often complained about the uncertainty of competences and the overlapping of roles: the State deals with public order and security, Regions and Municipalities make agreements with the State for integrated security. It's definitely a positive work trace. The role of local police in integrated security is recognised: not a B-series police, but a crucial structure because it knows the territory and has daily relations with citizens. The fair compensation and reimbursement of hospital expenses for reasons of service that were eliminated in 2011 are restored. Municipalities with budgets in order can hire local police officers. It is a contribution that can be made. Finally, there are new instruments of prevention and repression: administrative sanctions, such as the removal of those who prevent the use of public places, parking spaces and abusive traders, and to protect important areas socially and economically. Measures are also provided against alcohol abuse and vandalism and the delayed arrest that allows the Forces of the Order to work better is restored. On the basis of these content - which I acknowledge to Minister Minniti and to the Government - I would like to make three general considerations in order to conclude my statement. The first is this: there is an effort to link prevention and repression better. These are two elements to keep together all the time. We do not want the logic of fear to prevail, irresponsibly fueled by too many political, social, communicative and informative subjects, because it leads nowhere and does not allow us to intervene on the causes of the problems we face. The problem of security is not solved by the infinite tightening of penalties, by the creation of walls and barriers, nor by private self-defense, even if armed. Intelligent action is needed that combines prevention and repression and the security pacts will include inclusion, social solidarity and the fight against marginality. I know that many people say that these are words that will not follow, but they are a political and institutional commitment that will win us and call us all to responsibility. It is a new field on which it is worth working with conviction and it is thanks to the decree-law in question to have re-proposed it forcefully. <p> (Follows Martini). Secondly, we return to talking more carefully about the outskirts: this is an important issue and it cannot be a matter of fashion or that is raised only by the analysts of the electoral results and the various referendums. I am referring to the subject of the peripheries intended both geographically and socially. Today most people live in the outskirts, even in the big cities, while those who live in the historic centers are the large minority of the same metropolis; many people feel themselves suburban anyway. This is the result of the growth of social inequalities and also of the iniquities present in the same economic development. I believe that having put this issue back at the centre of the debate is a political contribution that we cannot underestimate. Finally, there is the theme of the relationship between the State and the Municipalities, between the State and the Regions, between the State and the self-government. It is an important point of general value. We come from a phase in which the theme of the relationship between center and autonomy has often been lived as a divisive, for example in the debate on Title V in constitutional reform. Now we know that a contrast, a distance between state and self-government is not necessary either on security or on everything else. We therefore take the opportunity offered by this decree-law to relaunch the prospect of serious, effective and cooperative self-government and we oppose the culture of centralization at all costs, which produces neither savings nor better efficiency of the State. To conclude, Mr President, I think that this is a commitment that deserves support and continuous work.

Discussing and remembering in particular days, I thought that everyone in life should make that journey at least once in life, possibly as a young person, to truly understand, as far as possible, the tragedy of the Holocaust and the Shoah. <p> For this reason, precisely on Memory Day, January 27, with Senator Rivolta and Senator Romeo we filed a bill that goes in the same direction as the motion that followed, with which we propose to encourage the journeys of memory for high school students so that as many young people as possible can do so. <p> To do this, of course, we need funds. In the draft law presented we hypothesized a figure of 5 million euros per year, but to be included as a structural measure within the law of 2000 that established the Day of Memory. These funds are certainly not sufficient, but they are a step forward in ensuring that more students than today can travel to concentration and extermination camps. <p> I would be very pleased if, in addition to the motion we are debating today, all the Members present would sign this bill, working with us to improve the text and perhaps persuade the Government to commit more than EUR 5 million. <p> For years we know that the Ministry of Education, University and Research collaborates with the Union of Italian Jewish Communities on a project called \"Young people remember the Shoah\" which includes a competition in which, however, only a part of the Italian schools participates. <p> Sorry, colleagues, I\\'m talking about the Shoah. <p> Maybe you have more important things to do, I don\\'t know. We\\'re talking about the Shoah. I ask for some respect, and not for me. <p> <PARTY>ROVANO (<PARTY>). Thank you, Mr President. As I said, this is an annual contribution of a few hundred thousand euros to reward students participating in the competition and that guarantees every year, in addition to initiatives promoted independently by schools, a trip to concentration camps and places of memory, but only to a hundred students. We want to ensure much more travel for students in this country, so that everyone can do so at least once in their own course of study. I knew about the Shoah since I was a kid, because I was lucky enough to have a mom at home watching all the documentaries and movies on the subject. When I grew up, I studied and studied, but until I was in Mauthausen, the Shoah and the Holocaust, I knew nothing. I\\'ve forgotten a lot of things I\\'ve studied over the years, and I have vague memories of that school trip to Austria. I remember a glimpse of Salzburg, the beautiful Butterfly House in Vienna, a Sacher cake that I brought home to my parents and the beautiful paintings of Klimt at Belvedere. I have vague memories and images imprinted in my mind. But of the day at the Mauthausen concentration camp I have never forgotten and will never forget a single image. It was cold, it was snowy, but I had clothes. It was a horrible place. I felt like I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could, and I knew I\\'d get out of there. We went for a ride in the courtyards, the shacks, the crematoria ovens and the small gas chamber. Yes, because Mauthausen was a fake concentration camp: there were no large gas chambers like maybe in Auschwitz, because the extermination took place in another way, especially through forced labor in the nearby granite quarry. Not only that: the extermination of the deportees took place through death sentences for inedia, hunger and thirst in the blockades of death. It provoked the eviction of stone bearers on the ladder of death, in the precipice of the quarry; the prisoners were pushed from the cliff, called the wall of the parachutists, and the suicides were led by despair. There were blows of axe or of white weapons on crowds of deportees; beatings, lashes, tortures, stranglements and beatings by the dogs of the SS; suppression of almost all the sick, with injections to the heart; introduction in the crematories of living subjects; forced drownings in buckets of water or in the sewer; suicides for a quick and gentle death, through the barbed wire electrified; blows of revolver to the nape during false measurements of the height; moving gas chambers, through a truck with the exhaust pipe turned inside the rear compartment of the vehicle; jet of ice-cream hydrants in winter, on naked prisoners, throughout the night; mass shots; promiscuity in environments without hygiene with carriers of serious infectious diseases; death due to the overly light clothing; medical experiments on human guinea pigs. Then I remember the picking of raspberries: the macabre charade to equip the prisoners with baskets and force them to collect raspberries, which were outside the electric grids of the camp, followed by the shooting by the sentries for attempted escape. I remember, again, the bleeding for transfusions to German soldiers on the eastern front; the lethal injections in the heart, with phenol, gasoline or other poisonous substances; the hangings and the self-hangings commanded; extermination with deliberately low-calorie diet and poor for heavy work, specially designed to last a few months the deportee. About 200,000 people, of different nationalities, were deported to Mauthausen: from political opponents to people persecuted for religious reasons, to homosexuals, Jews, gypsies, prisoners of war and common criminals and half of the deportees were killed or found dead due to inhuman living and working conditions. At the end of the tour in the field, really difficult, my comrades and I were taken to a room where they showed us the original footage of the time, shot in particular by the Allied forces, by the Americans, who freed the camp and showed what the condition was when they arrived. I was there, right there, where all this happened. When I came out of the field that, as the bus went away, I saw him shrinking on the horizon, I cried like a child, because I was sad, but above all I was really very angry. I was there, maybe 25 years ago or something, and I\\'m here today. I was lucky enough to be elected to the Senate, I am a member of the institutions and - as has happened to me and to you, colleagues - today\\'s young people will be one tomorrow on these benches or in important places for the public life of the country. In illustrating this motion today, I represent a small piece of memory, which will have to be added to other pieces of a puzzle that will never be complete. The present motion and the bill related to it were filed before the worrying data of the Eurispes came out, referring to last year, 2019, according to which 15.6 percent of the Italian people deny that the Shoah ever existed, or does not know its existence: it is probably a mixture of the two things. This is alarming because, if we think that the figure was 2.7 in 2004, we are not going in the right direction. I also remember that our commitment is important, but it is not necessary to have a public role to make a difference, to fight anti-Semitism and all forms of discrimination based on race, skin color, sexual orientation and religious belief. I would like to remember not only the nearly six million Jews who died in the Shoah, but also the 27,362 Righteous among the nations, of which 714 are Italians, because they are proof that then something could be done and that the individual can make a difference. <p> Adding one plus one, plus one, plus one, and so on, you get to 27.362, and it\\'s an unofficial data because so many are not known. I looked for a fact that I did not find yesterday: how many Jews were saved by the Righteous, known and unknown? How many would have been added to those six million if individual people hadn\\'t helped them? Today I\\'m wearing a yellow shirt - as you can see - for two reasons: first, I thought of a beautiful message that sent the senator Segre - I\\'m sorry she couldn\\'t be here today in the days of the commemoration of the Shoah - with which she remembered a drawing made by a girl of Terezin: a yellow butterfly flying over a barbed wire. Senator Segre said she was like the yellow butterfly flying over the barbed wires. This we, the men of the institutions, should do: fly high, at least when we deal with such important issues, without manipulations, without retro thoughts, above all our differences. <p> The second reason is that this shirt belonged to my mom, and she packed it herself. My mom was an artist in work and life. You taught me the difference between right and wrong, not to be right or left. He taught me to treat people with respect, regardless of whether they were a king or the humblest person I met on my way. He taught me never to accept anything that I felt was profoundly wrong, neither out of fear, nor out of convenience. He taught me to always defend the weakest because - he told me - if I did not do it, maybe no one else would. <p> Honour to the Righteous, yesterday, today and tomorrow.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5444927215576172, 0.4555072784423828]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, representative of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss the draft law for the conversion of Decree-Law No 22 of 25 March 2019, which contains urgent measures to ensure security, financial stability and integrity of the markets, as well as the protection of the health and freedom of residence of Italian citizens and those of the United Kingdom, in the event of the withdrawal of the latter from the European Union. <p> We have said this on several occasions both as a parliamentary majority and as a government: Italy will be ready if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. We have kept our promise, and I thank the members of the Government involved and my colleagues in the Commission for their valuable work. The search for stability, protection and security of Italian interests remains for us the central objective of our political action. <p> I should like briefly to explain the content of this measure, which introduces, as I said, urgent measures to ensure financial stability and market integrity and aims to strengthen the protection of depositors, investors and policyholders, in the light of the rapid evolution of the international environment and the situation in the United Kingdom. The Decree-Law, in particular, contains provisions governing various specific areas, such as the exercise of special powers in areas of strategic importance, measures aimed at regulating the consequences of the possible withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and, last but not least, the maintenance, with some necessary modifications, of the scheme for granting the State guarantee on the securitisation of suffering. The measure was originally made up of 24 articles, then supplemented by a number of amendments introduced during the Commission's work, which improved the text under consideration. <p> The first part of the measure contains provisions on those special powers relating to 5G technology-based broadband electronic communications services. They are included among the activities of strategic importance, and therefore subject to the government's golden power, broadband electronic communications services based on 5G technology. An important change, which takes into account the evolution of the international context (and this is the reason for the inclusion in this decree-law) that protects the integrity and security of the networks and data passing through it, recognizing the strategic importance of this sector. The second part of the measure deals with a number of measures to ensure financial stability. As evidence of the government's foresight, which has chosen to be prepared for a no-deal hypothesis, a whole section deals exclusively with measures in the event of the UK leaving the European Union without an agreement. In particular, this section contains rules on the provision of services and activities in Italy by entities in the banking sector of the United Kingdom after the date of withdrawal, with particular regard to the transitional period. It also provides rules to ensure the operation of Italian operators of trading venues in the United Kingdom during the transitional period. It also provides for provisions for the protection of depositors and investors, establishing that the banks of the United Kingdom that on the date of withdrawal carry out activities admitted to mutual recognition in Italy are considered by right to adhere to the guarantee systems of Italian depositors. The measure also includes provisions for the protection of Italian citizens. Citizens of the United Kingdom are to be treated equally as EU citizens for the purpose of granting citizenship, if they have resided in Italy for at least four years. In addition, a number of appropriations are provided for the strengthening of consular services in the United Kingdom, as well as additional provisions for the protection of Italian citizens residing there. In the third part the measure aims to pursue the objectives of the Government on the protection and protection of the banking system, regulating the extension of the guarantee on the securitisation of suffering. When I come to the conclusion, I would like to make a political move on the Brexit affair. On 23 June 2016, through an advisory referendum, the citizens of the United Kingdom voted by majority for the exit from the European Union. We immediately witnessed a host of intellectuals who, together with the international media system, shouted at the scandal, at the ignorant and devoid of the means necessary to understand such complicated political dynamics, and criticized the legitimacy of the vote. In recent weeks, it has been said more and more often that these future European elections, in which the United Kingdom will also participate, will be a veritable second referendum. In the event of the defeat of the Conservatives, the change of mind of the UK people on the Brexit issue would be clear and clear. <p> As proof of these arguments that want to discredit the outcome of the referendum, the UK Parliament's lack of agreement on the way out of the Union is mentioned. I want to say this loud and clear: it is not possible to give rise to such absurdities. It must be made clear, without fear of denial, that the policy's manifest inability to translate the voices and wishes of citizens into concrete acts, legitimately expressed through a referendum. It cannot become an excuse or an alibi for those who want to reverse the June 2016 vote at all costs. Democracy and popular will are sacred concepts. They are concepts that must always be defended, not only when they are convenient to someone in particular. They are the basis on which our democracies are founded and it is our duty to respect them. With this measure we show that we respect the English people and the Brexit process and we adapt our legal system to protect and guarantee the economic security of our citizens and our businesses.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5689257979393005, 0.43107423186302185]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, given the content of Mr Corsini's report and the extreme and dramatic topicality of the content of this ratification - as the rapporteur has already done - I am not left here to remind everyone of the urgency of his approval. <p> I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Stitches (<PARTY>).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the motions presented today have allowed us to open this debate which clearly highlights absolutely contradictory concepts, as is clear when it comes to these humanitarian dramas. Europe is experiencing this terrible experience and, more than any other country, suffers the negative consequences of this tragedy (along with some states). Indeed, because of its geographical position and its relations with the Mediterranean and Africa, Italy suffers particularly, more than any other European State. Europe is at the centre of a balance between the Union's own aspirations to confirm itself as an area of peace, solidarity and development and the need to ensure security for its inhabitants. It is therefore, what we are discussing here, a serious, almost emerging phenomenon. In many motions there has been talk of emergency, but I would be cautious in using the terms because experts tell us that these migratory flows will persist for at least the next twenty or thirty years, so there is a need to address this problem with structural and absolutely stable initiatives, rather than with emerging measures. I believe that the approach taken by Italy to this phenomenon is absolutely commendable, as was the approach taken by the European States, but they have contributed little to helping our action and often isolated us. It is clear that creating walls, barriers as in fact happened, and derogations from the Dublin Convention or Schengen agreements does nothing but hinder the free movement of migrants in Europe and make Italy's task even heavier and more costly, which is applying in a positive way the important measures that led us, compared to three or four years ago, to a better situation from the point of view of reception. I say this because the hotspots work, the fingerprint collection and the identification of migrants with the Eurodac system work. There is a convention with the ANCI for a fairer distribution of migrants within our surface area, to prevent the creation of peripheral areas of ghettoization in large cities. Therefore, incentives and forms of gratitude to those municipalities (unfortunately still few, only 2,600 out of 8,000) that strive to welcome migrants, certainly work and will have to work. There has been a lot of talk in this Chamber about migration compacts. I would like to say a few words about that, Madam President. It is true that it is absolutely right to address the problem at its root, i.e. in the countries from which migrants leave. But let us be careful, because trials, which Commissioner Mogherini has also mentioned, work where the States cooperate. In some motions, there is talk of creating emigration offices in African states. The idea is good, but how do you create an office where people run away because they are terrified because they lack their freedom? The motions in question contain some absolutely acceptable suggestions. The People's Area Group will vote clearly in favour of those on which the Government has expressed a favourable opinion.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7051000595092773, 0.29489991068840027]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, representative of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with yet another emergency intervention in the area of local authorities, after we passed a law in mid-July which established the new rules of order for their accounts. Instead of creating a climate of regulatory certainty and allowing the bodies that govern the territory to plan their budgets and interventions in support of the reference communities in the long term, a transitional regulatory framework continues to be perpetuated. <p> These are the rules in force, but they do not have to last long. There is a murmur of a further contribution to public finances, which will be requested from the local authorities, to be included in the Stability Act for 2017. So, from now on, by changing the economic and financial framework, the rules will also undergo further changes. <p> The decree-law under consideration, then, contains everything, as is now the custom of the government and as many colleagues have also mentioned this evening during the debate in this House. It has increased further, by making progress, with articles and paragraphs, which come into a text already initially absolutely heterogeneous. So, you have to ask yourself a few questions right away. Is it possible that for whatever happens in Italy there is a need for a decree-law? Is it credible that there is no provision of resources within the state budget to intervene in cases of necessity, without the need for a decree-law? Is it conceivable that we should intervene on everything and, again, on events that occurred back in 1998? Is it permissible that rules of a legal nature should also be changed continuously? This is, in our view, a completely wrong way of proceeding and is a road that only produces regulatory and decision-making uncertainties. <p> The decree-law under consideration, raised from 25 to 41 articles, plus a series of additional paragraphs, however endowed with its own regulatory scope, does not simplify the life of the bodies that deal with the government of the territory and does not solve their problems. With regard to Municipalities, Provinces and Regions, the main problem was and remains to be, in fact, passed from the idea of finance proper to the early nineties to this idea of finance derived to alternate days, which is completely illogical. Each mediation of money has a cost: when mediation takes place in the political sphere and passes through multiple decision-making levels, the initial costs add additional burdens. Therefore, following this wave of anti-politics, which we legislators should have opposed and not indulged, all sorts of nefariousness has been charged to the management of the municipalities, the provinces and the regions. When, on the contrary, those who manage to maintain a certain objectivity, can only recognize that the authorities of the territory have done the best of themselves, producing investments, infrastructure and well-being when they have had own resources available. <p> Of course, there have been some cases of waste that have arisen to the honour of the chronicles, but real waste exists, and there will continue to be, especially at the level of state spending, where control is not close, where the amounts are higher and where the margins of distraction are greater. And certainly the new bow that has now been taken does not reward the well administered Municipalities, but rewards those governed badly, does not reward the virtuous Municipalities, but rewards those spenders. <p> But above all there is no equalization between paid taxes and resources then redistributed to the territories. Resources and responsibilities are the basis of every good rule of local finance in the territories where, both in Europe and in the world, there is efficiency and good administration. And therefore, in addition to being an unjust tax system, it does not trigger that healthy competition between the good governance of the different bodies of the territory, which is one of the calls to attract new residents or new productive settlements. <p> The state mediation, also carried out on the funds that concern the territorial governments, is now completely unfair. This is demonstrated by the fact that there are still too many open financial matches, for example, between the State and the municipalities. This is demonstrated by the need, today, to finance the fundamental functions of the Provinces, which were inopportunely sacrificed yesterday. Said by the way, it's done by taking 100 million at ANAS. <p> The most hallucinating thing is, moreover, to surrender to the idea that without the cauldron containing the equal funds the Municipalities cannot go on. The most serious thing is that we have become addicted to this idea that municipalities, provinces and regions do not have resources. It's not fair to say they don't have them. The truth is that his resources have been removed from this return to a neocentralism of the worst kind. <p> It begins with the cuts in the budgets of the territorial authorities, sacrificing them to the maneuvers of public finance, continues with an uncertain return to derived finance and will continue if the question to the constitutional referendum is approved. If it won the yes, it would have a further centralism, which would leave no room for the action of the new senators, representatives of the municipalities and the co-opted regions in the new Senate. They would not have any real chance of affecting national policies, but not even those of the territories they represent. Another commonplace these days is that, several times repeated, that through the changes to the accounting law in implementation of the reinforced law, resulting from the constitutional news of Article 81, will no longer be possible micro-sectoral or localistic interventions. Apart from the fact that even with the current accounting law such interventions should not have been possible. On the contrary, we all know what happened in the latest stability laws that contained many micro-sectoral rules. But then what should it mean when we say: that we will have to see other decree-laws, such as the one we are now in the Chamber, which are in the middle of micro-sectoral or localistic rules of all kinds, because they can no longer be put into the new budget law? We're obviously crazy! Moreover, we cannot accept the long list of articles and paragraphs added to the decree-law to our examination, for which a late technical report has been submitted, which fails to eliminate doubts about the financial cover. In this regard, a question: is it ever possible that the Government that intends to digitize the public administration cannot send the Senate a technical report in a fully readable electronic format, rather than a bad copy by fax? In conclusion, we are faced with spot rules, from which then there can be no decisive measures of the problems faced. This decree-law, going to add to the other 50 previously issued, convinces us even more of the inadequacy of the government's action. The country literally threw away thirty-three months in which one could try to hook up that shy recovery that characterized the world economy and of which Italy has benefited only a small part. On the contrary, we are pursuing measures that, in form, style and content, follow models already seen and revised, that have not helped and will not help keep the country going. It is such a useless measure - without prejudice to some of the rules that some Members pointed out before my speech, and that deserve our respect - that it would not even be worth commenting on. There is nothing that should be needed to start a new phase for the finances of local authorities, which finally gives the governments of the territory autonomy, resources, programming and responsibility.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5511717200279236, 0.4488283097743988]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Mr Gualdani (AP-<PARTY>-UDC) Mr President, I would like to say at once that, given the timing, I will have to ask to attach part of my speech. First of all, I would like to thank all the Commissioners of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into the phenomenon of intimidation of local administrators and President Lo Moro for their work in a synergistic and compact manner. Mine is a sincere and sincere thank you. During the work carried out, data have emerged about complaints, murders and abandonments (because someone decided to throw in the towel) that have upset us and saddened us. Our main objective, therefore, is to avoid the isolation of administrators. In our opinion, this is a concept that must be the basis of the democratic life of our country. As for the merit of my speech, it is necessary to work to avoid the isolation of administrators, which is often a precondition of intimidation and to strengthen the local institutions, starting from the municipalities that represent, according to a beautiful image used by the President of the Republic, Sergio Mattarella, the face of the Republic, which presents itself to citizens in everyday life. For this reason, it is absolutely desirable to strengthen the means of linking and exchanging information between central and peripheral government, judiciary and territorial authorities. The creation of a network and less discretion in decision-making would not only ensure greater protection for local administrators, but also ensure greater transparency and efficiency in administrative action. The Commission's work has not only been limited to an analysis of the status quo, but has resulted precisely in proposals for solutions which could provide for the spread of the phenomenon. The measures assessed favourably by the Commission can essentially be traced back to two categories: general measures of a largely organisational nature and specific measures, including regulatory measures, within the individual sectors most affected by the intimidation phenomenon. Among the latter, extremely fertile areas for the emergence of intimidation are those of building abuse, quarries and associated mining and procurement activities. The risks associated with the infiltration of organised crime are increasing in the field of trade and licensing and in relation to the gambling sector, as a colleague mentioned earlier. On welfare policies a possible response to the problems associated with this sector could be seen in increasing transparency in the procedures for allocating subsidies, housing and contributions, situations in which local administrators are left alone in their reflections. Finally, I would like to focus on the criminal aspects of the matter. The investigation carried out in the Commission has clearly revealed the need to review criminal law in order to allow the use of currently inhibited investigative instruments and to provide, from a criminal point of view, adequate protection for the local administrator. I very much hope that all the solutions proposed by the Commission, or a large part of them, will be taken into account and that the parliamentary procedure through which the repressive criminal discipline of intimidation forms will be brought to light in a short period of time will begin as soon as possible. Therefore, I announce the vote in favour of the People's Area Group.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6044678688049316, 0.39553213119506836]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies Senators and Senators, representatives of the Government, I am speaking on a specific area of the DEF 2013, the area of health expenditure, which, although within its limits, I believe can well be representative of the Document as a whole both from the technical point of view, central to the cycle of economic and financial planning and budgetary, and under the more strictly political one, is the opportunity to look to the past but above all to imagine the future of the country's economic and budgetary policies, in a European key. These are the textual words of the incipit of President Monti's presentation. At the appointment with the fiscal tightening on public budgets, which became more stringent in Europe after the Stability and Growth Pact and emerging in the second half of 2011 for the facts that you know, health spending presented itself with a growth dynamic strongly reduced over the period 2007-2012, with an average growth rate of 1.7%, which is far from that 6.4% average that had characterized the period 2000-2006. There have been and still are many determinants of a trend in health spending growth, some of which are structural to the evolution of the health system. I would like to mention a few: the introduction of new technologies and new, more expensive medicines, which, at least in the first phase, are added and do not replace old practices or old drugs; the ageing of the population, which expands the audience of the recipients of complex health and socio-health services long term. Other determinants are instead the expression of some problems that have not been resolved, or at least ambiguity. From the institutional point of view, I am thinking of the division of tasks and functions between the State and the Regions; the delays in organizational and management innovation; a plurality of corporate models largely insufficient to govern the complexity of the production of services characterized by a very high density of professional skills and ethical and civil values with few equals in the world of production. To this is added the weight, the burden of pockets of technical inappropriateness, of organizational and management inefficiency, of improper proximity between the search for political consent and administrative management and even of merit and professional quality. Finally, isolated but nevertheless alarming, corruptive phenomena and malavitous pollution are to be recorded. However, we must strongly reject a drift that sometimes emerges also in the debate and in the communication, according to which our National Health Service is an unbearable cost, an inefficient and ineffective wheelchair: it - in reality - is, albeit with all its limitations, a great and extraordinary technical-professional, civil and social work that guarantees research and development, qualified employment and above all, according to the principles of universalism and equity, social cohesion and civil identity to our country. In the coming weeks, the Ecofin Council of the European Union, at the end of May, will sanction our country's exit from excessive deficit procedures. The DEF data tells us that our health care did, as was said a few months or years ago, its homework. The sector's public expenditure in 2012 is, in absolute value, slightly higher than that of 2009; for 2013 expenditure growth in 2012 is reported to be around 0.2 percent, while from 2014 to 2017 an increase with an average rate of 1.9 is indicated, compared to a contextual forecast of growth in nominal GDP higher. This differential leads to an estimate of public health spending on declining GDP, reaching in 2017 the value of 6.7%, which would strengthen our position in the European Union to 15 among the lowest-spending countries, in percentage terms of GDP and absolute per capita. The heavy measures put in place by the Berlusconi and Monti Governments, which, in conjunction with each other, resulted in public definancing by the National Health Service over the period 2010-2014 for a cumulative amount of €25-30 billion (this according to different estimates). Faced with this, I share what has been said by several authoritative and third parties: the National Health Service cannot bear any further public definancing policies, except for the unacceptable fall of universalism and fair access to benefits. In this regard, I recall what President Errani said, that, in representing the unanimous thought of the Regions and the Autonomous Provinces, he asked that the financing of the regional health services provided in 2012 remain such also for 2013, avoiding the net cut of one billion and denouncing the devastating effect on the maintenance of the systems of the forecast relative to 2014 of ulterior two billion share of the citizens to the costs of the services. Tickets have risen, tax pressure has increased, regional rates have risen, especially in regions subject to return plans, and the figures are very close to those of the IMU on the first house. I would like to conclude, Mr President, by recalling the fact that, a few days ago, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, at the end of a meeting, said on the impact in Europe of the economic crisis on health policies.

Here, Mr President, in addressing the reform agenda, including the DEF Update Note, but more incisively in the law of stability, we will have to remember in our choices of this, because this is the Europe we are looking at: the Europe of equity, solidarity, the universalism of the fundamental rights of the citizen.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5162524580955505, 0.48374754190444946]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Milo (<PARTY>). Mr President, the provision for our examination, in Article 1 (7), replaces paragraphs 3 and 3- bis of Article 6 of Legislative Decree No 192 of 2005 on energy performance certificates, abolishing the obligation to allegation from acts of transfer of buildings free of charge and from leases.

Therefore, there is clearly a conflict in this dual legislation. If we do not approve of amendment 1.51, we will find ourselves with the rule of this decree and the rule of the thousand-pronge between them conflicting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 15 October 2021 17 stabbed British MEP David Amess in a church while he was holding a meeting in his constituency in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. His killer is Ali Harbi Ali. David Amess was pro life, pro family, against abortion, against euthanasia, against all that is gender indoctrination. I would like to use the words of Archbishop Kevin Hale, who was a childhood friend of his, to remind this House. <p> Our colleague, ladies and gentlemen, was a British Member who was killed for his commitment. I would like to use the words of Kevin Hale, his friend and pastor, who said: His faith was very strong, thanks also to a good education in a Catholic school in London where I also studied. He was a defender of life in all its forms. In Parliament, when there was a debate on issues such as abortion or assisted suicide, it was very clear and not willing to compromise. It is not to be ruled out that his frankness has prejudiced his taking on governmental roles. In a sense, it can be said that his being a believer did not allow him to \"make a career.\" But this was him: a good Catholic and an exceptional man. <p> David was fearless. In fact, he never accepted special security measures to protect his person because he loved to be accessible to all. <p> Nobody got down on their knees for David Ames. However, today in this Chamber we entrust him to the love of Almighty God, who will certainly not fail to give him the reward of the good and faithful servant. <p> Allow me to make one final remark. This morning, before entering this Chamber, I prayed that from heaven he would intercede for our homeland, Italy, for today\\'s important vote and it seems to me that his intercession was powerful.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6300948858261108, 0.36990511417388916]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now customary for the first acts of the beginning of the parliamentary term to adopt a measure which constitutes Antimafia. We move therefore in the wake of the continuity of a commitment that has led the Chambers to question both the national and traditional mafia phenomenon and - I stress in particular this profile - on the new foreign criminal organizations, which unfortunately have installed themselves on the national territory in parallel with the migrants of their respective countries of origin. It could not be otherwise, waiting for the seriousness of the threat that the development of organized crime represents to the sovereignty of the State and to the exercise of the democratic rights of citizens, in Italy as elsewhere. <p> The text that comes to our Assembly today is the result of a complex and shared work, which ends under the sign of unity, as happened in Montecitorio. <p> I would just like to highlight a few very important parts. <p> Article 1 provides for a legislative mandate and a wide range of investigative subjects: from the management of repentances to the implementation of the prison regime introduced by Article 41- bis; from the adequacy of national anti-mafia legislation to the study of changes in the phenomenon of organised crime; from the relations between mafia and politics, with particular regard to the conditioning in the choice of candidates to elected posts, to defence techniques in tenders. It is still important to stress that it will also investigate foreign mob associations, as I said before, as they operate on the Italian territory, as is also done by various legislators. Article 2, which deals with the composition of the Commission itself, is also important. The idea of naming 25 Members and 25 senators prevailed to make it even more solid and representative than originally intended. Article 4 contains provisions on the rules governing hearings and extends the application of certain rules of procedural law to the Commission's activities. It is then made clear - and this is also very important - that it is impossible to challenge the Commission with regard to the secrecy of the State with regard to facts falling within its competence. There is also a rule that requires documents and documents by introducing a system of exceptions to an article in the Code of Criminal Procedure, so as to allow the acquisition of procedural documents concerning ongoing proceedings. It is therefore possible to refer the internal organisation of the Commission to a regulation. Another important aspect is the accelerated procedure of entry into force, in order to facilitate as much as possible the prompt recovery of the Commission. As a Group of the North League and Autonomy we will certainly support the approval of the measure that we consider to be in line with the interest of ascertaining the extent of the mafia phenomenon, old and new, and the appropriateness of the measures taken to combat it. However, it is regrettable that, more than 150 years after the unification of Italy, the unitary State has not yet managed to come to the head of the problem, which in some respects has also expanded in terms of areas of insistence. In this regard, we would like to point out that it was the North League, in past legislation, that fought for the scope of the investigation of Antimafia to be extended to the regions outside the territory of those traditionally infested by the great organized crime, and not only to take account of the activities of the Chinese triads. We then take the opportunity to claim to a Legist minister, Roberto Maroni, now at the head of our movement, the most excellent results in terms of contrast to malavitous infiltrations. <p> For this reason and because we share the measure as a whole, I already announce that the League will vote in favour of the approval of the reconstruction of Antimafia.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.9263179898262024, 0.07368200272321701]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their speeches, which have all been constructive. I think, however, that perhaps some things need to be emphasized and reiterated. <p> Firstly, I want to talk about the CEO's powers, which are strategic powers and which have been said to be out of the norm. I invite everyone to verify what are the functions of a CEO in any company, but in order to enter precisely the within of the powers of the managing director of the RAI company it is read in the bill under consideration that the board of directors approves the industrial plan and the editorial plan, the estimate of annual expenditure, as well as the investments in the company. It's not the CEO, it's the board of directors. So what does the CEO do? He - again according to the text of the law to our examination - responds to the Board of Directors on the management of the company and ensures the consistency of television programming with the editorial lines and directives formulated and adopted by the Board of Directors. He shall also propose for the approval of the Board of Directors the company's acts and contracts and shall implement the industrial plan made by the Board of Directors. <p> So if we want to say that there's only one man in charge, we don't know how companies work in our country. There is not only one man in command, but a man who takes responsibility, while the industrial and programming guidelines are in the hands of the board of directors. I would like to reiterate that, even in the light of what I have heard too many times. I must also say that, thanks to the contribution of many Groups, the corporate communication and transparency plan is proposed by the managing director, but it is approved by the board of directors. I want to reiterate this forcefully. <p> Secondly, it is said that there is a constitutional problem with the formation of the board of directors. Well, four members of the board of directors are voted by Parliament: this is what the Constitution wants, and these were the comments made. They are not appointed by the Government, but by Parliament. So there is full parliamentaryisation, because it is four out of seven, and one is even appointed by the employees. The majority shareholder does not appoint, but suggests the managing director and the chairman to the board of directors; these are elected and voted by the board of directors itself. I therefore believe that there is no vulnus on this point. Another aspect that many colleagues have highlighted is procurement. Someone has rightly raised the scandal of bribes paid: I would like to remind you that those EUR 38 million have been brought to light by the internal audit. That is, within the RAI a service works, which has provided these data to the judiciary, which is intervening (we'll see how it ends). So today there is (and tomorrow there will be even more) an internal audit system that will monitor procurement. I would stress that contracts which will not be subject to the rules of the code are only those which concern programming, transmission times, in short, the artistic part, because we believe that RAI should have the opportunity to act immediately and to acquire programmes and broadcasts very quickly. I remember however that the limit for the managing director is fixed in 10 million euros. All acts and contracts which amount to more than EUR 10 million shall be submitted for approval by the Management Board. In addition, in this draft law the conflict of interest was raised to greater attention. In addition to that, I would also like to respond to a number of colleagues who have highlighted another fundamental point. I thank Senator Bernini, because her speeches are always very enlightened and I follow them with great attention. I very much respect the prerogatives of this Parliament, Senator Bernini. You have rightly asked why the regulation of the canon has not been included in this law. Senator, Parliament is sovereign: it was in this bill, because the Government had incorporated it in it but, since Parliament is sovereign, that part was rejected by Parliament. So the government has taken up the issue of the canon and inserted it into the bill of stability. More parliamentaryisation of this, what must we do to ensure that RAI really has the chance to be competitive? Finally, no tax in Italy was cut by 17 percent, because the fee was decreased by 17 percent. Why do we keep saying that the fee is a tax? The fee will be paid for 100 euros, distributed in ten or five months, depending on whether you pay the monthly or bimonthly bill. So there was a decrease in the canon. Then, if we are to say that we must promote the evasion of the canon, on this I do not agree objectively, because I think that everyone must pay the canon. Among other things, I remember that the fee you pay in Italy is the lowest in Europe (100 euros). So I think a good job's been done. Some say that this is not a general reform of RAI. Look at the fact that saying that it always takes a lot more is a problem of our country; well-off is a sport very much followed. I believe that we can start from this reform of governance and this reform of RAI management to say that we will finally have a modern RAI, ready with the times and ready to face not only the market, but also all the technological innovations that the future will bring us.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.522625744342804, 0.47737428545951843]}, {'sequence': 'I am against the agenda for G1,301 and in favour of the agenda for G1,292 and G1,304.

They are the living commitment of a great country, as is ours, in an attempt to stabilize the areas of crisis of the world and to intervene in support of the populations that are in a condition of difficulty. There is no ritual in the commitment of thousands of our military that every day fill with pride and should fill our country with pride for the action they are doing. <p> Just as it is not ritual the fact that, even with this measure, we decide to move a quota of military to protect the dam of Mossul and in support of the contingent already present and the Italian company that is called to operate to consolidate that infrastructure. If the United Nations projections are true, in the event of a unfortunate collapse of that dam or an accident, hundreds of thousands would indeed be the victims. But above all, there would be a water shortage for an entire area of 200 million people, and one of the biggest humanitarian disasters would occur. <p> But not only for this we are there; we are also there to affirm the fact that that dam, which is a product of Italian engineering and talent, is one of the interventions that Italy does abroad demonstrating its own level of entrepreneurial, technological and its own great cultural level. Part of this intervention of an entrepreneurial and technological nature also sees the commitment of the State in support of the companies involved and in support of a great humanitarian need. We must be at the dam of Mosul and we must strengthen our military contingent. <p> As I believe we must be committed - as we have already said several times here - to the stabilisation of the situation in Libya. The situation in Libya is changing rapidly. For a few months a government has been established with many difficulties: some ministries have begun to settle in the capital, but it is still necessary for this authority to assert itself in that country. <p> Well, this stabilisation is necessary and fundamental in order also to be able to evolve our policy in the Mediterranean and the policy towards the refugees in the Mediterranean. I must say that I have heard curious things today, including the fact that the people who sink on the boats would be the rich people who come from Africa and who can afford the trip. Things that would be curious if they did not have a profile of difficulty in understanding a process that is not only towards Italy and involves not only our country but a global process that sees the displacement of entire peoples and that we certainly cannot face alone, but with greater convergence with Europe and the other great world powers. <p> The stabilisation of Libya is an absolutely fundamental fact, just as it is essential that there be the garrison of the sea not for a proper rescue of the shipwrecked - because saving the shipwrecked is what we have to do when there are shipwrecked - but because we have to guard the Mediterranean, have our military contingents as garrison of the Mediterranean, is what we have to do when we want to be a power that wants to play a European role and a global role. <p> We have also tabled an amendment - symbolic it is true, I mean it because we will talk about it - which concerns the supply of airplane parts to Egypt. It is - I repeat - an absolutely symbolic amendment, a signal that Parliament wants to give to the Government, which is also put back to Parliament, because it cannot go into the background of the very painful affair that this House has also seen committed to asking the Egyptian Government to clarify and give support to our judiciary over the very violent murder of the young Regeni, which took place in Egypt. Of course it is a story that has dark profiles but it is not an affair from which we derive a change of attitude towards Egypt that we know well to be a power engaged against terrorism, a great Arab country complex, we well know to be a country that has many connections with us; and we know that precisely by virtue of the friendship that has linked us to this country we need that on a story like this there be clarity. Giving a strong symbolic signal is one thing, to say that it would rather be better to break economic relations with Egypt is a different kind of consideration and it was not at all in our intention to propose corbellerias of this kind. With Egypt we have very intense relations and relations but relations between two great countries qualify even if they respect each other. A country that has repeatedly denied itself about this rather complex affair must allow our authorities, together with their own, to shed full light on it. <p> Inside the missions there is our foreign policy, within our foreign policy there is the attitude of a country that is a middle world country but that plays a leading role in international politics. On the other hand, our strategic position, the economic condition and the position of bridge between the Mediterranean and Europe, between the West and Islam, require us, today as in the past, to be a point of connection between different worlds. In military missions there is this function. I too am of the idea - although this is not my responsibility - that we should address it, as we did to the Senate and the House, with a framework law on military missions that allows us to define with stable planning of the Government, our commitment to military intervention as part of our foreign policy. <p> This is what we should be doing next year, but this year the intervention is already over the whole year and not for the next six months, as it usually was. It is already a longer programming over time. It is a step forward that Parliament has shared with the Government and that I believe that this decree-law, which sets out our missions, is confirming both the logic and the objectives and the intentions, both in the practices that are being implemented, and in the seriousness with which we behave in military politics as well as in international politics.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5032532811164856, 0.496746689081192]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> LATORRE (<PARTY>).

It is a reform that expresses and requires innovation, more territory, more Europe, greater slimliness and decision-making speed, greater efficiency, more credibility and lightening of the bureaucratic machine inside, and not outside the democratic process, as a modern country requires. The scope of the reform is being developed in some parts in its core objectives. It does not mean a reduction in democracy, but on the contrary it means putting our democratic institutions in a position to decide, in a more correct institutional and interinstitutional relationship, as Senator Lanzillotta pointed out before. The overcoming of bicameralism was the result of a political debate already present in different forms well before the Democratic Party, since 1996, and therefore in the thesis of the Olive tree, in particular in the thesis n. 4, which provided for an overcoming of bicameralism equal to a Senate of the autonomouss during the Prodi Government (first mentioned Senator Favero). What, therefore, is proposed with the reform of the Senate is nothing more than what the Left had already hypothesized, foreshadowed, proposed in the past, and that it had never reached a point of completion. What we are trying to achieve today and to which we are trying to respond has been awaited for thirty-three years. Today, therefore, after 134 amendments approved by the House and Senate, after revisions of Commissions and Constitutionalists, we are at a point of arrival. Everything is under the sun, within a democratic process. The free fall of historical memory seems to have tarnished or overwhelmed more than anyone. Why, I wonder, should a reform of the Senate's functions, a change of constitutional model that responds to a more broadly territorial and European vision, leave the elective regulatory system unchanged and equal to itself (copy of conformity), unchangeable a priori, regardless of its purpose? Why should it not be legitimate that the second Chamber, in a differentiated bicameralism, is the representation of the autonomy, of the territorial institutions and the autonomy themselves, the territorial institutions to identify their representatives at the level of the future senators, with different functions? Why would direct voting be more democratic than indirect voting in a different institutional reality, in a dialectic between regions in a future Senate? I quote from Mr Cociancich's interesting speech yesterday. According to which a priori? The direct election would perhaps give greater legitimacy to an elective Chamber representing the autonomy, and why? Would that be a counterweight? Well expressed Anna Finocchiaro, and therefore I dare not make considerations in addition, because I have absolutely no competence. But my emphasis focuses on what is the foundation, what is the meaning, being the realities and the purposes of the two differentiated Chambers. It happens in the various models of democracy - as Senator Maran mentioned earlier - in the German, French and United Kingdom model, in which the second House does not have a direct election. The government had more courage than the others, it wanted to change. To the system of redundant counterweights intends to respond with the lightening of the weights, sometimes zavorre that slow down the country system. People expect results, not archaisms that do not help build, do not give added value in terms of democracy, but repeat schemes that slow down the processes of change and democratic innovation. As far as control and guarantee systems are concerned, our system is democratic. Several guarantee institutions secure parliamentaryism: the Constitutional Court, the Head of State as guarantor of democracy, the referendums, the investigative judiciary, the Constitutional Court, the TARs, the regional autonomy. We are called to new and important responsibilities. Let us assume that we must put in place a process of growth and a necessary change of step in the overcoming of a constitutional model of which, for many years, renewal has been invoked by several parties, called into question with rigidities that would prevent the overcoming of equal bicameralism. I hope that these stiffenings will be largely surpassable in a climate of responsibility and political sharing, within a democratic reform necessary for the country, in a path leading to a Senate representative of the autonomy, in the objective of a advancement of the governing democracy; progress that must not be wasted but valorized for solutions that look to the future of the country.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5488051772117615, 0.4511948227882385]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, when constitutional law historians study this revision they will notice an anomaly that we cannot or do not want to see. With the votes of a majority prize spoiled by illegitimacy, almost the entire second part of the Constitution is rewritten. The Court recommended that the electoral law be approved immediately in order to vote as soon as possible, it did not ask to rewrite the Charter. The political class does this just to avoid elections. <p> I know I say something that sounds unpleasant and I almost apologize. It seems that there is, almost unknowingly, an agreement not to talk about it, which says a lot about the alienation of this debate. One changes the form of government of the country, without announcing it, without discussing it as such and without even deliberated it explicitly. It establishes the absolute premiere, as he called it, with trembling of jurist, Leopoldo Elia. He called it \"absolute\" not because it was an authoritarian turning point - as we say today - but because it lacked counterweights, that is, those compensatory mechanisms that are able to transform every power into democracy. <p> Here the fate of the country is entrusted to the arbitrariness of a minority that becomes a majority for artificial reinforcements and not for the consents of the citizens. A majority government is created in a minority democracy, marked by an electoral disaffection that reaches half the population. <p> A leader who collects less than a third of the consensus conquers the bench, is able to govern alone - and so far you can accept - but can also modify the fundamental rules with a biased spirit, without being forced to discuss them with others. For all this, the Premier has an obedient majority of MPs who have personally chosen to be a capitalist. On the contrary, he receives a direct investiture, albeit a minority, in the ballot. This creates an imbalance of legitimacy between the Premier and the Assembly, which translates into supremacy of the executive power over the legislative and indirectly also over the judicial order. The three fundamental powers of a democracy are definitely out of balance. The main imbalance is in the number of MPs, which actually creates a monocameralism: nothing bad, in principle, proposed it with ardor my dear teacher, President Pietro Ingrao, as well as many others in the First Republic, but none of them would ever accept it with a hyper-majoritarian law. However, eliminating the numerical imbalance would be easy: in no European country do we get to six hundred and threey MPs and the government\\'s initial proposal placed the reduction of parliamentarians as priorities. Why then do we not reduce the number of Members? Why does everything change, except the number of members of the Chamber? This question has been unanswered for more than a year. I would like to address the Minister, Mr Boschi, who I hope will at least have the courtesy in replying tomorrow to give this House a serious and convincing explanation on this point. The result is a Senate without functions and without authority: but then it is better to eliminate it completely. <p> There is nothing worse than an Assembly without powers, with the risk that it will get them indirectly, with association with the Government, further degrading the transparency and efficiency of the system. I do not deny the proportional elective Senate, I remain convinced that it was a good proposal the \"Senate of Warranty,\" as we have called it, for the powers and for the direct electoral mandate, but I do not fall in love with the proposals. In theory, the guarantee can also be obtained in a single Chamber, perhaps elected with the single colleges, using qualified votes higher than the majority prize in the legislation of fundamental rights. It is the general balance, not the single proposal, not even the one I dear to the elective Senate. Constitutional legislation is nothing but system production. The quality of a constitutional law is measured by the system effect and here the measure is negative, in all respects. Not even the mediation that overlooks the almost election of senators - a positive step forward, which I appreciate - is able to modify the plant nor reduces the imbalance of the absolute premierate and cancels my personal negative assessment. <p> The opportunity for the reform of bicameralism has been missed, telling a false story to the public. It is not true that there is a problem of speed, on the contrary, the opposite is true: it is too easy to make laws; they approve in a bulimic way, approving a law before the previous one has the time to be applied. Citizens, administrations and businesses are well aware of this and are now flooded with legislation. The new bicameralism should increase quality and not speed, to produce few organic laws, short and readable even by citizens. To this task of high legislation the new Senate had to go, to cure the great codes, then leaving to the House to implement the program of government within a solid and effective framework. <p> It couldn\\'t even be discussed, because there\\'s the Federal Senate fetish. It was a great idea, of course, of Olive and many others: many of us, including myself, have spent the best youth energies on a Federal Republic, but this design has turned out to be disastrous. The regions today are at the lowest point of credibility, as can be seen from participation in the vote. A review should have been made here, in Parliament, of this twenty-year debate, but the government did so alone, taking away the power of the Regions and compensating the political class with the plume in the Senate. <p> Instead, the number of regions should be reduced: I have tabled an amendment on this, because about ten macro-regions could find a profitable relationship with the state and make the country more compact in international competition. <p> Last year I, along with others, expressed my uneasiness by not taking part in the vote. Hoping that the next steps could be improved: the balance, in my opinion, has worsened. The progress on the elective Senate is frustrated by the approval of Italicum and the refusal to reduce the number of Members. <p> In the second resolution we are called upon to make a final assessment. That is why my vote will be against, because there is no constitutional constraint on the part of the party. <p> I already hear the chorus: but then you want to drop the government? It\\'s a stupid question, reading all the papers. <p> It is an amazing reversal between cause and effect. <p> It is unheard of that the Government puts a kind of confidence in political leadership in the change of the Constitution. It never happened in the history of the Republic. That today it is considered normal, that we take it almost for granted, that those who withdraw from the index are the confirmation that the Italian public debate is sick; that already on the agenda of discussion, even before in the solutions, there is a dangerous distortion of principles and values. <p> An artificial constitutional emergency has been built to give political legitimacy to a government without direct electoral mandate. It\\'s yet another Italian anomaly. In a normal country, the government does not deal with the Constitution. In a normal country the Executive governs according to a program presented to voters. You can derogate from these simple rules in extraordinary situations and for a short time; from us the exceptional state will last for almost all this decade. You can\\'t just blame the last ones who came. For twenty years the Constitution has been changed for political purposes: first the CentroSinistra with Title V, then Berlusconi in 2005, Fini with the ius sanguinis of voting abroad, Tremonti\\'s attempts on Article 41. All constitutional reforms failed, because wrong was the method. But already in the 1980s, when the parties lost the country\\'s power of government, they took the habit of saying that it was not their fault, but the Constitution. In order not to face the crisis of politics they have opened a crisis of the institutions; they have begun to browse the atlas of the French, English, American, Spanish and German models. But institutional perfectism is a symptom of the illness of politics; healthy Constitutions are imperfect because they are produced by history. The American decision-making model is crazy; it is devoid of the decree-law, yet it ruled an empire. The imperfections are compensated by the political will, which is like the courage of Don Abbondio: those who do not have it cannot give it. For thirty years the Italian political class, instead of ruling the country, has consoled itself with the teddy bear of institutional reforms. When President Renzi boasts of doing things scheduled for twenty years, he does not realize that he speaks as a conservative. It is the paradox of the scrapers who apply the agenda of the scrapers; they repeat, that is, the most serious mistake: to use the constitutional revision for contingent political purposes. The Charter would be to be changed in many things; I am not among those who make it an altar; but humility is required. Changing the Constitution means serving it, not using it. My generation has not been up to the task. The sad news is that not even the generation after us seems capable of doing so.

I would like to say, however, that the attribution of falsehood to the rapporteur by Mr Marton, I could answer it on a false charge to Senator Santangelo. In fact, when Senator Santangelo protested against amendment 4200 of the Joint Commissions he explicitly referred to the fact that this amendment would allow the free transfer of arms to Somalia. That's fake. It is false, because the amendment includes, in addition to the famous musical instruments, the transfer of four cars equipped with a monitoring and tracking system of mobile phone networks, which are those used by our police forces also for telephone and environmental interceptions. Moreover, the question is not to give to Somalia any kind of good, except of course the weapons referred to in the amendment now mentioned by my colleague Mr Marton; so much so that Amendment 4.2, by Senators Bertorotta, Lucidi, Santangelo and Marton, prior to amendment 4200, provided for the 5 Star Movement's proposal to give free medical equipment to the Federal Republic of Somalia, not better identified, and four dinghy-type vessels. Therefore, arms were neither in Amendment 4.2 of the 5 Star Movement nor in Amendment 4200 of the Joint Commissions. <p> That is the truth, then it was decided to withdraw the amendment, but at least let us restore, also for a correctness towards the citizens to whom Senator Santangelo addressed and who do not have the file of the amendments before them, the truth of the facts. <p> AIROLA (<PARTY>).

Well, that's the transparency of the Count Government. <p> The PNR, third section of the DEF, is usually proposed and presented together with the stability programmes, first and second sections of the DEF, which is the document containing analyses and trends in public finance. The PNR, this year, causes Covid-19 pandemic, was exposed after the adoption of the Chamber and Senate resolutions on the DEF. In this regard, it is important to stress that Italy is the only European country that has not submitted its National Reform Plan to the Commission in accordance with the timetable set. <p> The arguments set out in the document relate to the tax wedge on labour which is too high. The accumulation over time of unequal treatment between different sources of income and the exorbitant complexity of the system are completely truthful but not unique themes because in the historical moment in which we live, the question of taxation is obvious to everyone. The programme also talks about tax evasion and lists a number of solutions, among which the best known is that of a progressive reduction in cash payments resulting in the spread of electronic payments, with great favours for banks and increased costs for citizens and business activities. <p> The use of cash, especially in the trade sector, has always been a valuable and practical tool. It makes no sense to go over the idea that if cash disappears, tax evasion disappears at the same time. The auditions made in the Committee on Finance on current account reports show that large tax evaders and crime are proceeding quietly and illegally with electronic payments using cryptocurrencies and that most of the capital evasion takes place through accounting forgery rather than cash. <p> The economy of our country is represented by self-employed workers, professionals and VAT matches to which a hand must be stretched considering that the crisis lives directly on their skin. For these categories there is a need for a clear position that provides for the simplification of IRPEF and VAT requirements and a revision of the actual and presumed receipts, giving a sponge blow upstream of the infernal system of the balance and the down payment. <p> In this sense, the League is making its contribution with a draft law presented a few days ago that provides, among other things, the elimination of inefficiencies and the limitations that characterize the current system of compensation of claims and debts to public administrations, while introducing an innovative instrument to accelerate and simplify their implementation. <p> As for the flat tax, the League presented a bill on May 29th. In essence, we are aiming for a real and new tax reform with the taxpayer at the centre who must not be vexed by obligations and bureaucracy. Only by giving certainty and stability to the tax rules, by easing the whole system, can the relationship between taxpayers and financial administration be improved, regaining that confidence in the state that is the fundamental prerequisite for a real growth and competitiveness of the country. <p> I shall conclude my speech with a reflection on regional differentialism. A subject which, although addressed, does not receive the sympathy of this Giallorossi majority, as one perceives the will not to give answers to the citizens of Veneto and Lombardy who have expressed themselves clearly in a referendum. More than a thousand days have passed since the consultation that we can also call a plebiscite in Veneto, but there is deafening silence or perhaps an even more serious disinterest, because it tramples on the will of the citizens. Not only Veneto and Lombardy ask for answers on this subject, but other regions have called for the implementation of differentiated regionalism. The government suffers from serious deafness and does not show interest not only in the problems of citizens, but also in local authorities and institutions. The Government is only able to draw up documents and approve them for its use and consumption, such as the extension of the state of emergency, but of everything outside the Palace, citizens, everyday life, workers, business world, school and health care, does not care at all, showing an incredible disinterest and an embarrassing confusion.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5330647230148315, 0.46693524718284607]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Sangalli (<PARTY>).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Government, I must say that the last speech by Senator Pharaoh seems to me a bit like the one in the series: I vote it, but it is not my fault, because the others had done it. This happened during the general debate and even now in an explanation of vote. If things are shared they are voted, otherwise they are not, but this is the footprint of this new Government, which at the first measure raises the first question of trust. I would also like to say to Senator Laforgia, who I do not see in this House now, that we too are very curious about the new forms of work, but I have to say that it is quite tantalizing that, when some young people have come to the Commission to say theirs, if they say something that is not right for this Government, they are hetero-guided. I had the impression - from the moment the boys who came to the Commission had split into two factions, four in the front row and four in the second row, with the hetero-guided in the front row - that those in the second row were led union. Since I have a great interest in forms of work, I would have liked to have discussed the protections, which none of us had in mind not to grant because it is correct that more protection is given to these workers. There was the proposal to make a table to better deepen these new forms of work and instead it was thought well to cage this new form of work, inserting into the law the term digital platforms. I think we should discuss a lot of time about what a digital platform is. The way you chose is this. We listened to a man of forty-three years of age who had just had a failure with a commercial activity and at forty-three years of age and three children got on the bike, managing with dignity to support his family. The piecework has been mentioned; the children, to tell the truth, in the Commission did not ask for piecework, but to evaluate the meritocracy. Fully different visions of life. However, I liked to let Senator Laforgia know that even on this side of the House there is someone who cares about the workers, who has always done so and that it is certainly not an exclusive feature of the left. <p> One thing that we particularly care about as Brothers of Italy is the inadmissibility of our amendments, those of Senator Balboni among the many identical to those presented during the approval of citizenship income. I agree with Senator Martelli that yesterday the rapporteur, Senator Girotto, gave us a lesson in life by explaining to us the immense world of reasons why we could not table these amendments, saying that they were neither part of the citizenship income nor part of the measure under our scrutiny. I read only a part of the report annexed to the provision in which it is said to be \"in consequence\" the repeal of article 12, paragraph 4, of the decree-law 28 January 2019, converted, with modifications, from the law 28 March 2019, n. 26th, which is that of the income of citizenship. So not solicited, but changed. However, this is now the hypocritical House because when the Saracen case happened they tore all their clothes and said that they would provide and intervene because it was no longer supposed to happen. In fact, they didn\\'t intervene, they didn\\'t do anything and they didn\\'t even let us do it and put an end to citizenship income, criminals, rapists and terrorists. I think this is really proof of the hypocrisy of the government. <p> The good aspect of the decree-law, which at first was not there, is the stabilization of the precarious ANPAL. It\\'s a long story. I have listened to my colleagues in the Democratic Party to stress the realization of this measure in tones of victory. The nice thing is that the first opinions that came to us from the government on an amendment that I had tabled together with Senator Garnero Santanchè and an amendment of Senator Parente on this stabilisation, were opposed. Then, - miracles of life - with the very long negotiation that saw again the comedy of the continuous referrals of the Commissions, it was only said that they expected the covers, but in reality they were giving it a godly reason <p> and then arrive at the results we have seen with the amendment that replaces the entire decree-law and on which trust has been placed. Perhaps because recognizing merits on the right becomes a problem for which the opinion is negative on our proposals and then, in the night, opinions are changed. <p> Another thing I have heard in these days is that within the measure there was a fair amendment that proposed to remove the definition Ministry of the family and disability; a Ministry that the government, just arrived, removed. What has left me most stunned is that someone, I don\\'t remember who, said that the associations of the world of disability are content that there is no longer this Ministry. <p> I have the presumption of knowing for many reasons the world of disability and I have never found anyone happy because, when it was established, many of the world of disability had said that finally a specific Ministry would take care of their problems, also because, often and willingly, we remember disabled people in the electoral campaign, and then we will see. <p> I therefore believe that this measure has been really upset in some points because - I repeat - it was the result of a negotiation among the many; a decree-law that, as I said at the beginning, placed the majority within the game of distinctions: this is good because we intervened, but the other part was made by the yellow-green government, so on that, for goodness sake, we must do differently, so we distance ourselves from it while voting in favour. <p> We come to the corporate crises because in these days we have only talked about Whirlpool and Ilva, but we have forgotten the more than 160 open tables; we have forgotten the workers of Mercatone Uno, the workers of Bluetec, hung from the decision to appoint an extraordinary administrator. We have forgotten the many words that Minister Di Maio had said about Whirlpool, reassuring the workers, that since 1 November in fact they are at home, accepting what today the owner of Whirlpool comes to tell us, that the decline of orders and productivity do not justify the plant in Naples, when we all know that in Whirlpool headquarters in Slovakia they do massacred shifts, including Saturday and Sunday, to keep at bay the demand for production. Therefore, Europe is helping all the countries of the East for industrial development; on the other hand, we are bitterly suffering the consequences. <p> Perhaps, beyond the intervention of Minister Patuanelli - I too associate myself with the many words of esteem of these days - beyond the passion with which he exposed the situation in his speech yesterday, I have not noticed an idea of how we will end up with the corporate crises, namely the position of the Government in the merit, especially for the idea of a new country that, as has been recalled, is composed of a population that has always wanted to work, to emerge, that has always been ahead in terms of creativity and ability to work. <p> We are very unconfident and very hopeful that you will go home as soon as possible. <p> For all the reasons set out above, clearly the Brothers of Italy Group will never be able to vote for this Government. <p> You don\\'t respond to the cartel with a sign but with a few expulsions, do you, Senator Barbaro?', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6146249771118164, 0.3853749930858612]}, {'sequence': 'Mr Minister, therefore, according to your amendment, your abnormal amendment, which does not distinguish between absolute judgment and sentence, I and thousands of Italians like myself, who have come out after endless and infernal years from the judicial cage in an absolutely innocent way (and I stress, in an absolutely innocent way), we would still be prisoners. <p> of a theoretically infinite slope. <p> But not only that.

In the absolute respect of the debate, I think we should borrow a speech used by Senator Romano: at least in here, we are moral friends. I believe that, therefore, we should avoid representations of very complicated lives, as if everything could be reduced to the representation of people who are waiting nothing but to kill themselves and commit suicide and of professionals and family members who are waiting for nothing more than to put lives on the balance: that is not the case. Mr President, the difficulty of this draft law lies precisely in drawing up the minimum legal framework for stories, which are made of women and men, which meet and have to make complicated decisions and which invest in what they have experienced and what they still think they can live dignifiedly: hence the concept of mild law. In some passages and in some amendments, which fortunately was rejected, I did not see this idea of mild law, but the idea of a very rigid standardization, almost a kind of solicitation to state care - state care! - and this is not good and is not what I believe, even on the basis of my professional experience, people want. On the history of artificial nutrition and hydration, Senator Scilipoti Isgro', I remember that nutrition is one thing and nutrition is another and the bill at our examination speaks of nutrition and not of nutrition. You can feed, but you can feed badly, but this is true in normal life and you don't need to get to situations of this kind. I remember that because it is a debate that has gone through seven, eight or nine years. Colleagues, you know that, in some way, I have guided the extension of two codes of medical ethics mentioned several times in this debate. Precisely in the last code of 2014 we came to the identification of the subject nutrition and hydration, meeting personally practically all the scientific societies of the national and international sector that deal with this complex matter. I repeat, in some contexts they are instruments that save life in the true sense of the word. Think of the children born with short bowel syndrome and have no other hope than a bowel transplant: they survive through artificial nutrition and hydration, waiting for a transplant that can solve the problem. Think of large surgeries, especially on the digestive system and not only, which in the first twenty-thirty days can only be supported by a totally replacement therapy of nutrition. So, we're talking about health care for all intents and purposes. They're health treatments. Where's the difference? It is in the context in which they are placed. <p> The distinction between therapies and treatments - which we have often called for - whereby therapies are aimed at disease and care for the person, colleagues, in modern medicine does not make sense anymore. There is no possibility of therapy if you do not care for the person. <p> There is no cure without therapies; one cannot only relieve the person without offering him a reasonable and consolidated instrument of improvement and healing. These are the purposes of modern medicine: often heal, but always take care. Old distinctions are between therapy and treatment. There's no medicine unless you meet that person, those needs, that story. <p> From this point of view, I recall the motion that has been referred to several times. I wasn't in the Senate, but he said something very right, as well as - be careful, I address Senator Caliendo - the decision of the Supreme Court that sent the Englaro case back to the appeal court. Already in that sentence it was written that no one can be allowed to suspend artificial nutrition and hydration, because they remain only in the availability of the person. That was also what the majority motion referred to. <p> Just go read it again. What does that mean? Simply that they are medical treatments and that no one, by third choice, can be allowed to suspend, but it is a treatment on which only two cases intervene: the first, which goes to constitute therapeutic aggressiveness; the second, when intervenes a responsible and conscious will of the person concerned.

When the Presidency of this House is entrusted to a fine jurist like you, I believe that a possible reflection can be made on a wrong practice, if there has been: you have the authority and the scientific means to modify it and put the progress of the work in the right direction, in the most correct interpretation of the legal rules, the Constitution and our Rules of Procedure.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6810274124145508, 0.31897252798080444]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 21 January 2014, the judge for preliminary investigations at the Trani Court sent the Senate an application for authorisation to use Senator Antonio Azzollini's telephone conversations in the context of criminal proceedings pending against him. <p> The President of the Senate referred this request to the Council on 29 January 2014 and announced it in the Chamber on the same date. <p> The Giunta examined the application in several sessions and in the session of March 25, Senator Azzollini distributed to the present a summary and deposited a further defensive memory, to which several documents have been attached, specifying that the same analyzes in more detail the profiles indicated synthetically in the summary memory previously deposited. <p> On April 10, 2014, the Giunta accepted the rapporteur's proposal to request, through the Presidency of the Senate, an integration inquiry to the court of Trani, aimed at the acquisition of a copy of the crime report of the State Forestry Corps, as well as the detailed chronological of all entries in the register of suspects charged to Senator Azzollini, in order to know the precise dates of the registrations in the aforementioned register for the individual and different hypotheses of crime. <p> Documentary integration was transmitted by the judicial authority to the Senate Presidency on 27 May 2014 and referred to the Junta the following day. <p> In the session of 10 July 2014, the Junta accepted the proposals of the members to transmit to the President of the Senate the request for the acquisition, by the competent judicial authority, of the order for the extension of the term of the preliminary investigations of 27 January 2012 (and of all the acts recalled within the same), as well as of all the orders concerning further requests for extension of the investigations themselves (with the related acts recalled). <p> The further documentary integration was transmitted by the judicial authority to the President of the Senate on 29 August 2014 and referred to the Junta on 3 September 2014. <p> The request for authorisation, submitted by the judge for preliminary investigations by the Trani court, concerns the interception of ten telephone conversations recorded between 4 May 2010 and 6 October 2011. <p> It should be noted in advance that the judge for preliminary investigations found the intercepted telephone records of users to be unusable on 4 May 2010, for which the prosecutor requested authorisation to use them. <p> The request is in the context of two criminal proceedings pending against Senator Azzollini, in competition with other defendants, which concern the works of realization in the new commercial port of Molfetta, which took place between September 2006, when the definitive plan of the public work was validated, and October 2012, when the Senator resigned as mayor of the municipality of Molfetta. <p> Senator Azzollini, therefore, acting as mayor of the municipality of Molfetta, is accused by the judicial authority of having committed, in competition with others, a series of crimes that are listed in the report that is at your disposal. <p> The judge for preliminary investigations accepted the public prosecutor's request to forward to the Senate of the Republic of the request for authorization to use interceptions against Senator Azzollini, instead rejecting, as previously pointed out, the application lodged by the prosecutor for the use of telephone records. <p> The defense of Senator Azzollini claimed the violation of Article 4 of Law No 140 of 2003, as well as some procedural nullities. The judge for preliminary investigations, after rejecting the procedural exceptions, refers to the judgment of the Constitutional Court n. 390 of 2007, to point out that in the present case Article 4 of Law n. 140 of 2003 does not apply as much as Article 6 of the same law. <p> The judge for the preliminary investigation also states that the request for authorization to use telephone interceptions has been used by Vincenzo Balducci and has been granted not for the offence of office abuse, but for that of association to criminals, auction disturbance, fraud in public supplies and corruption. The telephone calls on Mr. Balducci's users were made from 4 to 6 May 2010 and it should be noted that Senator Azzollini, registered in the register of suspects for the offence of office abuse on 16 March 2009, was also registered on 30 April 2012 for the offences of scam and aggravated scam, while on 5 August 2013 he was registered for the crime of association with criminals. <p> Moving on to the analysis of the reasons underlying the decision of the Junta, it is noted that the second preparatory integration, referred to the Junta itself on 3 September 2014, has revealed, in the context of the requests for extension of preliminary investigations, the indication of the title of crime of association to delinquere for all the co-indicates and therefore also for Senator Azzollini. The same proxy in its letter of 21 August 2014 states: I represent to you how not to deceive - with regard to the legal position of the Azzollini Antonio - the circumstance of the cumulative and undifferentiated indication (omissis) of the titles of crime. In fact, the aforementioned undifferentiated indication of the titles of crime (and therefore also of the one referred to in Article 416 of the Criminal Code) not only can actually be misleading, but it is also likely to create a reasonable doubt as to the date of the effective initiation of investigations against Senator Azzollini for this criminal case. In this case, the constitutionally relevant principle of favour implies the logical consequence that the doubt on such a significant element for the assessment of the occasionality or not of the interceptions on third party users inevitably results in the rejection of the request for authorization. But also to follow the argument implicitly put forward by the judicial authority - that of material error - the profiles of doubt are not solved. In fact, in this case, the registration of Senator Azzollini for the offence of competition in office abuse, dating back to March 19, 2009, made predictable a usual interlocation between the various competitors and, consequently, made concretely configurable for the investigating authority the risk that intercepting conversations on telephone users in the name of third parties could be indirectly intercepted even the Member in question. Therefore, in this case the judicial authority, while not directly pursuing the objective of intercepting Senator Azzollini's telephone conversations through third party users, could not fail to represent the probability (or at least the concrete possibility) that by intercepting third party competitors in the crime, the parliamentarians involved in such competition would also be intercepted. In this overall context, the fact of the nature of the crime entered in the register of suspects may be irrelevant. In fact, even if we merely hypothetically considered that the date of 16 March 2009 Senator Azzollini had been registered only for competition in the crime of office abuse, it would have been expected that the same, even in his capacity as mayor of the Municipality who commissioned the public works in question, could have held regular and repeated talks with the person in charge of carrying out the work itself (and also competitor in the offence of office abuse). This is an absorbent circumstance compared to other issues that emerged during the investigation and in particular to that relating to the actual date of Senator Azzollini's registration for the crime of association with criminals. For the above arguments the Giunta has resolved to propose to the Shareholders' Meeting the refusal of authorization to use telephone interceptions against Senator Antonio Azzollini.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5005471706390381, 0.4994528591632843]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the clarifications given yesterday evening by Minister Padoan to the Commissions meeting reveal that we are faced with a maneuver in line with the previous ones, but that it generates even more deficits. Yet we were left with the words of Prime Minister Renzi last Monday, according to which his government\\'s action would be based not on bonuses, but on structural measures. Structural measures are defined as those which are not occasional or cyclical and which have sound financial cover. The main actions undertaken in these three years do not have the first characteristic. Yet, where they have the first ownership, they are largely based on cover provided by safeguard clauses on VAT and excise duties. The budget law for next year will be 60% of measures to cover the remaining clause for 2017, which is worth 15 billion, covered with 13.3 billion deficits. So it\\'s the government of bonuses, but also clauses. In addition to the safeguard clauses, which will in any case remain in inheritance to the subsequent maneuvers (we remember: 20 and a half billion for each of the years 2018 and 2019) there are the flexibility clauses. This is the other big scam in government economic policy. In fact, people are convinced that Europe, by authorising the flexibility clause on migrants, sends money to Italy to cover the expenses related to their stay in the country, pending the consideration of applications for a possible asylum. In fact, it means that the European Commission authorizes our country for a further deficit expenditure of 3.3 billion, for which Italy will have to issue additional public debt securities. Said by the way, in order to face the crisis of migrants Italy received only 112 million from the EU in 2016, so the reception of migrants today we pay it, but will pay our children and certainly also our grandchildren, considering that by now Italy issues bonds of the Treasury of fifty years. The evaluation that we give of this sixth forecast document of the Renzi Government can be made on the comparison with the forecasts missed from 2014 to the present. The zeroing of the level of net debt, which according to the forecasts of 2014 should have reached near 2017, now moves to date to be destined, that is far beyond the programmatic horizon of 2019. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the expenditure for post-earthquake reconstruction (for which an additional flexibility clause of 0.2 has been requested) is to be considered a truly exceptional expenditure, because it represents the right compensation for the survivors of the earthquake in central Italy and an investment in the housing and public heritage of the affected areas that will surely move the economy of those areas. On the contrary, for migrants, they are public resources badly used for an event widely anticipated and therefore avoidable. Expenditure on the management of migrants has almost tripled in recent years. The expected amount for 2017 will be equal to last year\\'s, i.e. 3 billion and 300 million. So nothing unexpected, but rather the result of a bad foreign policy that did not put Italy on the European tables. With the new deficit spending, the target for reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio is also moving, which remains in 2017 consistently above 132%, even in the new policy framework. Very far, of course, the level of 120 percent considered \"sustainable\" for the Italian public accounts, which had also been secured as a goal reachable for 2018 in the DEF of two years ago. Meanwhile, the Government continues, and should be stressed, to benefit from the gift of Mario Draghi and the ECB, which will continue to buy our securities at least until the next year. I would like to add another point: I think that an economic and policy document should contain serious assessments on debt sustainability. In fact part of the maneuver for next year will be supported thanks to the lower passive interests estimated at almost 5 billion. Gross domestic product estimates fall relative to the initial programme framework mandate, despite an increasing level of government spending under the control of GDP growth. 28.5 billion nominal GDP growth in 2017 now seems unrealistic, because inflation is close to zero. But the problem is not how accurate are the forecasts of the increase in gross domestic product, which grows despite the largely depressive action of the Government. The question that needs to be answered is why investors flee Italy. In fact, both the Italian savings and the money of world investors, unfortunately, are not attracted by the productive activities of our country. The new maneuver, therefore, will be based on one-off measures, on the many, too many, bonuses and on the few cuts in waste. We continue to read a very dangerous underestimate of the dynamics of current spending. What is missing in the Note are precisely the proposals; first of all, how to bring out from under the brick the savings of our fellow citizens, and then how to recreate trust in the country system. The fall in the income of Italian households must be met with policies that guarantee a lasting hold on purchasing power. That is why we need concrete facts. In fact, despite the Renzian story, the Italian chronicles still speak of smart cards, schools without professors one month after the beginning of the school year, of ceilings that collapse in the classes, of fake refugees that cost the Italians 35 euros a day, of urban degradation, of corruption cases, of deaths in hospital lanes: that is, of an Italy that has not at all changed towards. Then it is also pointless to move the debate on the substance of the 47 modified articles of the fundamental charter. The no to the referendum must be a clear vote against the disastrous economic policy of these years of the Renzi Government, which has indebted the country at a record level and which would continue if the country, in December, gave confidence to this Executive.

We are, therefore, very late and we come with a text that - alas - is far too outdated. Together with some Eastern European countries, we have remained among the last in the European panorama that we have not yet regulated the matter. <p> I have been careful and listened to so many speeches in favour and against the so-called Cirinna bill. I am sorry to have listened a few minutes ago to the intervention of Senator Marinello, who as an argument to discredit the rapporteur wanted to use her commitment to protect the rights of puppies of dogs and cats. He, however, provided me with an assist on a silver platter. In this regard, I would like to remind you of the arguments used by those who support the no and opposed the equalisation of civil union with marriage, in order to make clear the level of the debate that has taken place from this point of view. Some of our eminent colleagues have said that while marriage is null and void if it is not consumed, it is not possible to understand well who goes to determine what kind of relationship there is between those who conclude civil unions. Someone else had the courage to say that the presence not only of the mother, but also of the father allows our species to have a greater possibility of development and with a brain greater than that of the other animals of our stature. These were the arguments used in favor of the argument that civil union cannot be equated with marriage. Then I heard what I call, in this and in other places, the well-alternists, that is, all those who remind us that there is much more to be done in this country: there are the issues of work, emigration and the economy. These are all issues that this Government is fully concerned with. Let me remind you that we have inherited a country with a very high unemployment rate, with a GDP of -2.3% and now we can look at positive numbers, i.e. at +0.8%. We are, therefore, dealing at 360 degrees with the recovery and revival of our country, while those same people whom I call well-altrist, who have had the responsibility of government in the last twenty years, have actually taken care to do much more and have left us all this in inheritance. Furthermore, I do not believe that civil rights are something to be dealt with in the second place, because I believe that they are absolutely central to the lives of citizens. I was saying it's a historic day. Well, Senator Zanda and President Renzi didn't come back. I thank Senator Cirinna and my colleagues who, in the Commission for justice, have given their souls to bring this text as it is to this House. It is - in my opinion - not a text that is a downward compromise, but one of the highest mediations that could be done, because it allows us at least the recognition and extension of social rights. As far as stepchild adoption is concerned, I do not think that this issue should be deleted, but that it is the most correct proposal possible to guarantee the right of children to live in a loving family context, to be loved by parents, of whatever sex they are. Under no circumstances does the text mention recognition of the right of parents to have children, but of the right of children to be loved and to have recognized their right to be loved in their families. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. Senator, I invite you to conclude. Mr Spilabotte (<PARTY>). It has also been used as an argument for miscommunication that stepchild adoption opens up to the use of the practice of the uterus for rent. It's not written anywhere. There is Law No. 40 of 2004, which is bad, which has been removed from the judges' judgments and which I hope this Parliament will give way to give a decent law to our country. The text in question does not mention it and I have not heard any of those who have made heartfelt speeches against this issue say, instead, that it is a practice adopted by 84 percent of heterosexual couples, who consider it more morally acceptable to buy a child abroad, rather than adopt one, since they have the possibility to do so in our country. I have never heard them move a finger or make an accurate intervention, as I have heard them do, at the time that said practice is followed only by 2% of gay couples.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5819482803344727, 0.41805171966552734]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked and agreed with the President of this House to bring forward an issue which I would have liked to have been referred to, but which we are debating at this stage of our work. It's about the expulsion of Senator Adele Gambaro, rea of having given an interview to a private television. <p> My assessment is that this is a public fact which has very clear institutional evidence. It is not a private fact; it does not belong to the internal life of a party, even if, if it belonged to it, it would still be amendable, rather condemnable. <p> My view, Mr President, is that a fundamental constitutional freedom, freedom of thought, is being violated, and that the expulsion from a parliamentary group and not from a party is a significant turning point. <p> Parliamentary groups on the one hand of Italian jurisprudence are regarded as parties. I am well aware of the controversy that has arisen over time and I know, for having studied it during the night and this morning, the controversy that has been built over time: Groups considered by a certain jurisprudence similar to parties. <p> On the other hand, I belong to the branch of those who believe that the parliamentary groups do not have the nature of the parties. Parliamentary groups are an expression of a parliamentary structure. They are parliamentary groups. In their constitution they respond to rules. If those rules are not complied with, you correctly, Mr President, by applying the rules, do not allow the establishment of a group, as your own colleague, President of the House, does not allow the House of Deputies. <p> Here we are even faced with an even more particular case, because we are in the presence of a sort of censorship, that is, a sort of pre-emptive denial of the expression of an opinion, therefore the fact that we do not correspond to a constitutional principle that the constituents have protected in Article 21 of the Charter: freedom of thought. <p> I address three questions to you, Mr President, and to our colleagues. I want to know if we are in the presence of an anti-democratic and anti-liberal regulation of the Five Star Movement. I would ask you whether you are in the presence of a regulation which has such characteristics and whether it can be compatible with the democratic and liberal nature of the Senate in which each of us sits. Finally, I would like to ask you whether - and this is the case - the Rules of Procedure of the Groups should be based on the logic that inspired those who wrote the Constitution: such a clear, so clear and clear logic that there is absolutely no need for debate in this House. <p> On the contrary, it reminds me, seeking and searching, that that custom and behavior are children of another Charter and of another article: not of Article 21 of our Charter, but of Article 35 of the Constitution currently in force in China. Article 35 guarantees freedom of speech, but that Constitution obliges you to read this article in conjunction with the general principles. This is exactly what happens between statute and reference to the principles that guide the Five Star Movement. When these principles are at odds, in opposition to the main document, it is not possible, and therefore prohibited, freedom of speech and expression. It cannot by norm be exercised that freedom. <p> I believe that the groups are different from the parties and that within this House they must have regulations inspired by the parliamentary democracy to which we have been educated.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6461637020111084, 0.3538362681865692]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, members of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, in the face of such a delicate, complex and important geopolitical crisis, which also affects our country, we expected this information to be of absolute priority in this House. Too bad for this inexplicable length of time and for this delay! One could say: better late than never, but I do not intend to argue, because I am not passionate and anyway it is not the time, nor the place. <p> Excellent work, however, on the five proposals. We can only start from a fundamental point: the degeneration of the situation in Afghanistan shows that democracy is not exportable, where it is not supported by proper assumptions and where there are no other predominant interests. Thinking about changing or imposing the culture of others is unacceptable, especially when the objectives of such a policy are not clear, since every people has its own historical and cultural process. We must not be tempted by the desire to export democracy, but it would be better to focus on the protection of human rights at global level, which have no national borders. This must be done only through targeted action and diplomacy, together with a decisive fight against international terrorism. <p> This is the ideal time to prove it. <p> Foreign policy is not based solely on the political ideology of the individual parties, but on multilateral diplomacy or on the interests of each individual action alone, since politics itself is not based on feelings or first impressions, but on realism and, that is, the ability to read and interpret the real situations by how they present themselves in order to arrive at a quality solution. It is this capacity for organizational cohesion that the European Union lacks today in a world that already shows the effects of globalisation even from a geopolitical point of view. <p> We cannot risk Europe remaining on the margins of foreign policy or, worse still, being subject to the decisions of other world powers. We are now facing the consequences of the crisis. We will have to protect the real refugees, as also covered by the guidelines of our immigration policy, through a joint effort and shared by all the countries of the European Union, without forgetting that we must find a Community identity and vision in foreign policy and not only to combat terrorism and guarantee freedom and rights won. <p> It is clear that Italy alone cannot accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees either because of structural limitations or because of the necessary caution to avoid the imminent risks of terrorist infiltration. <p> At the same time, Ministers, it is essential to implement action to counter the barbarism of human trafficking. <p> This is the time to act and no more useless words. The rapid disengagement of the West in Afghanistan and the simultaneous rise of the Taliban cannot blind us and indifferent to the scenes we have witnessed. In fact, it is intolerable to confine ourselves to witnessing manifest violations of human rights and the rule of law, together with tragic scenes of an imminent humanitarian crisis. All this can only be a source of unpredictable global risks linked to a situation of absolute instability and uncertainty, in addition to the Libyan, Syrian and Lebanese ones. Parliament must be the place for dialogue and debate as the home of democracy. This must take place both in the strategic and protection choices of true refugees and in the protection of the right of the Italian people to live safely from the risk of uncontrolled immigration and, above all, of potential terrorists. Never before do we need a clear vision of the actual evolution of the humanitarian and geopolitical crisis in order to achieve a sharing of responsibility between all the countries involved, covering two specific guidelines: the protection of human rights and the protection of international security. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to our women and to our men who have been engaged in Afghanistan. I am thinking of soldiers, policemen and civilians who have done immense work in what has proved to be an extremely complicated scenario in the global chessboard. A moving thought goes to those who fell to serve our country <p> joined by a heartfelt hug to family members. <p> Another important thanks goes also to the thousands of Afghans who worked side by side with the Italian contingent: it was comforting, in the image of the tragedy, to see the extraordinary work of our diplomatic network in evacuating those people.

I feel this responsibility on my shoulders as if it were a form of respect for those who have lost everything: relatives, friends, work. <p> Today we are talking about almost EUR 200 billion: the new Marshall plan of the century has been defined several times by the media. That is precisely why, Mr President, I would like to share with you and the senators present in this House a simple reflection of my own: 180 billion budget deviations burned in a year, made at jumps and hiccups of 30-40 billion at a time; crumbs of 600 euros to some and others not even those; forgotten categories, as well as entire chains, gymnasiums, associations and small businesses. I could go ahead and quote thousands, but here's the thing: 180 billion in a year we didn't even consider them as a great opportunity, because it was our money, while 198 billion in five years we consider them the Marshall plan. I think that 180 billion was our Marshall plan, and I would like to say something to the senator who preceded me. I will be allowed to say that a rather bizarre nation cannot fail to consider this, as well as - and it has not finished the surgery, in my opinion, saying that during the pandemic there were those who ran those 180 billion - it cannot fail to consider the fact that we were simple extras - I remember - while the actors of that plan were others and we could do nothing but try to put the boat back on its course. Mr President, I have many flaws, but sincerity and honesty, at least as far as I am concerned, I think it is essential to pass them on to our children. I have therefore taken to heart the work on the recovery fund from the first day, facing every debate with the utmost seriousness and willingness to dialogue and confrontation. I did it without the interests of the shop, while I was in the minority months ago, when the whole route began, I continued to work with the same tenacity and stubbornness. Unlike those 180 billion euros thrown out of Italy, I would like these other resources to be spent with criterion and in a correct way; we owe it to all those who have suffered and who are suffering from this pandemic, which seems to me not to end anymore. Politics, we know, is the art of mediating and changing things, and it always does so in its own way; sometimes I too find it difficult to understand how it succeeds. However, it is always difficult for politics to change people like me: it is a kind of hate-love. I was the first to denounce the lack, if not null, of Parliament's involvement in the Commission. I was the first to raise my voice on Parliament's lack of ability to get into the substance of the Plan. And I still remember those angry smiles of former ministers at my words and I'm not talking about prehistory, but just a few months ago. I was the first to say that the Plan had to be centered not on the Mezzogiorno, but on the whole of Italy, because the pandemic struck to death starting its descent right from my land and then afterwards hungry the whole country. Let's never forget this. This is no longer the time for divisions: it is time to start our country together. You do not know or even imagine how much I would have liked to have been here today with a framework of clear commitments and investments, to be voted with pride, to be shown to the nation. How much I would have liked to have in my hands a plan of investments that would say black on white to the Italians, to the whole Italy, from the Valle d'Aosta to Sicily, what are the projects, where they develop, such as for the Center, for the North, like for the South; what will be the economic repercussions; what will be the cost-benefit analyses; how will we face the conditionality. Today we do not have to present and share all this. We audit almost 300 people, associations, ministers, professors, committees. We have not spared ourselves on anything, and I thank Mr Stefano, the whole Commission and the political forces who took part, at a very difficult time for everyone, in red areas, in meetings in presence and at a distance. I would like to make my contribution to this Plan. It is my political, civic and moral duty. I don't want to, and I can't back out, because I don't think it's right. Politics must take responsibility and sometimes make difficult choices. Today is for me one of those days of difficult choices: I will have to express myself and I will have to direct my decisions on trust to an Investment Plan which, for a maximum of almost 200 billion, will be drawn up by technical offices; in essence, it will be almost totally redone by the Ministries; it will not be drawn up - as is to be believed - by this Parliament, which has not even seen it and will not see it until the last useful day before going to Brussels to be presented, but which is taking its paternity responsibly in fact. It would hurt me, Mr President, to discover one day that our children are in a position to pay for the strategic choice that a technician made, because that blessed time to work differently unfortunately was not there and never there. I understand, on the other hand, the difficulties of the new government to face in thirty days a job that, at least, had to last eight or nine months. I understand and see a job, the previous recovery plan, totally wrong, started in the birth in the wrong way, underestimated and inevitably left in the hands of bureaucrats who are trying to rewrite it. I am morally obliged to vote on the majority motion for a resolution precisely because of the responsibility speech I made earlier, but I cannot allow the country to lose even a single penny of that Investment Plan. I just hope that those offices have worked and worked in the last thirty days with the same tenacity and will that I have put in it and put the Commission in it. We have delivered 73 pages of joint report, more annexes and detailed Commission reports.

I want to think that this means that, even between the current two-year period and the current three-year period, there is a remodulation, because if the latter were to take place, as is precisely the risk indicated by several parties, with a reformulation of the hourly loads within the current two-year period and the current three-year period, the problem would well arise again. The point is that, while of course the autonomy of Italian institutes and universities, this experimentation is taking place - as indicated in the question - at the same time as the suppression of the teaching of theoretical philosophy, in particular in some university courses of the faculties of education sciences and pedagogy. This poses the risk that, within our secondary and university education system, action will be taken to strengthen, even positive, scientific culture. It is true that, despite the excellence that our country has produced in the field of scientific culture, perhaps there is a delay, an underestimation of centrality, of the importance of scientific and technological culture, also with respect to the international context in which we move, but it is equally true that the consolidation of scientific culture, if we do not want to be limited to becoming a mere procedural execution of techniques, needs that long look that only a thought - a philosophical thought, a theoretical thought - can give to ensure that science does not resolve in mere procedures and applications of techniques but can be instead indication of choices, identification of perspectives, capacity for relationship, understanding and therefore of design. From this point of view, I am satisfied with the richness of the answer. There remains the concern that, in the remodulation of the programs and the hourly loads of the secondary schools, in particular those few schools in which today is present the teaching of philosophy, on the one hand, and in the redetermination of the articulation of the work plans of the faculties of science of education and pedagogy, on the other, philosophy is sacrificed. From this point of view, I note in a positive way the commitment that the Undersecretary has made here, on behalf of the Government, on the desire to make sure that the scope of this teaching is not reduced within our education and training system, because it would really be a failure compared to that excellence of our thought, our culture, which thanks to its creativity today manages to be internationally competitive even from the scientific, technological and productive point of view; and it succeeds precisely because it has behind that long thought that a strong philosophical, cultural and theoretical tradition has supported in the history of our country.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7242327332496643, 0.2757672965526581]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, representatives of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, Senators, I will not enter into this barren controversy with the minority, because it is not worth it and Italy no longer has time for you. It's time to stop. <p> Today we treat the conversion into law of Decree-Law No. 44 of 2018, regarding urgent measures in the matter of social shock absorbers by way of derogation, that is, we are going to debate the need to finance, for an additional 9 million euros, a measure of Cassa Integrazione gains by way of derogation, so as to cover the whole of 2018 for 1,000 workers of Sardinia. <p> It is a measure that comes to us from the past and on which we were in practice prevented from intervening because, as has been mentioned, it expires on 8 July. In fact, therefore, any amendment approved would have involved a new move to the House and thus prevented it from falling within the allowed time limits. <p> The measure is very simple and limited, it is a punctual measure; a task coming from the past Government, like many measures that we have become accustomed to seeing in the last legislature. He wears a piece of rag hoping he can hold on. <p> If, on the one hand, it is a measure due to about 1,000 workers (with their families), belonging to two areas, that of Porto Torres and Portovesme (North-West and South-West of Sardinia), recognized as areas of complex industrial crisis, on the other we can not avoid to make some reflections on the fact that in recent years different areas in Sardinian land have been abandoned to themselves and today we find entire areas in a state of deep employment and economic crisis. <p> Little or nothing has been done in recent years to revive the employment of Sardinian workers, indeed. Years of austerity policies have proved to be - as we predicted - highly recessionary and, of course, have contributed to creating the best conditions for a perfect employment storm, indeed a perfect employment tragedy, throughout Italy, including islands of course. <p> With this measure we will go to give the 1,000 workers (with their families) a breath of oxygen until the end of the year, but we know very well that in the coming months we will have the burden of going to help in a much more structured way the occupation in Sardinian land. About 1,000 euros per month net to 1,000 workers, about 1,500 euros gross for six months, equal to 9 million euros: well, but after that? Without a doubt Sardinia is a region with a strong tourist vocation and without a doubt the new minister of tourism, Senator Gian Marco Centinario, with whom we congratulate for the new assignment and to which we make our most felt good luck <p> , will be able to enhance even more this inclination. But we cannot think that the whole island, inhabited by more than one and a half million souls and third in Italy by extension after Sicily and Piedmont, can depend on a single sector, albeit driving. <p> Therefore, we must rethink the potential of the island, trying to enhance its strategic position in the center of the Mediterranean as well as manufacturing excellences, capacities in agricultural and pastoral activities and the development of niche industrial sectors, which could find opportunities for growth here. <p> I would like to thank both the Joint Committee of the House and the 11th Committee of the Regions for their work. Commission of the Senate for the speed with which they were able to dismiss the measure which, in particular, consists of three articles. <p> In the first article are confirmed the industrial poles of Porto Torres and Portovesme which areas of complex industrial crisis and therefore in need of an urgent intervention aimed to extend the extraordinary mobility for the aforementioned 1.000 workers approximately. To this end, the Region of Sardinia is allowed to allocate EUR 9 million from the Social Fund for Employment and Training for the refinancing of social shock absorbers by way of derogation in those areas, covering the whole of 2018. <p> In the following second article it is clarified that the financing of the extensions of these social shock absorbers is also allowed for the Regions that have adopted the extension after 31 December 2016, provided that it concerns treatments that expire by that date and in any case the duration of the extension does not exceed 31 December 2017. <p> This does not entail new or higher charges because, according to the provisions of Law No 205 of 2017, resources are used that had already been allocated to the two areas in question through the repartition established by Article 44 of Legislative Decree no. 148 of 2015 and that have not yet been completely exhausted. This breakdown took into account all the suspensions or reductions in working time that began before the end of 2016, even if the Region had not yet started the process for the due social shock absorbers that could have started following a specific agreement signed by the parties at the crisis units of the Ministry of Economic Development or the Regions themselves by that date. In practice, the situation which has made this change necessary is the result of a regional delay in the adoption of the measure granting the treatment to be extended. If there had been no such delay, the extension could be adopted in continuity, as already mentioned, on the basis of Article 1 of Law No 205 of 27 December 2017. In short, someone between Regione Sardegna and MISE has a little slept, abbreviated: <PARTY>. However, Article 2 overcomes the disparities that would arise between identical factual situations, since they all originate from events prior to 31 December 2016. Finally, in the last article, the law is required to enter into force. I shall conclude, Mr President, with a final comment on the situation of work in Italy. The League is very concerned about the situation it has found. The data that we are shocked about a growing fantasy-employment actually make the photograph of a nation in severe employment difficulties, whose citizens are forced to accept employment contracts in the vast majority of fixed-terms and for very limited periods of time. The fixed position is now a mirage and moreover the reforms desired by Renzi have in fact made even the newly hired indefinitely precarious. But what future can a person plan that the day before doesn't know if the next day he will still have a job? What kind of life is that? We in the League believe that work must become the central theme of this legislature and we will not save energy to reverse the trend. Less layoffs, less welfare and greater commitment to create the conditions necessary for the relaunch of employment, in Sardinia as in all the rest of Italy. <p> Senator Rizzotti is registered to speak.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5855941772460938, 0.41440585255622864]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> <PARTY>LIPPIN, rapporteur. Mr President, I must confess that I am witnessing this afternoon's debate with some confusion. It is as if the debate at last Thursday's afternoon's sitting had not been held. Paradoxically, I hear the same arguments with which the rapporteurs have proposed the deletion being used now against simple ratification. Of the two at one, then: either we were wrong in proposing the deletion, or, of course, if we proposed the deletion, there was a reason. The reason was the difficulty of adapting the institution of kafala to our system and our order. But what does it suggest, what does the Convention we are talking about contain? I apologise to the House, but I will read the text of Article 1 of the Convention itself. The purpose of this Convention is to determine the State whose authorities are competent to take measures to protect the child or the property of the child; to determine the law applicable by those authorities in the exercise of their competence; to determine the law applicable to parental responsibility; to ensure the recognition and enforcement of protective measures in all Contracting States; to establish between the authorities of the Contracting States the cooperation necessary for the achievement of the objectives of the Convention; or to determine which authority and law apply to a child who is no longer in the State of habitual residence. That's all. The problem of kafala, that is to say the legal institution that must be applied to the child who should enter the Italian territory, is so full of problems, but that is why we have proposed to the House the deletion precisely in order to assess which institutions of Italian law it is best to apply in order to ensure full respect of all the constitutional principles that here, in Italy, do not touch for anyone, man, woman or child.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7430494427680969, 0.2569505274295807]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, in a few minutes I would also like to express my thoughts on the fact that we are here in the Senate Chamber only five days after the deadline for conversion has expired. But I want to do it with words and accents a little different from those that preceded me, because I would like us to be free for once from certain tones of hypocrisy and rhetoric that are always present in these debates. <p> It is true that we all complain about it and that we regret that we do not have time as members of the Senate to intervene on this decree. However, let us tell the truth: this has happened many times apart from the reverse when we sent the measures to the House at the last moment and heard the complaints of opposite sign coming from that House. Then we also know that the long time needed for the House to discuss this measure was the result of a very heated and complex political and merit debate that took place in the majority and in the Commission. I think we all have to take care of these issues. That discussion is also part of ours; we cannot imagine it as something outside of us. I would like to say this very quietly because otherwise we lose much of our debate in a lamentation that does not make much sense. <p> Having said that, I would like to stress, as we have already said in the examination of the so-called cultural value decree, which arrived in this House a few weeks ago and which we too have dealt with inverse parts for a long time, that this decree is characterized essentially by a sign of reversal of trend: after a long time we have measures that come back to invest resources, perhaps not all that we could have expected, but still significant resources around some crucial issues (school building, personnel, training and school dispersal). I think that we must treasure, take note of this and commit ourselves to translating it quickly into measures that have an influence not only on school, but also on the resumption of that dynamic mechanism of our country that is indispensable. <p> In a few days' time we will be discussing the law of stability in this House, and we know that the key issue of that law is to be able to guarantee the 1% objective of development, otherwise many of our discussions will not stand. Well, these measures can make a small contribution to this prospect. We must be able to grasp the link between these investments and the overall development of our country. <p> Other members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists will speak on these complex issues and I do not want to say more, but I would like to stress the positive inspiration of the measure that we are about to adopt with conviction. <p> In conclusion of my brief speech I simply want to underline the important value that has a significant novelty present in the decree on a particular and marginal piece which, however, after a long time, finally sees a correct and positive approach, in my view. It is the question of the solution of the node, even complicated and dramatic, of the future of tied musical institutes (Article 19 of the Decree-Law). It may seem a very lateral topic (it is certainly not as crucial as many others), but in many cities and capitals of our country this theme is relevant and is part of an overall initiative necessary for the revival of culture and musical education in our country. <p> I note positively - we must say this - that the decree of Minister Carrozza and the Government contains three important commitments, which I want to summarize. The first is a provision of resources, which have also been increased by the House (therefore, the debate also had a positive outcome), in order to meet a dramatic and survival situation of these institutions, to date governed by Municipalities and Provinces and, in some cases, by some regional contributions, which risk to collapse due to the difficulties of local finance. This is a first positive commitment. <p> There is a second one which concerns the opening of a technical table committed to defining an overall reorganization programme for the whole sector. <p> And then, above all, there is the idea of the construction of a unitary system in which the conservatives and music institutes, as the law already says, are parts of a unitary system. <p> I think that we must value these results and then commit ourselves to a practical translation as soon as the decree is operational.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6428804993629456, 0.35711947083473206]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> RANUCCI (<PARTY>).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fiscal link is the first step in the new budgetary session. A session this year that begins in a macroeconomic context that allows us to be confident for the future. The overall picture is different from that of the beginning of the parliamentary term and has seen us hard engaged in these years. As far as Parliament\\' s proceedings are concerned, an intensive and laborious work has been carried out on improving and enriching the text, which has allowed us to come to this House today with a shared text. For this reason I would like to thank the availability and collaboration of Vice Minister Morando and President Tonini. During the work in the Budget Commission, a number of substantial amendments were made to the text, which as a whole confirmed the overall layout of the measure and improved certain aspects, significantly broadening the areas of intervention. At this point, I would like to focus on some of the amendments that were adopted during the referee\\'s examination. With regard to companies, I would like to mention the increase in the provision of the Guarantee Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can also be supplemented by the intervention of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. It is an initiative that greatly increases the financial potential of the trusts and goes in the direction of supporting, through this intervention, the business world. As far as health is concerned, I would like to point out that a scheme for the experimental deduction of food for special medical purposes for two years is being introduced. These foods are indispensable in some diseases of malabsorption for which, given the extension and diffusion in Italian society, we consider it important to experiment with this intervention, helping those who suffer through the possibility of deduction. In addition, I think it is very important that the approved rule on the sale of electronic cigarettes, which is causing a lot of controversy in these hours. On the sales side of electronic cigarettes containing nicotine, we have provided for the prohibition of online sales, establishing that this is possible only through the circuit of tobacco shops and authorized specialist retailers. We felt that health protection had priority over a free and uncontrolled marketing of these products via the web. In fact, the rule refers only to electronic cigarettes containing nicotine. Let\\'s get this straight. Due to the lack of administrative controls that have allowed a series of elusive and evasive behaviour of some companies, the State, on the sale of electronic cigarettes, has collected only 4 million out of 115 expected on an annual basis. Not only that. As a result of the litigation pending at the Constitutional Court after a postponement of the TAR, these same companies applied the consumption tax not on the quantity of liquid (as expected) but only on the quantity of nicotine thus paying only one tenth of what was due to the tax. An authentic scam against the pockets of the Italians. But this isn\\'t over. Because of this administrative and accounting jungle the online trade of products containing nicotine could thus proliferate mainly with trade on websites of foreign companies and allowing some sales not to be regularly recorded and declared. Thanks to this chaos, these products are sold to date without any control (health and tax) even in unauthorized stores where the liquid is even diluted so as to obtain a higher quantity to sell. That is why, with our amendment, I wanted not only to put an end to a genuine illegal nicotine trade but, above all, to allow every single product put on sale to be preceded by a control that allows its traceability and recovery of a revenue of about 10 million euros to date not paid to the detriment of the pockets of all Italians. Just a few hours after the adoption of my amendment came both a judgment of the Constitutional Court that finally makes clarity on the rule in question, and a circular of State Monopoly announcing the closure of sites that sell nicotine products not according to the norm. In short, the legality has had the upper hand despite the threats, even of death and even personal, that in these hours I am receiving on social and private only for having wanted the respect of the rules and the payment of a tax escaped and eluded. We all pay taxes: now we also adapt those who, until now, have earned millions of euros on an illicit trade to the detriment of the health (and pockets) of all of us. Would you allow your children to buy nicotine products without any control? And why should these gentlemen continue to evade taxes? The rules are the same for everyone. And from now on, finally, even for those who protest because of the cessation of an abusive, illegal and dangerous privilege. In the Commission we resolved, through an amendment signed by many political groups, the issue of the exit of children under 14 years of age from school, which emerged following a recent judgment of the Court of Cassation. In this respect, it is expected that parents can authorise school institutions to allow children to leave school premises independently, but also to allow them to take advantage of the school transport service operated by local authorities in an autonomous manner by means of a discharge which exempts school staff and the authorities themselves from any liability related to the fulfilment of supervisory obligations. Another very topical issue that we intend to resolve with this measure is the 28-day billing practice, which must be reformed for the purposes of consumer protection. This practice has been increasingly adopted in recent years by mobile and television operators and is also likely to spread through a sometimes misleading mechanism towards citizens. In this respect, a provision has been introduced which, even in line with the subsequent authority guidelines, provides for the return of billing on a monthly basis (or multiples of the month) with the sole exclusion, in the context of mobile telephony, of temporary promotional offers. It is also important to take a measure in favour of the future young entrepreneurs of the Mezzogiorno, because with the measure \"Resto al Sud\" we had foreseen that we could access this opportunity up to the limit of the compliment of the thirty-five years, but the longer times of the signing of the convention with Invitalia and the opening of the ban suggested to us to extend the possibility to those who had completed, on the date of approval of the norm, the thirty-fifth year of age, maintaining this term, therefore allowing also those who have exceeded that year to be able to access to this measure. Finally, I would like to focus on the principle of fair compensation. The introduction of fair compensation for the profession of lawyers already contains in itself the prospect of enlargement to other professional realities. In this way we have been able to respond to the demands that this sector has been making for a long time, determining a rule that we can consider the architrave of a system that in the future will be able to extend fair compensation to all professionals. We are confident that in the near future, starting with the draft budget law, some issues can be introduced into our system which, although widely shared, have not found room in the decree-law for tight deadlines, but will certainly find fertile ground in the budgetary maneuver. I refer to issues relating to the contributions of the self-employed to health care managed by bilateral bodies; to the question of socially useful workers (LSU) in some local authorities, to the development and support of caregivers\\' activities, to the extension of the integration fund and earnings in the fisheries sector. To conclude, we believe that the rules of the decree-law under discussion, strengthened with the precious contribution of Parliament, represent a further step towards the full recovery of our economic and productive system, a contribution to the protection of citizens and families and a decisive push towards a phase of structural growth of the country. The next budget law must be an opportunity to strengthen and consolidate these perspectives. For all these reasons, the Popular Alternative Group will vote strongly for the Government\\'s confidence in the measure under consideration, having strongly and in a determined way contributed to its improvement.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5550159811973572, 0.4449840188026428]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, Minister, I see that at last, after two years of sleepy and guilty expectation, something is moving, as if a whisper of pride has shaken our consciences. Without retracing the entire chronology of the story, now known to most, the current evolution, which still holds back in India our military, hostages of an aberrant international controversy, has now become a priority issue to be resolved as soon as possible, also and especially with reference to the approval of the decree that was very appropriately postponed yesterday, with the request to hear the Government (and thank you for its immediate presence in the Chamber). <p> Madam Minister, let us not hide our concern and dismay, first of all because of the statements of the UN Secretary-General, but also because of the decision of the Indian Supreme Court to call on the investigating judiciary to formulate, after two years of exhausting expectation, the accusations known to all. <p> We do not want to go into the matter of judicial matters, although we have no doubt about the accident, but it is really difficult for us to think that these two of our soldiers deliberately shot human figures, for no specific reason, in order to be guilty of a crime. So, if it is true that on the one hand - this must make us think - two innocent fishermen have lost their lives, on the other it is really difficult to doubt the chance of the accident. And anyway, for a story like this, the clues of guilt, waiting for the charges, certainly do not justify the kidnapping of our two soldiers in Indian land. <p> Therefore, I believe that Italy, and with it Europe and the international communities (because there is no doubt about the multilaterality of the problem, with good peace in Ban Ki-moon), must demand respect for international law and a rapid solution of the case, which is also requested by the ambassadors of the Member States of the European Union, the United States of America and the ambassador of the European Union, as well as by the members of a delegation of the various Italian parliamentary groups who, very appropriately, went to New Delhi at the end of January. <p> We hope that you, Madam Minister, have acquired the support and convergence necessary to internationalise this case. His statements today and what emerges from his clear report lead us to hope, given the opinion of the Italian Government on the statements of the UN Secretary-General and on the initiatives that are intended to be taken in the United Nations to support the Italian position and the further steps that the Government intends to take at European and multilateral level. The hope is that in Italy the line of firmness will come forward, because considering the two maroons as terrorists means to consider Italy itself a terrorist country, and it is unacceptable for Italy, but also for the Europe of which we are part. <p> In this context, I would like to highlight the important role that the Italian Parliament must play in raising awareness among the international community - this is what we are trying to do with your help - and in raising this issue with representatives of the European institutions and their counterparts from other countries. <p> The decision that the Indian public accuses, after two years of guilty silence, formally advanced to the Supreme Court of that country, that the charge of the two Italian military takes place under the assumption of the application of the anti-terrorism and anti-piracy legislation, is really unacceptable: it is, for Italy, a situation to say the least grotesque. The time has come to square around our Navy rifles. It is time to show the Indians and the international community that they are a united country. <p> It has been a long time, too long, and now we have to expect the results and the expected feedback of the international community to come. <p> We cannot be consoled by the fact that the European Union has made its voice heard on this matter, even if this is important and decisive. The President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, have expressed the EU's serious concerns about the matter, which is likely to have a negative impact on the EU's global efforts to combat piracy. Let us hope that this is a firm and concrete commitment and not mere formal statements. <p> The entire Italian Parliament follows the evolution of the affair with assiduousness and great concern, also in view of the serious consequences that could derive from this unfortunate precedent in terms of the certainty of international law and the effectiveness of the action given in support of peace and security through the instrument of international missions, to which Italy contributes with conviction. <p> For these reasons, the delegation of the Italian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees, representative of all political forces, was right at the end of January to go to Delhi, where it met the diplomatic representatives of some European countries, together with the head of the European Union delegation, renewing the readiness to start a channel of parliamentary diplomacy that helps to speed up the positive solution of the dispute even if, as is known, no representative of the Indian institutions had the courtesy and good sense to meet the delegation; an attitude, this of the Indian authorities, irritating, abusive and unacceptable closure to us. <p> We therefore feel the need to proceed without delay in compliance with international law and that the military should be assured of all the guarantees of the rule of law, starting from the possibility that they can immediately return to their country, taking into account that for two years they have been subject to a measure of restriction of personal freedom in the absence of a reliable head of attribution. <p> Therefore, Madam Minister, on behalf of the New Right Centre Group, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for your timely presence in this House and once again express the commitment of our parliamentarians and the readiness for any initiative that the Government intends to take to achieve a positive solution to the delicate issue, putting first the interest of the life and destiny of our sailors but, not least, the proud defence of the dignity of our nation and our noble tradition of commitment and distinction in international missions of peace.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5062013864517212, 0.4937986731529236]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, many Members have pointed out, with negative emphasis, that this is the eleventh decree-law that we are about to convert. <p> It seems to me that this observation bears witness to the commitment of the Government and Parliament to a very difficult and extremely complex affair. It was and is a matter of reconciling interests which are all worthy of protection: the right and interest to a healthy environment, the right to work, the national interest in maintaining production in a strategic sector such as the steel industry. <p> The Government has made this path, which is rugged and necessarily work in progress, inspired by the reasonable balance of these fundamental rights. This path was endorsed by the Constitutional Court with judgment No. 85 of 2013, which rejected and declared inadmissible the questions of constitutional legitimacy raised by the Taranto Public Prosecutor with reference to the second of the decrees-laws of this series, identifying precisely in the action of the Government this reasonable balance between interests and values all primary. Indeed, in the area of fundamental rights guaranteed by the first part of the Constitution, there is one that prevails over the other. Our task - of Parliament and the Government - is to protect, contemporaneize and balance them all. As the rapporteurs have clearly said, this measure is necessary, on the one hand, to respond to indications from the European Commission and, on the other hand, to facilitate the conclusion of this path with the transfer of the industrial complex to a group that fully resumes production activity and guarantees employment levels. The first objective responds to the shift in the extraordinary administration of the burden of repayment of the 300 million loan; the second objective responds, for example, to the possibility for tenderers to propose changes to the environmental plan. It is true that the environmental plan has been adapted to the best techniques available four years in advance: it entered into force throughout Europe in mid-2016, the environmental plan has been adapted to the technical ones already in 2012. We are in the field of technology, science and technology, and it is possible that better, more effective and perhaps less expensive solutions are proposed, which must be evaluated, as provided for in the Decree-Law, when assessing tenders by the Committee of Experts, before the successful tenderer is identified. This requirement is also met by the fact that everyone considers exemption and exclusion of criminal or administrative liability for acts that are implementing the environmental plan and not for an area of impunity. For the implementation of the environmental plan it is ensured that a formal violation does not give rise to seizures and does not result in further stops to the process of reorganization of that area and the resumption of the productive activity. I should like to conclude by saying that the Government is right to defend this sector and to set its feet in Europe by calling for a review of the rules on State aid to the steel industry. It makes me particularly aware that those who cry out every day against this Europe of constraints, dullness and limitations, then call back the infringement procedures that the European Union is operating against us when it comes to defending a national interest. <p> I'm gonna close it with one joke.

It does not appear to me, because from a more in-depth investigation, if it is true that in sub-Saharan Africa there are approximately (and by default) 39 million early and forced marriages, it is equally true that, in the light of other data, Europe is not exempt from the phenomenon: in Europe we have quantified about 12 million of them; even less are exempt the Middle East, with 18 million, Latin America and the Caribbean with 25 million and South Asia with over 32 million. <p> These are actually dramatic data that refer to cultural foundations, but I would not put the question in an exquisitely religious way, as they are divisive and conflictual, but according to a secular perspective: a secularity that makes us say that the fundamental rights that are not recognized and that are mortified and offended, have not only a place of religious order, but become the result of a culture in which some figures find themselves taking a subordinate position to others in the social order. I believe that this is the subject that must involve the Senate in the possible measures that will follow. <p> I was very impressed by the report, which was also evoked in previous speeches, edited by Save the Children, in which three types of freedom are mentioned in particular: the first form of freedom - recalling with this also Isaiah Berlin and his famous essay \"Two concepts of freedom\" - is the so-called negative freedom, which consists in freeing oneself from violence; Save the Children talks about free from Harm. But we are also talking about a positive freedom, because without freeing ourselves from violence we are not even free to live and open ourselves to information, culture and education. Hence, we move from freedom from violence to freedom to live: free to live - as Save the Children says - and free to learn, that is, free to access educational sources. I think that\\'s the main step. It is true, every time we discuss some issues, it is said that it is a subject of a cultural order: I agree that it is a topic of a cultural order, but a pre-political culture, which gives us the possibility, having outlined values and principles of reference, to truly combine politics with the common good. It\\'s not just a national problem. I am very pleased that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is present today, not only because of his competence on the subject and because of his personal sensitivity, also as an institutional representation, but also because of the fact that this is clearly an issue that must also affect diplomacy and contacts at international level. In fact, it is true that culture is affirmed through the affirmation of certain principles (the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Convention on the Rights of Children and Adolescence), but it is also true that the United Nations Human Rights Council itself adopted on 1 July 2015 the first resolution on early and forced marriages. We ourselves have, by virtue of the Council of Europe Convention, implemented a law in Italy which ratified the Convention signed in Istanbul on 11 May 2011. The passage that I would like to stress, however, is the following: the affirmation of principles and the recognition of rights are certainly fundamental, but they cannot be exhaustive, because the principles and values of reference must not be imposed by force, but transmitted through a diplomatic, cultural and economic procedure that ensures that, through social development, the right consequences can be drawn. One might immediately think that there is an obvious disparity between a dimension of freedom declined in some realities of the world and a freedom denied in other realities of the world. However, I would not like this positive freedom of some realities in the world to be transferred to others in the sense of imposition, in the sense of command, even with the same violence. I believe that this is an important aspect, because the educational process and the cultural dimension pass through the bodies at international level, but they must be transferred and made their own through a process that requires not only diplomacy but also proper contacts. In fact, slowly with progress and evolution there is also the reduction, if not the disappearance, of an extremely dramatic phenomenon. I believe that this is one of the most characteristic aspects of this issue. I wanted to sign this motion firmly - as I said at the beginning of my brief speech - because it outlines very precise points of a path that Parliament itself can take to completion or that, through other types of measures, can make it possible to achieve such a desired result. In fact, in this motion the Government is asked to take action, in international fora, in order to ensure full respect, by the signatory countries, of the Convention on the Rights of Childhood and Adolescence; to take all appropriate initiatives for the full implementation of the resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council, in the light of the serious violation of human rights, as well as of every principle of civilization, which involves the perpetuation of the practice of forced marriages; last, but not least, to evaluate in a synergistic exchange with Parliament the opportunity to equip Italy, in line with the virtuous example of Sweden (already mentioned), with a specific legislation, in order to configure as a new criminal case forced marriage and all related activities. Mr President, I only ask you for a few seconds, without going beyond the time I have been given. I would like to recall very briefly what Malala had to say in her speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony on 10 December 2014, at the age of just seventeen. There is a passage from his speech that I believe goes to nobly synthesize what I tried to pass on to colleagues: that it is the last time - as Malala says - that a child or a child spends their childhood in a factory, that it is the last time a child is forced to marry and that it is the last time an innocent child dies in war. What does that mean? It means that what we are dealing with today is one aspect, but it is not the only one, of all the violence and all the harassment (violence that is being administered), of all the marginality and all the abandonment that are the responsibility of adolescents and children. It is therefore a problem that involves us and makes Malala herself say: that this is the last time a class remains empty and that it is the last time a child is told that education is a crime and not a right.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7195730209350586, 0.2804270088672638]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> D\\'ADDA (<PARTY>). Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this speech at the end of the sitting, today, in the Senate, a relay with which, together with many senators and many senators, we remember every woman who is killed at the hands of a man to whom she is or has been linked by a loving relationship. We will do so as long as it is necessary to remind Parliament and our country of the urgency of combating violence against women. Last week, in Busto Arsizio, my city, Diana Vrapi Koni was stabbed by her husband. I dedicate this intervention to you. But again: In Vergiate, in the province of Varese, last May 27, Renata Ottone, fifty-seven years old, was suffocated with a pillow by her husband, who then committed suicide. In Segrate, in the province of Milan, on 26 May, Antonietta di Nunno, a 35-year-old woman, was shot dead by her ex, who then committed suicide in turn. The two were breaking up, and they had four kids. Yesterday, in Venice, Anastasia Sharukova was killed, along with her current companion, who, among other things, probably comes from my province, from her ex. <p> D\\'ADDA (<PARTY>). Thank you, Madam President. It is no accident that this call comes from a woman. I was reporting the case of a young woman killed with her new partner, by her ex-boyfriend. Today we also learned that the poor girl was pregnant. This brings up to 61 the women we remember in our journey, which began only on June 30, 2016. And they would have been even more if, in Sanremo, two weeks ago, a 13-year-old girl had not managed to save her mother in extremis, to whom her father had set fire. The data presented by ISTAT at the end of March at the conference \"Violence on women: the data and tools for assessing gender violence\" tell us that feminicide is only the tip of the iceberg of male violence against women. In Italy there are more than 8.3 million women victims of psychological violence; 4.5 million women who have suffered, throughout their lives, degrading and humiliating sexual acts, unwanted and suffered relationships such as violence, abuse or serious physical sexual harassment, such as rapes (653,000) and attempted rapes (746,000). 20.2 percent of women between the ages of sixteen and seventy (4.3 million) were instead victims of physical violence, threats, slaps, fists or kicks. In a minority of cases, 1.5 percent, these violence has led to serious and permanent damage, by strangulation, burn or suffocation. Let us make our appeal with conviction. It is an appeal to the Government all and to the Undersecretary with delegation to equal opportunities: the directing booth monitors the application, the merits and the limits of Law No 119 of 2013, and above all give full and accurate implementation to the plan against violence. We need resources, we need research into causes, we need training. We need a strong commitment. Many of the women killed were mothers or, as in the case of this poor woman, were to become mothers. As estimated by the Switch-off project, presented in recent months to the House, it is estimated that over the last ten years there have been at least 1,600 children and children orphaned by mother or both parents if the feminicide followed the author\\'s suicide. A drama in the drama. And again, an appeal to the media: stop justifying, even with the wrong language, the murderers and to blame women, even when they seem to defend their executioners. In a local newspaper in the Province of Varese, the expression \"drama of passion\" has appeared again. There is no passion if you watch for endless minutes, even twenty minutes, a woman who dies because you strangle her. There is only the darkness of an unspeakable horror. An appeal to the country, to men and women: more than 120 women were killed in 2016 and over 21 in this 2017. By the way, 2016 is a year when the other murders have dropped. Violence against women is as ancient as the world, but today we want to strongly hope that an advanced, civil and democratic society will no longer feed on reports of abuse, murder and rape. We do not want, we can no longer accept this madness that challenges us, calls us or rather cries out to our consciences of people and legislators, every time wondering if this step of deliveries will ever end and every time continuing it not to forget, as today.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7559528350830078, 0.2440471053123474]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> ANGIONES (<PARTY>).

For all that concerns the circumstance that finally in Italy you return to have the contract indefinitely as a reference contract, I believe that the data, however imaginatively they can be read, tell us that we are on the right track.

I know for a fact that in several regions, including mine, progress has been made in the Ministry-Region agreements, especially on the issues of active policies.

Mr President, senators and senators, I take the floor to explain my disagreement with the Group's choice and my lack of participation in the vote of confidence. I felt that the draft law on civil unions had its inspiring motive and its deepest content and its most authentic sense in the reference to the principle of non-discrimination. But now, with the deletion of Article 5, I believe that a very serious inequality factor has been introduced in that legislation; an inequality, not only and not so much between heterosexual couples and homosexual couples, but, in particular, between children intended for adoption by heterosexual couples and children intended for adoption by homosexual couples. Behind this choice, I believe a logic and a cultural approach that intends to deny the moral instance that exists, that may exist, in the demand for civil union, which aims to neutralize the social and ethical value of that same civil union and reduce it to a mere private contract. And there is a perspective, which I would call economics, which offers a sort of exchange between concessions of certain property guarantees, hereditary, social security, fiscal and administrative in exchange for the waiver of the legal and moral recognition of civil union. But it is precisely that moral legal recognition of civil union that constitutes the beating heart of the issue and its ultimate and highest sense. I think that behind the public debate on rights there is another great issue, even more important and delicate, and it is the question of the dignity of the person and the homosexual person. Well, dignity is not, cannot be, partial, intermittent and dimiditated. Dignity is or is not. <p> In this bill, dignity appears, but it is not adequately recognized and is not adequately legitimized. For this reason, I do not support the bill in this new version and I do not participate in the vote of confidence, aware that the path to the conquest of the rights of homosexual people is just beginning.

After spending many days evaluating texts, voting on some, and others not, we acquire a large amendment which, as you yourself said, is the result of a series of texts of amendments voted on, of amendments proposed by the Government and voted on and of amendments proposed by the Government and the rapporteurs, tabled but also not voted on. It is a full-bodied work, therefore, which is reduced in this major amendment which rewrites the whole text, with a technical report which is the most important part that the Budget Commission has to examine, evaluate and acquiesce from the political point of view. As President Azzollini said earlier in the euphemistic way, it is at least a text that can be referred to a few days ago, while the texts of parliamentary initiative were still being voted on and not the amendments of the Government, which on the contrary are the most full-bodied part, together with those of the rapporteurs, of the text on which the question of trust has been raised today. This text, Mr President, for the first time in my modest parliamentary experience, the one on which there is the boiling of the General Accounting of the State, reports - and should not have - even the numbers of parliamentary amendments deposited and then discussed in the Budget Committee, together with the notes, and the missing parts. We, therefore, in the technical report accompanying the maxi amendment on which the question of trust is raised, read - for example - on Amendment 3.42 (text 2), the words: \"Feel Riccardi\" as if this were a usual formula in a technical report. I would point this out to Mr Saccomanni. I was sorry to mention it to Deputy Minister Fassina.

I shall therefore confine myself to concluding my speech by pointing out that it is in your responsibility, Mr President, to verify that the report and the maxi amendment are absolutely corresponding. We have not been able to verify this since the speedy reading we have done - perhaps too quickly - because, given the many errors found, it would have been necessary to have the opportunity to make a more detailed one; there is even a lack of texts and amendments from the Government presented to the Commission, which are not then evaluated by the technical report provided kindly by the Ministry of Economy and the General Accounting of the State. I believe that this law of stability deserves to be evaluated in a better and better way in all its parts. This falls within your responsibility, Mr President, and I hope that you will reassure the whole House that we are voting on a correct text not so much and not only in its drafting, on which we may even fly, given the speed and haste with which we have worked, but also in those very important financial effects on the public financial balances that the law of stability determines.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5041850209236145, 0.4958149790763855]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, as Mrs Lo Moro has done, ask for permission to submit the written report, and I do not want to speak at this stage. <p> CARDIELLO, rapporteur.

Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Subsecretaria for her answer, which I consider to be comprehensive and of which I am immediately satisfied, starting with the final outcome of the Government's intervention, and throughout the penitentiary administration, which has remedied a situation which was very critical and problematic. I am particularly pleased because it was an organic intervention of the public administration, central, regional and local levels, and because although the only painful note could be given by the timing and distance of today's response to my act of inspection union of 7 April 2016, which might suggest that there has been an excessive delay, in fact, the complexity of the problem took time and, rightly, caution them. I can therefore define the intervention as a whole as a matter of urgency, although the response may appear to be delayed and, as far as we have achieved it, even balanced; in fact, it has been reflected in the complaints made by the guarantor of the rights of the persons detained, who have then also found an effective response in the administrative inspection - which we now learn has been carried out - and through the requirements that have been extended at regional level. It seems to me that this is an example, as I said, of organicity, timeliness and balance, but above all of efficiency. Sorry that at the public level only today you can know how positive it has been done. Probably this delay in time was necessary for the sensitivity and confidentiality with which certain investigations must be carried out, so that they could be carried out with the necessary scrupulousness. I believe that if the government's action is still to be integrated, perhaps the requirements referred to in its response could be made public so that, in addition to the government's authoritative opinion on the full satisfaction that these prescriptions have found within the prison administration, there can also be a public audit, as well as the new guarantor and the municipal administration itself that is mentioned by the prescriptions that have been indicated. I agree with the view that this matter, which has been successfully resolved, contributes positively to teaching at national level about the importance of the figure of the guarantor of the rights of prisoners. In this case, we have proof of how the interaction between the prison administration and the guarantor can lead to significant improvements. Even what the government has announced seems to me to be very positive. At this point I would simply like to thank the guarantor, who allowed this to emerge with his letter of resignation and the denunciation of what, from his point of view, was incorrect.

In principle, I find it difficult, although I have listened carefully to Mr Casini, to imagine the ratification of this accession to NATO as a moment of protagonism on the part of our country and our Parliament. The issue is central and it is not simply a question of an anachronistic debate between Atlanticists and anti-Atlanticists. It is clear that the Atlantic Alliance has changed its mission and it is not always possible to read as a defensive alliance. At this time, we should never, in any case, debate on those who believe that a solution should be sought, with force, to the many outbreaks that have ignited in the relations between NATO and the Russian Federation, in particular in the context of the scenarios in which these frictions have developed, which are not only the recent maneuvers in Lithuania: the main problem is how we must regulate ourselves in the relationship with the Russian Federation, also in relation to the more complex affair that is unfolding in Syria and in the fight against terrorism. From this point of view, I believe that no one in this House can convince us that the accession of the Republic of Montenegro to NATO is a significant fact at the military level. I doubt that Montenegro's contingents can enrich the persuasive and deterrent capacity of the military alliance. I believe that this is a political decision, which falls at a precise political moment and which risks intensifying a well-defined and determined political tension that is going through our international relations system. I think we need to report an inconvenience. Madam President, I have honestly never believed that we could be Atlanticists or anti-Atlanticists like we are from a football team to a derby: from Rome or Lazio. Atlanticism has played a very precise role in the stabilisation of post-war Europe. It was a bit difficult, perhaps, to be atlant in absolute after Cermis and after Ustica. It is a system of alliances that has carried out its historical function, but today we are in a different historical moment and - lively! - we have the opportunity to compete, deepening all the issues, so that this new course will see us, not say protagonists, but at least co-protagonists in deciding who are the friends and enemies of the moment in the face of the challenge of terrorism. I don't think it was an emphasis to remember the spirit of Sea Practice. The key to international relations, which can lead us to arrive at a more choral response to the great challenges that come at this time from the great crisis that unfortunately goes from Turkey to Libya, passes through that spirit.

This means not only all the borders of the Soviet Union (i.e. Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltic States and Georgia), but, if we know history, also the Tsarist borders (including Finland) and part of Poland (including Warsaw). It is clear that Finland has been concerned and asks to join NATO and that Eastern Europe too is concerned because Putin has stated that he has aims on it. <p> Our concerns, however, do not end here, because the Russian institutions have finally explained what they intend to denazize Ukraine. They explained to us that Ukraine does not exist, there is no Ukrainian nation, there is no Ukrainian people, there is no Ukrainian language. But Nazi propaganda, from 1990 onwards, has created an anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalism and, therefore, now Russia with its \"special operation\" must re-educate the Ukrainians and make them understand that they do not exist and that they are Russian. Now, to us who are Westerners this seems absurd, but to those who have grown up in communist regimes and are very familiar with rehabilitation centers, all this seems normal and goes in that direction. <p> I am sorry to have to waste minutes to eliminate some fake news that runs on our media, but unfortunately also within Parliament. The war would be waged to stop the genocide in Donbass: this is a Russian fake news repeated in Italy and also in Parliament. Beyond the matter that the Donbass is not Russian because, given to the hand, 40 percent of the Donbass is inhabited by Russians, the official numbers are the following and I challenge the Italian who usually watches our television to have this perception: the civilian deaths in Donbass in 2021 were 25; in 2020 the civilian deaths were 26; in 2019 they were 27. So no genocide in progress and no genocide to stop. Where do the 14,000 deaths we hear about come from? These are mainly Ukrainian and pro-Russian fighters involved in the Russian invasion of the Donbass, in a scheme we know and which Russia systematically repeats, that is, creating conflict zones in the states it claims: it applies to Transnistria in Moldova, Abkhazia, South Ossetia in Georgia, Donbass in Ukraine. Russia simply wants domination over the territories it claims, including Ukraine. The problem is that the other states do not agree with Russia; they disagree because Russia is not an attractive state. Russia is a poor state and has a lower GDP than Italy, despite having 145 million inhabitants. It is a country that produces nothing and exports only raw materials like a third world country. It is a country with huge income disparities, with enormous corruption, where Putin and his hierarchies show a billionaire wealth that is not well known where it comes from, while 20 million Russians do not even have a bath in the house. This is Russia and it is no wonder that Ukraine, like the rest of Eastern Europe, looks to the West and not to Russia. But Russia, instead of wondering why, decides to intervene with tanks. Luckily, Ukraine resisted this invasion, which according to any military analyst was to last a few days. Russia has invaded Ukraine and Ukraine has amazed the world with a resistance that has never been seen before, without the weapons it needs. Also this lie, repeated by certain journalists - I do not know whether because paid by the Kremlin or because in bad faith - and by certain political forces, according to which Ukraine has already been sufficiently armed, is denied by military analysts. The Ukrainians fight with a piece of artillery every wind in possession of the Russians and with less range and less fire capacity. Resistance is only due to the heroism of that people. Ukraine is experiencing its Risorgimento, fighting for its freedom and independence. And we Italians, that the Risorgimento lived it and that we transformed what others called only a geographical expression in our homeland, should have an empathy towards that people and its Risorgimento. But political choices are made not with empathy, but with reason. And the reason why we must support Ukraine has already explained to us the president of <PARTY> Giorgia Meloni, and it is very simple, because there lies the Italian national interest. First, Putin\\'s statements are already very clear: if Ukraine capitulates quickly, then it will be up to other European countries and to us as Brothers of Italy would not like the return of Soviet imperialism even in the third millennium. Secondly, very pragmatically, it is not Italy that decides the fate of the war in Ukraine; there is a surreal debate, as if the Italian weapons were fundamental to decide whether Ukraine can resist or not. Well, even if Italy were to betray its international alliances, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Japan, all the rest of the West would continue to defend Ukraine. <p> It would not change, therefore, the fate of the war, but would change the image and credibility of Italy in the world, making it fall back into that image of a country that is not reliable, as it has often been painted. <p> Brothers of Italy is the movement of Italian patriots: we make our decisions always and only in the interest of the nation.

Madam President, I would like to point out here something that has been reported to me about the lack of transparency in the judicial auctions currently taking place in my Province. I welcome the call that has been made to me and I ask the attention of the competent authorities to ensure that they monitor and ascertain the situation. All this comes back to the moment of serious economic crisis that the whole country is experiencing, especially in the South and in my Province. As you will recall, in this House we talked about the desperate case of a gentleman in the city of Victoria who killed himself precisely because he was deprived of his home, who had not managed to finish paying. On that occasion also a representative of the Forces of the Order was wounded in an attempt to save him. Now another event is happening: a separate woman, with two dependent minors, will be deprived of her home, because she will undergo the executive eviction next Thursday, just because she failed to complete the payment of the mortgage. I was told that his house, which he had bought with his husband from whom he separated, was sold for very little money compared to his value and that the lady had to extinguish by now only a small sum. This news creates discomfort and throws families into despair. I repeat, it is a single woman with two dependent children, who, although that is her only home and her children are minor, is evicted. I therefore call on the competent authorities to ensure that this does not happen again, in order to preserve, first of all, the serenity of children and families who experience deep anxiety and concern, risk ever more dramatic consequences and to live traumas that will certainly have repercussions in their lives.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6344510912895203, 0.36554887890815735]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> DEL BARBA (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft law we are about to vote on is very simple, as Senator Bernini reminded us, namely to strengthen the staff of the Commission to guarantee the statutes for the transparency and control of political party statements. It does so with three articles that have been discussed in Parliament since 13 February 2015. It does so by intervening on a concrete situation that sees the 2013 budgets of the parties, certified with the same criteria as the companies that are admitted on the stock exchange, deposited with the Commission with all the supporting pieces in support of each item and until now not examined. It does so at the request of the President of the Guarantee Commission himself, as was mentioned earlier, by intervening to make finally operational what the law already has. At last, they are simply assigned with secondment of five staff units, employees of the Court of Auditors, to be applied to the audit activities and two additional units of staff, dependent on other public administrations, to be applied in the audit activities, all with the appropriate professional competence, to examine the statements of political parties according to the legal dictates. In the absence of such staff, the Commission is not in a position to carry out its mandate in full. Therefore the measure, contrary to what is supported by the 5 Star Movement and by those who are actively opposed to it, is aimed precisely at an effective and full control of regularity with reference to the statements of political parties. In absurd terms, those who are against this measure do not want the Guarantee Commission to function and the party\\'s statements to be verified. <p> For these simple reasons the Democratic Party will vote in favour of the measure. <p> That, Mr President, should end here the explanation of vote on a measure which is so simple, so obvious, as complementary and consistent with what is already laid down in the law. Instead, it is necessary to participate all together in this great fiction that someone thinks they can assemble and disassemble at will whenever you touch on the issue of financing parties or other subject that is considered sufficiently interesting and manipulatable. A fiction that includes predictable and repetitive scripts, staged also rather worn and stale and above all prescribes the total mystification of reality. <p> A fiction in which one has the claim that we ourselves act as protagonists and appeared more or less aware, even in these classrooms. We go so far as to ask the Presidency to act as a director\\'s help <p> : Open the microphone, give me the camera, give me the floor, take this launch of Rules of Procedure in the air <p> , to invite the press present in the Chamber to report what has just been said, immortalize the picture indicated; they will excuse the photographers if I do not turn, but I prefer to speak to the Presidency and to the entire Chamber. <p> What does it matter if everything is completely destitute of foundation? <p> It is truly a great innovation, the one that is proposed by the 5 Star Movement: it would move from the theater of politics to the great reality of politics, all for the great show of the network or supposedly such. Yes, beautiful the net, we like; beautiful participation; beautiful the new policy that we all want to build; but what need do we have - you have - to introduce into all this the evil seed of lies and mystification? I assure you that citizens are more mature than that, they love the truth more than the spectacle of trumpets and spinning stars. <p> So let\\'s tell it, for once, this truth, President. Perhaps it is too simple and boring, as I mentioned in my introduction. If it\\'s necessary, how\\'s it going today, let\\'s build a compelling narrative, look for a crime, a misdemeanor, and go after the culprit: do you want to see that those smart parties have hidden budgets or have not complied with any legal provisions?

I invite everyone to check out what I\\'m saying by going to our site and looking in the appropriate section. Do you want to see, then, that the parties are trying to avoid controls?

Not even this plot can be cooked. So what do we do? How do we build this reality show? However, there is talk of money at parties: let\\'s mount the mud machine, something will happen. LUCIDES (<PARTY>). Turn off the TV! DEL BARBA (<PARTY>). Sometimes, ladies and gentlemen, turning the spotlight on reality can be uncomfortable for those who do it. With regard to the financing of parties, we are proud to be those who have cancelled public funding through electoral refunds, establishing a transparent and voluntary form of participation in the democratic life of the country and of funding to parties through the mechanism of 2 per thousand. <p> It wasn\\'t easy and in fact he feared it wouldn\\'t work. <p> AIROLA (<PARTY>).

You test!! DEL BARBA (<PARTY>). ...but I am a living part of our country\\'s democratic life and this will always see us working to find the most balanced and acceptable solution for our democracy. <p> We have made the issue of money in politics and in family and public institutions, competing at every level so that the principle of transparency is ultimately the main guarantee for each citizen. <p> LUCIDES (<PARTY>). Shame on you! DEL BARBA (<PARTY>). There is still a long way to go on this issue and we will do it with the step of those who have the responsibility to open the track, as we have done so far. This is what the spotlight shows: our perseverance, transparency, and I do not hesitate to use the word courage. <p> In this new path we do not want to escape - and I conclude, Mr President - as a Democratic Party, from the proper controls, and for this reason we want to strengthen the structure of the Commission to guarantee the statutes and for the transparency and control of the statements of political parties. <p> So, how do we sell this reality show? Where do we find the culprit if he\\'s not the butler this time? There will be at least a few tricks of the law which, finally, has not been respected. Well, yes, there\\'s a cow in the hallway, a huge cow looking nicely at us. <p> while all of us - or maybe just some of us - try to get away from him by pretending not to see him. It is the total lack of transparency of the 5 Star Movement <p> only that it has not submitted budgets <p> , only to have no right even from the start to the electoral refunds, only to have violated the law that we are going to amend as indicated today. <p> Today politics needs transparency and courageous choices, like the ones we voted yesterday to suppress the Senate... <p> MORONESE (<PARTY>).

Our rich cultural world has long been in need of a reform of the complex legislative provisions on the organization and management of lyrical-symphonic foundations. <p> The current discipline on theatre, prose, music, dance, traveling performances and circus activities was revised and rationalised, renewing the legislative provisions through the drafting of a single normative text called the code of the show. In fact, the entertainment code streamlines and simplifies administrative procedures, rationalises expenditure and encourages the improvement of the artistic and cultural quality of activities, as well as the use by the community. <p> The world of live entertainment was therefore suffering from the lack of adequate standards, adequate resources, adequate and forward-looking vision, both European and international. Today, as Senator Di Giorgi noted in her report, we are facing organic reform. <p> In recent months the numerous hearings of the 7th Commission have brought to light problems, limitations and difficulties for the entertainment workers. Many have been the testimonies of organizations, groups of professionals and associations that have asked - and to this the bill has given answer - promotion and support to the various worlds of the show and to the various artistic expressions, considered indispensable to the development of our culture and to the cohesion of our identity, to the spread and promotion of European and international our art, vehicle of our tourist offer. The live performance is, however, also a fundamental educational occasion and - as I have just said - a contrast to situations of psychological and social distress, present in the whole and varied world of the school. It is also an occasion for the integration of people with difficulties and disabilities, but also and above all for the enhancement of talents. It is not by chance expected that the activities of the show will be carried out with the direct involvement of young people from childhood and that a percentage of the flows will be destined to activities in the school; this will seal the educational, educational and social value of the show, a value sustained by all means. <p> All performers should also be supported and, therefore, significant compensation is needed. It is well known that the rewards in the entertainment world are modest because of the modest contractual capacity of those who devote themselves to such activity. It is necessary, however, to find greater recognition. And the effort in this regard on the various sectors of the show has been and will be addressed during the examination of the delegation at work. <p> Some of the problems highlighted by the associations have highlighted the criticalities of the social security system. In particular, the musicians have invoked measures to overcome the criticalities of some complex regulations on work that determine the consequent submerged; social security regulations; excessive costs of Siae tariffs and the insuperable economic problems of music schools. <p> Finally, with this measure, we will be able to give to the artistic professionalism of theaters, dance, music, opera, concert and choral activities, circus activities, traveling performances, historical carnivals, historical re-enactments, but also of the band complexes, street artists, theatre for children, and many other contributions, of the important tools of public support and development that enhance the quality of the offer and productions, the plurality and peculiarity of the languages of art. We will be able to promote the dissemination of the Italian show abroad, with attention to everyone, but specifically to young artists, as the rapporteur has already pointed out. Finally, generational replacement will be promoted in order to enhance new talents and attention to new technologies. <p> The drafting of a normative text, the code of the show, will therefore give greater effectiveness and organicity both to administrative procedures, and to the artistic-cultural quality of the productions, encouraging innovation, rationalizing and strengthening the interventions of support of the State. It is important that actions be harmonised with those of local authorities through programme agreements. <p> Finally, I would like to stress how much this complex legislative process, carefully followed by the Commission and closely related by the rapporteur, has been attentive to the enhancement of the enormous heritage of our show, the works of young emerging artists, thanks also to spaces dedicated to television platforms and the production of our works in Europe and around the world. Young artists in particular, but also other workers in the sector, will be able to access facilitation measures through facilitated credit instruments. As far as the criteria for allocating the Single Fund for entertainment are concerned, I would stress the central importance of the provision of contributions which enhance the quality of production and, therefore, the selective financing of projects by young people under the age of thirty-five. <p> I do not want to repeat what has already been said, but I will just mention the territorial rebalancing: the regions affected by the earthquake will be able to make use of important funding. <p> Finally, the Show Board aims to provide support tasks and policy proposals for the sector, to ensure analysis, monitoring and evaluation of public policies on the subject. <p> I conclude by expressing a lively satisfaction for the realization of an important result, which will see the increase of the resources of the FUS, the establishment of strong collaborations with the world of the school, the extension of the art bonus to the whole world of the show, the legal recognition to many events that were not recognized before.

Madam President, in a brief speech I confirm the support of the parliamentary group to which I belong on the motions for resolutions before the Senate today. In particular, however, I must add a few more elements to the motion for a resolution on the Sicilian region, precisely because of some of the arguments that have been developed in this House by some of my previous colleagues. In Sicily we must register a system whose faults and responsibilities are not objectively attributable only to those who today have the political leadership of the Region; there is a sum of errors and difficulties, which have created, among themselves, a sort of synergy to be strengthened, which has exploded in recent years. If anything, the main fault of President Crocetta, who today is the political leader of the Region, is that he has not assumed in first person, from the first moment, the direct responsibility of the entire sector, instead entrusting it to councillors who, then, have demonstrated neither the abilities, nor, above all, in my opinion, the balance in order to try to reverse the course in such a disastrous situation. In this confused situation, I would like to disagree completely with the intervention that I have heard, explained by the colleague of the League here, because the only positive element is the attempt of the Ministry of the Environment, which for a year now, through the preventive concert, has determined absolutely precise and restricted orders that do not allow any discretion neither to the Region, nor to the operators of the system, whether public or private, and in any case established rules. However, in recent months there has been a positive figure, namely the increase in separate collection and the decrease in volumes treated. These are undeniable data. I am convinced that this direction must see - as I said in my previous speech - an even stronger responsibility of the national government and the Ministry of the Environment. I was hoping that the government representative would listen to my speech and perhaps respond to it in response; however, strong for our reasons, we will continue to support them in all fora. To conclude, the Sicilian situation is a very difficult one, which, as I said, stratifies inefficiencies and sometimes bad things for decades. It is clear that it is not all inefficiency and evil; there are leopard-stained situations, but, precisely for this reason, the data of the report today at our examination basically constitute a good basis for study, verification and verification and I believe that - lively - the responsible bodies, in particular the prosecutors of the Republic, who can institutionally intervene in this field, from there can draw a series of absolutely dirigent evaluations.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6150730848312378, 0.3849269151687622]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> AUGELLO (<PARTY>). Mr President, unfortunately, in this explanation of vote I will have to repeat what I said in the explanation of vote given in Junta. The fundamental question that we raised, both in the Junta and in this House, has not only been eluded, but has also been refuted by denying the evidence of the cards. I repeat this for the last time, and I hope that colleagues will pay attention to me. It is not my opinion, Senator Cucca and rapporteur Stefano, that Mr Paolo Caponera, and not Mr Rosario Caponera, was at that meeting. It is written on page 11 of Mr. Aiello's questioning of 30 October 2014. It is written, and we cannot say: the Caponera, half Caponera, two Caponera and a half. Mr. Paolo Caponera was there, says the Witness Aiello on page 11 of the interrogation. This questioning is on the record of the Council but, unfortunately, I cannot distribute it, Mr President, because you know that the acts are secreted. But it is in Junta, and we cannot deny the evidence of what is transmitted to us by a proxy, in this case to say the least fearful. The fact that, rapporteur Stefano, there is an inaccuracy in defining the date of that meeting, always by this Mr Aiello, is nevertheless enclosed in a temporal indication that is also logical. Aiello says that the meeting took place, however, either in 2006 or 2007. And for what reason? Because they're making an agreement, even of an electoral nature. Now, colleagues in the Senate, each of us has taken, obviously not with criminals, but with party colleagues, electoral agreements. Is there anyone in this House who makes electoral agreements four years before the elections? Seriously we want to tell ourselves that we have this doubt, in front of the cards available to us in Junta and that we can all read? In this case it is evident that the fumus is there. We could have deepened this but, Mr President, unfortunately you did not give us the time, as President Stefano did not give us the time. It is implausible, completely, that the prosecutor who sent us these papers could be unaware of the time when he was in detention one of the main criminals at the center of this investigation. Mr President, from the very top of your experience, I would like to give you this example. Do you think Dr. Pignatone in Rome could have built the accusatory facility of Mafia capital if the meetings rebuked by the politicians, the cooperatives of Buzzi and Carminati had all historically taken place during the period when Carminati was in prison? If you had been the prosecutor of the Republic of Rome and a deputy of yours had brought you such information, you, despite the normally mild and compassionate air you always had, would have yielded to a moment of impatience. Or so I suppose. From this point of view, the question that we must examine is not to give in to the prejudice of the bad faith of the proxy or to the prejudice of inaccuracy or lack of ability to connect the documents of the proxy with each other. We must recognize that there is a fumus, because we are talking about a totally unreliable witness and a news that has not been communicated to us by the prosecutor. The prosecutor has communicated to us a whole series of interceptions, reports, etc. and has not communicated to us an essential news: that when that fact took place, where the electoral pact (the electoral criminal pact) was sealed, unfortunately the main criminal was not there. From this point of view, seriously asserting that this is a question that we put in a corner and proceed because there are so many others (of course there are only others), but in the light of this, the others should also be the subject of a more careful check, but it is not our task. On the other hand, it is our duty to say that there is fumus, because the prosecutor has not sent us sufficiently documented documents to allow us to judge the request that was submitted to us. This is the job the Junta should have done. However, because we have not been allowed to do this in depth, because we have been forced to get angry in this House to quote the pages of the acts that have been transmitted to us, because in Junta, with the acts in hand, we have not had the opportunity to have this debate, we are not in a position to endorse this procedure. I personally refuse to endorse procedures of this kind to put a person in jail. That's not a possible attitude. So I will personally repeat what I have already done in the Junta, that is, I will abstain in protest, I will vote abstention in protest, because I have not been able to do my job in the Junta of elections and parliamentary immunity. With regard to the Group as a whole, I believe with great balance (because on these things I believe that all the Groups should behave like this), our Parent gave us the mandate and the possibility to vote according to conscience. I would like this to happen throughout the Senate Assembly, in all the Groups, possibly using those nervations of consciousness that do not stop at the forearm, but arrive up to the fingertip when you have to press the button to decide what to do and to what destiny to entrust a Member of Parliament of the Republic\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.541262149810791, 0.4587378203868866]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> <PARTY>AVONE (<PARTY>). Madam President, first of all, as a member of the Education Commission, I would like to thank Minister Franceschini for his constant presence in the Commission and for the institutional style with which he has continued to follow the work of this House. I would also like to thank President Marcucci, the excellent President of the Commission, who has always been a super-partisan and very good at managing the moments of political tension that have gone through the work of the Commission, with an intelligent and flexible activity, which has, however, allowed the maximum usefulness of the work. Thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Di Giorgi, and to Commission officials. We listened in more than one intervention to the passionate tones with which we wanted to emphasize what is the richest heritage of our country, a deposit of great cultural richness. Just think of the 3,609 museums, the nearly 5,000 cultural sites between monuments and archaeological areas, the more than 46,000 tied architectural assets, the 49 UNESCO sites: a heritage of tangible goods and intangible traditions, which is the most precious thing we have. I would add what we have in Sicily, about 111 sites, which make the vast majority of the assets, 46 percent, to be found in the Centre-South. If that is true, it is just as well known that it is not enough to possess this enormous wealth of cultural goods to automatically attract a demand for cultural consumption. In fact, our territory has been characterized over time by numerous, too many archaeological, artistic and maintenance emergencies, which have brought a huge damage to our capacity for tourist-cultural attraction. From recent data, it appears that Italy, once an undisputed world leader for international tourist arrivals, has lost huge slices of the market and when tourism grows from us, this growth is however lower than that recorded in foreign countries. However, the tourism sector is a key sector of our economy, accounting for 10% of GDP. Inside, cultural tourism employs more than 2 million people and the cultural sector alone produces about 5% of GDP and employs more than 1.5 million people. So the government, as the good rapporteur pointed out this morning, is doing well to link these two sectors, tourism and culture, and to predict their growth through coordinated policies that are part of a single great strategy of development and exploitation. In recent years, we have seen a characterisation of public intervention in the cultural field, aimed mainly at putting conservation policies in place, rather than culture production policies. And, in fact, this approach is still a little affected by the decree that comes to our attention today, while for the future I trust in the commitment and passion shown by Minister Franceschini so that this report can be overturned. Today, in fact, under the devastating influences of the crisis, the only conservative moment cannot suffice, even if this certainly means protecting and subtracting our heritage from commodification and defending the territories from the impoverishment and logic of negative exploitation, because preserving without valorization would certainly not be a sign of progress: preserving without well managing the cultural heritage would only be a regression. That is why I feel like stressing here the best attitude that we must take, which is that of the production of culture, that is to help the creation of new expressions of art both in tangible forms, such as museums, monumental complexes, archives, sites and archaeological finds or libraries, both in intangible forms, such as music, especially by promoting access to culture through new technologies in every form of expression. Innovation, the creation of new skills and the intensive use of the most advanced technologies can generate new models for the development of the cultural sector and generate economic well-being for the community. The central hub that allows cultural goods to enter the great world of advanced technologies is basically that of digitization, i.e. the transformation of a monument, a painting, a sculpture in an electronically transferable and usable file, albeit with the limits and approximation that belong to a virtual use of the good and yet fundamental to increase its knowledge. Now, of course, conservation is the prerequisite for good cultural production, but the supply chain of a cultural asset is a concept of economic policy, which tends to give prominence to many other actors, both public and private, declining roles and tasks. And it seems to me that in this decree, where the conservative outlook, as I said, still seems to prevail over the productive one, we see, as well as in the words of the Minister, new interesting instruments: from patronage in a modern way, to the provision of tax credits for those who work liberal donations in favour of the support of places of culture or for maintenance. However, these instruments seem to us to be a positive step, but only a first step in relation to the needs of the globalisation of the world of culture. For example, the decree does not take sufficient account of the training processes, given that the increase in the quality of academies, as well as public and private programmes for art and creativity, is a heavy task that politics has often neglected gently. But the stage of the production of culture cannot be without the ideas of the artists, with respect to whom the organizational structures, even expensive (I want to remember the theatres and the film industry), are a fundamental instrument of promotion. At these stages it is important for the public and private sectors to meet, for the State to do more to make the private sector more generous, to redefine in detail the tasks and the ground on which cooperation can be made at a higher level, also in order to combine culture and tourism more effectively. Today various scholars raise their voices of this relationship between culture and tourism to say that the model of mere conservation, although important, is outdated because this model would create limited synergies with a few other sectors of the economy, and among these, precisely, tourism; we refer in particular to the small restoration company, to the small building company, to the computer companies specialized in cataloguing, to the specialized publishing. The cultural good is above all an indication of an identity, a sign of a path of civilization that must belong with full consciousness to the territorial community. Trust has been placed on this decree; it is a pity, because it is a good start and already only the passionate work of the Minister would have deserved generous and convinced support from each of us.

I would like to remind you that Banco Santander in Spain has acquired Banco popular español for one euro, taking charge of 7 billion euros of adjustments on the credit portfolio, thus avoiding an extended bail and bankruptcy. The Italian State - as it has already happened - intervenes late, procrastinating the solution of problems and systemic initiatives, and intervenes only now to offer Banca Intesa the jewels of the Venetian banks, leaving to the State, i.e. the taxpayer, the task of managing the deteriorated credits, the ransoms, the junk securities: everything that is caused not only by the bad management of the banks, but also and above all by the crisis of the private debt created by the euro system. The independence of the European Central Bank from democratic control of States is the principle that is destroying democracy and the confidence of Italians in politics and its economic system.

Thus, the economic potentates have resumed the dominance and decisions of a people, whether it be the referendum against austerity in Greece, or the choice to use the interbank deposit protection fund to save banks in Italy, are subject to their union, to their blackmail. With this I certainly do not want to say that the responsibilities of the board of directors and senior directors of Banca Popolare di Vicenza SpA and Veneto Banca SpA are not to be taken into account. The rapporteur spoke of irregularities and serious errors in the assessment of credit risks. I have heard deep and motivated accusations in this House that I do not want to repeat. I would like clear and precise rules to identify the responsibilities and force those who incur serious violations of their obligations as a function of liability and compensation actions. In order to manage the components of the assets, which should then be part of a bad bank to be expected at the moment, it would have been possible to rent or sell branches of the Venetian banks to different subjects of the Italian banking system. Thus some of the liabilities could have been requalified. So if we are talking about banking crises and bailouts, which will continue - rest assured - even in the coming years, and whose costs will be imposed on taxpayers and savers, it is worth thinking of abolishing the dogma of the independence of the Central Bank from the Government, that is, the strange principle for which Draghi can tell us what to do, but we cannot tell him anything if he cannot do what he has to do, namely keep inflation at 2%. I know that you do not want to listen to my reasons for the euro system, and then I will remind you how the press, the European institutions, many calls of Italian politicians who want to continue to feed the bad plant of autoracism in Italy, continue to say that all the faults of banking crises are to be charged to collusions between the top of societies and local politics. I would therefore like to ask you why all the social stigma, all the propaganda about corrupt Italians and wrongdoers by the media and by many Members present here affects only the political part. Why does this decree-law contain rules to make it very difficult to obtain a judgment against the crimes, crimes of the boards of directors and of the leaders of the banks? Why must the private sector remain unpunished and always remain suspicious of the administrative and political public? Perhaps because the public sector is blackmailed and must continue to be blackmailed - just like all of us today by the Italian Government with this vote of confidence - by the anti-democratic system of the European Treaties, by the anti-democratic indications of the European Commission? Many will deny this. And we will continue to save a banking system affected by EU regulations, a system that cannot be saved. And all this, of course, will not save Italy; it will not save its people, but it will bring them more and more into slavery.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5030262470245361, 0.49697381258010864]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> RUVOLO (<PARTY>). Mr President, my speech will focus mainly on the agricultural sector. I did not, for personal reasons, have the opportunity to speak in the debate during the first reading. I am also doing this now because I see in this House the Deputy Minister for Agriculture, who may be a little embarrassed to be between the benches of the government and I say why. When agriculture minister Martina announced an extraordinary measure for agriculture, I also had the opportunity to congratulate him. The government had even used the expression \"free field,\" which somehow evoked the earth and gave hope. Again, I complimented myself. Unfortunately, however, there is no free field at all, and there is just one detail about agriculture. In the report that the Government presents to the decree, from which I want to read some lines, it says exactly: Therefore, no longer appears to be procrastinable a decisive intervention of the Government in this sector is - of course it is of the agriculture that is spoken - that could be used as a national flywheel for a new growth of the entire country system. Of all this there is nothing, only announcements. We have been accustomed to announcements, slides, to a whole series of effective communications, but in concreteness, and especially in the world of agriculture, there is nothing. If for a moment colleagues would like to read the original text of the decree, Article 2 has the title: \" Urgent provisions for the wine sector\" - a very important sector. I have heard on a thousand occasions in this House about wine growing, its revival and what it represents. Well, this article, written only and exclusively by bureaucrats and which I invite you to read, says in a nutshell that the requests that are addressed to the various ministries, rather than being made in paper marked - and we are grateful for this - will be made in simple paper. If this is the revival of the wine sector, alas! Not to mention the intervention in support of Made in Italy. There is really something to be horrified if you can write a text like this, without saying anything in substance, but nothing at all: an absolute void. I could then talk about other important issues. We do not understand what it is to do, for example, to have included (I hope that the Deputy Minister may do so) in Article 4 (before the former Article 4) the issue of genetically modified organisms, when this House last July, in one of the first measures unanimously adopted, gave the government then to reorganise the whole matter. The issue of GMOs has been included in this measure in a very strange way. Not to mention the facilities that are given to young people who are active in farming. The article, which I would call ex Article 5, \"Facilities for the youth farming world\", whose management goes to the INPS, says that after the funds and requests are exhausted, all those who are outside that group, those who have applied an hour before or an hour later, regardless of the content of the initiative they propose, with a communication (it is written in this article, please listen to it) are automatically excluded. But I\\'m sorry, in those 20, 50 or 100 questions that are being answered, is there any going outside? Does that mean that the ranking will never flow? Are the few resources that have been made available really abandoned? I make a request to the Government and I ask you, Mr President, to interpret what I am saying. The Decree-Law in question contains urgent provisions for the agricultural sector, but, by chance, it has not arrived at the Agriculture Commission. I think that sometimes form is substance. I know that everything is armored and there is nothing to do, but we ask at least for the possibility of confronting the Government, because there could be and will be opportunities to do so, at least I hope so, such as the draft law No 1328, which has been standing still for a year in the Agriculture Commission, but it could also be an opportunity to really relaunch the agricultural sector. What model of agriculture does this Government imagine? Take pieces from here and there, do this and more? However, I wonder whether he organically has a model to which he refers for the agricultural sector. I don\\'t think so. Gentlemen of the Government, agriculture needs immediate soft credit. The great crisis these days is also affecting agriculture like many other sectors, but it is weaker than the other sectors. There must also be a reduction in costs and, above all, a level playing field for social security contributions on the European average, because farmers pay the highest price index for agricultural insurance. But what competition, what competitiveness can we ensure after what is also happening in the European Union? I am referring to an agreement between the European Union and Morocco that has scourged Mediterranean agriculture; practically, they come from the Morocco area (with Algeria, Egypt and other countries) products that do not have the minimum of consumer health protection. I strongly repeat in this House that so-called plant protection treatments are still done with Class A1 products, i.e. pure poison. I shall conclude, Mr President, by announcing my vote against, but in the knowledge that the Government can take the lead in the commitment that we make, so that there is a real and important opportunity to speak or at least to legislate solely and exclusively for the agricultural sector. It is not possible to do something really horrible from the procedural point of view, dealing in the same measure economic development, environment, agriculture (then there was also public administration). I believe that the government has a duty to give a concrete response to the world of agriculture.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to socialise with you a point that came to me as I listened to the Minister's speech and which leads me to thank my party and my President for holding us to the opposition, because objectively I do not envy some of my colleagues in the current majority today, who will have to come up with a consensus intervention in the face of these communications, since it is really difficult to imagine what they can appeal to. Minister, in the first words of your speech you said that you came today to have the suggestions of all Members - very well - and then you even promised to take part in the work of the Commissions in the coming days, which is historic and extraordinary. I respect and thank our President of the Commission, but we have been waiting for the representatives of AIFA for three months and have not yet come. Yesterday we held the hearing of the Higher Institute of Health, which sent a researcher, Minister. So if you come to the Commission, we'll put on the music and call a band, so I promise you we'll have a party. Minister, what should you have made available to us today, one year after the start of the emergency? Precise information, for example, on the number of daily swabs we will make in the next few days, until the end of the pandemic. Minister, we are still largely under the number of swabs needed; we have new technologies at our disposal, thanks to which we could make 500,000 or 600,000 a day (the ones we would need); we need to know when we will be able to make them, since we are still making 200,000 a day. What are the home care protocols? Minister, one year after the pandemic explosion, I am not yet available to the doctors of general medicine and to the regions ministerial protocols for the treatment and treatment of the various stages of the Covid. If there are - I don't know them, but I admit I can make a mistake - send them to us. I assure you that several regional councillors are also calling for these protocols to be available. When will the vaccines arrive, Minister? He gave absolutely apodictic statements, which I will list later, but not to make controversy. We need to know when the vaccines will come and what they will be. We have learned from you that we are dealing with contagious variants even to the extent of 40% more than the original virus. The article of a WHO member (I do not remember his name, but which you, Minister, know perfectly well) has appeared today, urging us to proceed with mass vaccination. In fact, we need to speed up the vaccination campaign as much as possible in order to anticipate what is likely to be the replacement of the original virus with the variants. So when will these blessed vaccines arrive and what action does it intend to take to achieve this goal? When will 70-80 percent of the population be vaccinated? We need a timing that, as my colleague Garnero Santanchè mentioned, serves economic activities and the country to understand how, where and when you can - perhaps - start again. It's a time-dependent problem like heart attack: if we don't get there as soon as possible, countless activities will never recover. We therefore need to know when we will be able to vaccinate 70 to 80% of the population, as it serves our productive activities and our economic planning. Finally, Minister, we need to know whether you intend to maintain Arcuri or not. At least you have to tell us that. You have mentioned the Commissioner's structure a couple of times and you cannot tell us that it is not up to you: perhaps it will not depend on you alone and perhaps you will have to cooperate, but tell us if you intend to keep Arcuri in charge of the Commissioner's structure, because we are terrified of it. Minister, allow me to say something else (as always, there is nothing personal). We came to make the count of the dead of others, but it is not that, as they say, miscommon half-gaudio, also because we are in the front row compared to these parameters. He has come to tell us more banality (forgive me, Minister): the light at the end of the tunnel and the need to work in the same direction are topics that can serve as a door to Porta and other broadcasts, but not in a communication to Parliament. Your 40-minute speech could have narrowed to ten without these things. He came to us to make claims that we have to cover the elders. Yeah, that's great, but how? When? We need to cover the exposed. Good, but how? When? You're a minister. He has come here to declare imperatives always categorical for others, such as the need to comply with restrictive measures. Mr Minister, of course we must respect them, but after a year the Italians can no longer do so, so much so that, for an absolutely physiological effect, these restriction measures work less and less and lose their effectiveness. In the end, people organize themselves and work, because somehow you have to get out of this mental loop that also begins to involve the psychophysical balance of our fellow citizens. So just keep saying that we all have to stand on the same side and we all have to respect our duties; the first one to respect your duties is you, Minister. The Italians respect their duties, indeed they respect them! Minister, he continued to spread the usual slogans, empty rhetoric and change: the polemics disorient the citizens; Italy does not resign to the reduction of doses. Oibò, I'd say. Stop. We need to become aware. Minister, you accredit yourself and dowry to the new government the results of your absolutely bankrupt Dicastery. We have the world record of deaths on the sample of 100,000 inhabitants and we are third for the lethality of the Covid-19 in our national territory. We have the worst result of reducing GDP on the European scene. You dowry to the new government the greatest failure in republican history, but not for you; it is clear that you are a collector of a series of responsibilities of the Higher Institute of Health and its Ministry, which continues to lie on the pandemic level. Even today, Urbani continues to lie pandemically. Stop. You have an objective responsibility that requires a different responsibility. Therefore, Minister, we still respect you, but you save us 30 to 40% of this aural argument of which we sincerely want and can easily do without.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5338797569274902, 0.4661202132701874]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> <PARTY>AVONE (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 10 October 1813 this country greeted the birth of a noble and austere man, one of those profiles that have affirmed in the world the face of a Italy rich in talent and passion. Each of us has learned to know Verdi artist ever since, among the school benches, our teachers warmed our hearts inviting us to learn and sing the wonderful air of the \"Va,\" thought. And with memory I also go back to the character profile that our teachers outlined at school, presenting to us this great composer, austere man, even grumpy, not inclined to compliments and hostile to celebrations. A man who preferred silence to words, when he thought that all outwards have something little heard. It is then with great modesty and so much respect for the Verdi man, as well as great composer, that I speak in this Chamber today, because, in any case, we cannot allow this bicentenary of birth to pass unnoticed for an artist who is unanimously recognized as the composer who more than all contributed to the birth and development of the value of national identity, and of love for his homeland. The patriotic works of Verdi, from \"Nabucco\" to \"Ernani\", from \"The Battle of Legnano\" to \"The five days of Milan\" constitute a true soundtrack of the Risorgimento, but my territorial origin and my being part of the Sicilian people cannot fail to remind me of the drama where this patriotism is most evident and that is that magnificent and great work that is \"The Sicilian Vespers\"; so patriotic that it is then censored. In fact, for the first performance in Paris in 1855 the name was changed and changed to that of Guzman\\'s Joan, and with a performance with more in Sicily but in Portugal. The Sicilian Vespers are set in Sicily in 1282, occupied by the invaders of the turn, the Angevins. The main theme of the work is the liberation of Sicily from oppression. I like to recall today the historical data of that day: on March 30, 1282, when on the churchyard of the Church of the Holy Spirit, where the people were gathering to attend the vespers, a Frenchman named Drouet molested a young Sicilian bride; the fact provoked the immediate reaction of her husband and all this while ringing the bells of vespers. In a moment the tumult widens with oil stain for the city of Palermo and for the whole island, to the cry of \"moranu\" the French, the oppressors succumb to the revolt. It is a great example in European history, because it would have led little by little to the dissolution of the empire of Charles I. Amor di Patria, therefore, that makes some Sicilian out-of-dates act, such as Giovanni Da Procida, really existed character, who returns exile in Sicily and to whom Verdi says: \"O Homeland, dear Homeland, alfin I see you!\" A yearning for gratitude pervades me then reminding Verdi, who with these expressions stimulates in us the commitment to cultivate our identity as a people, to oppose the old and new oppressions, to the new invaders: the bad information, the common places, the cultural dismantling, the growing impoverishment, and that new emigration that today makes slaves so many young people, and not only the young, forced to look elsewhere for a horizon of the future. Therefore, it is with these sentiments that I want to remember today the \"Cigno di Busseto\", because through his works he always holds in us the golden wings of freedom, while echoing in our heart, never so much, a call to lift up the forehead so outraged and to pick up the \"primier splendor\" (Translated with Google Translate)', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7067124247550964, 0.29328757524490356]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, we have already stated that we are opposed to Article 2: we have also said so in the Commission and have said so in general debate. Of course, I say this once again to the Minister, certainly not because we are in favour or support absenteeism. That's all I need! Absenteeism is there; it is a worrying fact, which must be fought, we would miss something else. But the point, Minister, once again is the approach, the point of view that you have chosen to start and to declare the renewal of public administration. You can't start with the smart guys. If we want to talk about public administration, if we want to talk about good practice, Minister, we need to talk and invest in honest people. To decide to start, as the first sign of this Government, from the smart ones, means to have a point of view and a perspective, regarding the activity of the three million employees of the public administration, prejudiced negatively. <p> The anthropology proposed here is a negative anthropology. In fact, if I think that all employees of the public administration are almost all a bit dishonest (the so-called smarties, in fact), it is clear that I will produce legislation consistent with this vision. We think, instead, that public administration (made by 3,200,000 people) is composed in the huge majority of honest people. <p> Minister, I'm from the public administration. I am a teacher, but I have also been principal and, therefore, I know the smart guys, but I also know 99 percent of the staff of my institute (a technical institute) made of honest people. And my dean's action was aimed at supporting honest people, making them work well and, of course, fighting smart guys. <p> The proposal of Article 2, basically, says: very well, since this world is made up of smarties, further controls are introduced: video surveillance and fingerprint verification. Mr. Minister, allow me to tell you: you took a bit of a risky ride, trivializing the notations that the Data Protection Supervisor communicated to us. We have audited it, we have the notice from the Guarantor that the principle of proportionality must be guaranteed and that instruments such as these should be used when it is not possible to do otherwise, because the protection of privacy is a constitutional value, a value guaranteed by the European Union and therefore attention to its use must be given due consideration because we are still a rule of law, we are still a state made up of citizens, as you say, where the protection of my privacy and the possibility of being free must be guaranteed. I ask you, Minister, by whom will the databases be managed? Article 1 of the text in our examination is very careful and detailed: the core of concreteness is detailed and even the secondary norm is already written in Article 1. On the other hand, Article 2 does not say so much more, it does not say what will be done, who will do this operation, who will check, where the fingerprints will be deposited, who will manage these databases. I would like to know your thoughts and your views. Finally, Minister, are we cost-effective? I would also like to know something about the investment provided for in Article 2, again to talk about the principle of reality, Minister, because I would like you to remain within this principle which is a value of politics. We are called to measure ourselves on people's lives. I can dream of a world much happier than this but as a legislator I have to say what to do and it must be something sustainable, something realistic. I ask you, Minister: will 35 million be enough to activate this control system? Is it a joke, a form of irony, or will public administrations and local authorities have to spend money and resources on biometric controls? Is that the prospect? I invite you to a reading that I think is very useful, Minister. A Neapolitan economist, Antonio Genovese (who you may already know), proposed a somewhat different perspective in 1750 and said that if we want to do good to this country rather than hit the vicious ones, who must be hit, we should try to invest in the virtuous.

It is a clear and absolutely clear emergency, which has been addressed in recent years - especially in the last two or three years - by means of a series of emergency measures which have not solved the problem at all. In particular, in the previous eight months of the Letta Government, that of the prisons was, not only with regard to justice in general, but also with regard to the action of overall government, the main theme, without taking into account the fact that surely the priorities of the country are others. Unfortunately, the current Commission seems to be moving in the same direction. <p> This is another measure, which we call unsystematic, which is still being brought to Parliament\\'s attention today to try to resolve the issue of prison overcrowding. In recent years we remember all the attempts made, beginning, since 2010, with the proposal of the former Minister of Justice Alfano and the subsequent Decree-Law No 211 of 2011. This was one of the first measures taken and used to address and solve the problem of overcrowding in prisons, but the problem has not yet been solved. On the contrary, today we are leaning towards a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights which obliges our country, under penalty of infringement, to lower the number of people in prison by 28 May. All the solutions adopted have been channelled into perspectives that have not dealt in any systematic or organic way with the problem of the overcrowding of prisons, a problem that has been approached with occasional measures, so-called buffer measures, which have meant that it persists and, indeed, can be described as almost incancene. We are convinced that sooner or later, unfortunately, this Government will be forced to adopt total clemential measures, namely amnesty or indult, in order to be able to face the overcrowding of prisons, and we of the North League are the only ones to continue to reaffirm that this problem is not solved by emergency or emergency measures, but by structural and organic action, as we have always proposed. With regard in particular to the content of the draft law under consideration, we are convinced that there is currently some abuse of the use of the institute of preventive imprisonment and that this provision should lead to solutions and measures such that the institute of preventive imprisonment is not distorted in relation to its function. We all know that preventive imprisonment is an institution that has an exquisitely protective function, a function of protection against social danger. Today, however, this institute has sometimes become an anticipation of the atonement of the sentence, and it would therefore deserve the adoption of some measures, which are also taken in part. But we believe that the premise of this measure will not solve again the problem of the overcrowding of prisons. We know that at present there are many prisoners in prison who are still in prison for the first instance, as well as almost as many who are always serving pre-trial detention following a second degree conviction. This is a delicate subject, which deserves special attention. If it is true that there is certainly an abuse in the use of preventive imprisonment, here we invite everyone to be careful so that this measure does not go in the direction of dismantling or distorting the institution of protective custody. Let us reiterate the same concepts that we have illustrated during the examination of all the other bills that we have called empty prisons. This measure, like all the others that preceded it, also amends institutions of criminal law and criminal procedure or affects them, and in particular the extent of the penalty. Among these, we recall the legislation on the suspension of the sentence, on early release, on house arrest, on house imprisonment, on testing, on decriminalization. What we do not understand is why we must go in the direction of altering our order, destabilizing the general system in order to solve a contingent problem such as the overcrowding of prisons. We cannot continue to produce legislation on matters of urgency or considered to be such. It is clear that these measures represent a frayed vision of the aim to be pursued in order to solve the problem. Overcrowding is a problem that obviously exists, but that must be tackled - as we said before - in an organic and systematic way. The Group of the North Legacy will continue to insist that this Parliament should deal with justice, but not only in terms of prisons, but also with respect to other very large and very important issues. We are currently dealing with this issue as if there were only the problem of prisoners. We are fully aware and absolutely agree that prisoners must serve their sentences in prison with dignity, but we must also remember that no word has ever been raised against the victims of the crimes, that is, against the people who have suffered the crimes; not a word against the offended parties, which are often forgotten and abandoned. We cannot forget that a criminal system and a proper administration of justice must take account not only of one of the parties, i.e. of the prisoners, but also of those whom we believe to be the right part: those who have suffered the crime. We are still talking about prisons: as we have already said, the hypothesis of an indult or an amnesty seems to be emerging, but these clemential measures cannot be the solution to a serious problem such as the overcrowding of prisons, because they would result in the emergence of further and difficult problems that Italy cannot accept at this moment. As a Group of the North League, we make ourselves bearers of the cries that we hear from Italian citizens, from honest and good people, from the victims of crimes and from all those who are forced to accept this type of measures, whose aim is always to ensure benefits for those who have committed a crime. We in the League continue to say no to this kind of goodwill policy: not only to clemential measures, but also to this measure, which I can already anticipate what our vote will be. We cannot forget - and I take this opportunity to remind you - that some 30-32 amnesty or indult measures have been adopted since 1942. These acts, which were never accompanied by genuine reforms of criminal justice, did not produce the results expected. The problems of Italian justice are others, and we would like them to be dealt with by this House, too, in an organic and systematic manner. We invite the Government and the majority to remember that we are in a country where there are 9 million pending trials, of which 5.5 million in civil matters and 3.5 million in criminal matters. We are therefore in a country where, in order to arrive at a judgment of third degree, it takes 3,000 days, if not more, and we are, according to the \"Doing Business\" in 168th place in the world (even behind Third World countries) regarding the functioning and efficiency of the justice system. We have approved a reform of judicial geography that is creating dysfunctions in every corner of the country, dysfunctions that then inevitably fall on the whole functioning of the justice system. But with a discomfort for who, above all? Not only for legal practitioners, but above all for citizens who demand justice and want to get it. In our opinion, these are the reforms that a government should commit to: ordinary and important reforms. So our hope is that the new government, in the figure of the Minister of Justice, will really have the strength to make the reforms that we have indicated.

Since January 1, 2019 the turnover is 100% insured. As for the staff of the regions and municipalities, I mean that specific measures have been taken which will allow new recruitments already in the course of the year and to a greater extent than the number of terminations and, therefore, will be recruited more subject than those that cease from the service. I would like to point out, in particular, Article 33 of the Decree-Law on Growth, which is really important, because it introduces a regulation on recruitment that enhances the amount of revenue and takes into account the number of inhabitants. That's new. More specifically, the number of recruitments will no longer depend solely on the resources available as a result of retirements, but also on other parameters: the number of inhabitants, the size of the additional revenue of the individual Region or the individual municipality and the number of employees in service. The municipalities and regions that will find themselves under the limit of staff expenditure, which will be indicated by two decrees of the Minister for Public Administration, will be able to carry out hirings beyond the turnover. Those who exceed this expenditure limit will have to reduce staff expenditure, but gradually, according to arrangements to be completed by 2025. The procedure for approving the two implementing decrees obviously involves the State-Regions Conference and the State-City Conference and local autonomy. I would point out that the development of both measures is at a very advanced stage and is mainly focusing on the identification of criteria which, while respecting the constitutional constraints and those contained in the primary rule, make a decisive contribution - as I said before - to the size of the resident population (the so-called demographic population). I believe that in this way we will finally have new recruitments that will allow the Regions and the municipalities to have professionalism that, by number, training and competence, can better respond to the needs of the community and the territories that are notoriously not homogeneous. It is obvious that we are taking really important measures at the moment. We are doing this very quickly. This is a real reversal of the way in which public administration is understood.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7069404125213623, 0.2930596172809601]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> MARINO Luigi (<PARTY>). Madam President, Mr Vice-Minister, I have considered whether or not to make this explanation of vote, because a rule is introduced in this decree-law which I consider to be wrong and which can constitute a serious precedent for Italian cooperation. If the legislative process had started in the Senate, that rule would probably have been further reduced, if not even cassata. When the Senate is reduced to say only a \"yes\" or a \"no\" it not only reduces the legislative function, but it makes the democracy mediocre. With the same intellectual honesty I recognize that the establishment of the decree-law, in its various titles and with the important changes and the equally important integrations that took place in the Finance Committee in the Chamber of Deputies - also thanks to the work of Deputy Minister Morando, whom I thank - is convincing and useful for the country. We are not a Group led by an ideology, we are not a Manichaean Group or a Demagogy Group and therefore we do not believe that the crisis has only one responsibility. The crisis that has crossed the country has parents scattered across all sectors of the economy and institutions. Therefore, the banks are not free from criticism at all, but they are still essential intermediaries for us to support economic recovery. We therefore trust that the judiciary, the Bank of Italy and the statutory bodies of the same banks will pursue, in compliance with the law, the dishonest directors and those unable of the credit institutions, some even important, in serious crisis or gone into default. However, we recognize that in the last seven years the Italian banking system first faced a financial crisis, which came from overseas, then a sovereign debt crisis and finally a crisis of the real economy, without downloading the costs to the Italian taxpayers. Public measures to support the financial sector were around 4% of GDP for the European average, 0.1% in Italy and around 8% in Germany (not to mention Ireland and Greece). The many cases of insolvency have resulted in a considerable increase in the amount of credit that has deteriorated, and since Italy needs strong financial intermediaries on the asset side, thus able to give credit, i.e. breath, to companies and families, the intervention of the Government becomes - and has been - important and necessary. As he recalled in his reasoned and convincing reply the Deputy Minister Morando, the decree-law moves in the right direction both when reforming the cooperative credit and when building a market of banking sufferings with the granting of the guarantees of the State to senior tranches of the securitisation is also when it intervenes in tax matters with the tax package. It has been said that the reform of cooperative credit banks breaks down the only truly localistic and participatory presence in the world of bank credit. If that were the case, I would first invite the Senate to vote against the government. Let\\'s reason: the BCCs in Italy are 360 and were born one hundred and thirty years ago. At the beginning of the twentieth century there were 2,600. In 1945, 835; in 1961 there were 731. Then a continuous descent, until you reach 360 and beyond today. The BCCs go through three centuries with three reforms, including this one. They are born to meet the needs of rural populations against usurers. In 1937 they open to the artisan world and in 1993 they open to all categories, with a retail practice, doing retail. Even with the important reforms of 1937 and 1993 it was said that cooperative credit banks, then rural banks, would become something else. Economic democracy and participation would end in them and be swept away by competition. They would have been approved by the other banks. Yet, as the number of BCCs drops, these reforms expand the presence on the territory, so as to cover 2,700 municipalities, and in the last twenty years the members rise exponentially. Thanks to the consistent application of the rules of good cooperation, the capitalization of the BCC has been greater than the rest of the system: more than 20 percent, equal to 20.5 billion of these times. But BCCs, like cooperatives, are not from another world. In a constantly evolving market with increased competition, cooperatives must be able to shape themselves to market logics. The problem is that they do not lose the soul: without selling the soul. In some sectors of traditional cooperative settlement, such as agriculture, consumption and credit, the time of solitary cooperatives, atomic cooperatives, which are not integrated into a cooperative group or consortium or cooperative chain is over. The prolonged economic crisis exposes cooperative credit banks that do retail, and exposes them by a lot. The partners physical persons in the past have come together to make a cooperative, to make a BCC against the usurers. Today, cooperatives must also come together and cooperate between cooperatives, in order to defend the values of economic democracy, of participation from below, of defending the weakest in the economy and, above all, to carry out their mission to the full. And not just us, but also the world of credit in Europe. In Germany, with the union between DZ Bank and WGZ Bank; in France, with the union between Crédit mutual and Crédit agricole; in Spain and Holland itself, which was the reference point with a group already integrated around Rabobank and which is even more integrated today. There are and will be profound changes in cooperative credit worldwide. If the Italian credit cooperatives remained as they are, the decline would begin and some signs would begin, some creaks already feel today. Therefore, the reform that we are voting on today will favour the birth of a banking group with a solid parent company, whose majority capital is in the hands of the BCCs; a group based on the protagonism of the single cooperative credit bank, which remains the owner of the banking licence and where the practice of mutuality and cooperative participation remains intact. In contrast to what is happening in Europe, the gradation of the powers of the parent company has been introduced in relation to the degree of merit of the single BCC. The powers of the parent will be proportionate to the riskiness of the participating banks. That is why this is a great reform. The Federcasse must be acknowledged to have self-formed, to have proposed a project, and to acknowledge that the Government has in fact validated this reform. Therefore, to the concerns that this decree-law takes the path of forced approval of cooperative credit to banking giantism our answer is no: this is a true, authentic, democratic reform. The Senate, therefore, today writes a historical page, a page of strengthening, growth and development of the world of cooperative credit banks, without these banks losing their souls. However, on this page, Madam President, there is a small black spot. A stain that the House has tried to reduce, but that there is, is visible and is a bearer of problems. The introduction of a way out, the so-called way out, responds to the particular need - let\\'s face it - of some neighborhood co-workers; it is likely to affect the strategic design by breaking the system; it introduces a virus into cooperative practice and principles. The way out is not an invention of today. I would like to remind most of the groups who have spoken in this debate and who have criticized the way out, that both in the centre-right and the centre-left governments have attempted this very way out, which is what we are introducing today in this reform. On the other hand, the idea of today\\'s way out is also that of yesterday (on the other hand, chameleons change colors, but not the head). To those who say that the way out responds to the constitutional dictation of Article 41 of the Constitution, to respect, that is, the entrepreneurial activity, I reply, however, that the same observation was not taken into account when they were transformed in a forced way - even with my convinced vote - the popular banks in SpA. The way out will generate genetically modified cooperatives, cooperative GMOs, cooperatives that are stripped of their mission and their history and that the next day they will be looking - always with those same chameleons - for an exit from the blockade of indivisible reserves and the unwillingness of the assets to transform the co-operatives into shareholders. In conclusion, does the stain or project weigh more? It undoubtedly weighs more on the construction of a structural project for the finance of the country and for the banks of cooperative credit.

Madam President, today twenty years have passed since the terrible earthquake that shocked in 1997 the central Apennine axis, between the Marches and Umbria, with Colfiorito epicenter. Twenty seconds are a few, but they are endless when they wake up a city in the night; when you see it shake and collapse the house and when people rush out for fear of losing their lives along with the most precious possessions and affections. Since then, since 26 September, there have been various shocks that have lasted months, of magnitude 6.1 of the Richter scale. It must be said, however, that the reaction of the citizens and volunteers was commendable, as it always has been and is also commendable in the last earthquake that still sees us engaged today. Also commendable are the ability to do and the pragmatism of the mayors. And I want to remember in particular three mayors who took care of the reconstruction in my city: Mayor Castagnari, Mayor Santini and Mayor Sorci. In those days, without Facebook and with much less means, we managed to manage the emergency in a commendable way. Then I want to remember Giancarlo Sagramola, who was responsible for Civil Protection in my city. And I'm talking about my city because it's the one I know best and of which I have the most elements, in which there was only one deceased person, who we mourn today. I am referring to Mrs. Agnes Ciccacci, who died in an absurd way from the bounce of a stone on her head as a result of the collapse of a cornice. That was a fantastic model to take as an example: 70 percent of the displaced persons returned home within three years; 97 percent of the buildings were damaged, but 90 percent of the people evacuated in 1997 returned to their homes. The model was virtuous: consortia were built and repair and projects involved entire villages and countries; a virtuous model that was not taken to experience for the recent earthquake. And if in that reality, after only three months, there were caravans and housing modules, so everyone was indoors; and if, after three years, the reconstruction was completed, for the last earthquake, for which we did not treasure the experience, we still travel on the high seas.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6260217428207397, 0.37397822737693787]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Matteoli (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank all the political forces and members of the Commission for their constructive contribution, the level of debate and the contributions they have made during the examination of the reform of the procurement code. And of course, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Senators Esposito and Pagnoncelli, for their work and for their constant research into the synthesis. A measure which is of particular importance in the historical context in which it has been brought to the attention of the parliamentary classrooms. It is right to thank the many people, the professional associations, the experts in the Commission, who have offered ideas for reflection, proposals and ideas that the Commission has taken into account and I believe will take into account throughout the parliamentary process, even of course in the transition to the House. In fact, despite the fact that the 8th Commission dealt with the reform of the procurement code with a delegated law, and therefore with limited room for manoeuvre, the Commissioners faced up to a high-level debate, in my view, substantially changing the text of the Government. But I would like to point out that this happened not against the Government, but by confronting the Government and in its presence: it was not a struggle between Parliament and Government, but with the Government present the text has been changed. On a strictly political level, the bill of delegation received presents lights and shadows, as always happens. Many shadows have been removed from some of the amendments tabled and adopted, which have certainly made it possible to improve the original text. I now hope that the Commission will enhance the light and clear the shadows through the issuing of delegated decrees which, as is well known, will have to be submitted to the double opinion of the parliamentary committees. This certainly represents for Parliament, while respecting the role of the Government, a central step, at least politically. A passage, I hope, that the Government wants to take the utmost account. On the other hand, I must acknowledge that Mr Nencini has followed all the Commission's work assiduously, not passively, but - as I said before - with a continuous discussion with the rapporteurs and with all the members of the Commission. The debate was also attended by those Members who decided to vote against - as I heard in the same explanations of vote - so the final text also has their contribution. I believe that full compliance with the delegation will be essential, and on this we will make our further substantive assessments at the appropriate time. As for the positive aspects contained in the measure, among them there are certainly limits to the recourse to the general contractor, but, above all, the appointment of the director of the works, which will be chosen by the contracting station by the method of drawing lots among the members of a register held at the Ministry of Infrastructure. It exceeds the previous norm, which had caused serious inconsistencies and bitter controversy, probably also due to the abnormal use recorded on various occasions and circumstances, with sometimes inconsistent behaviors. Among the shadows I would cite, as an example, the so-called public debate, borrowed from French legislation, which must precede the realization of public works and not because I am opposed to listening to the opinion of the citizens or, better, to the need for their prior information on the nature and technical characteristics of a work, but because the process established for the consultation of the populations concerned, in our opinion, will produce an extension beyond measure of the procedures carried out, to the detriment of the timeliness of the realization of the works. Moreover, we cannot forget that Italy has an infrastructure shortage, a deep delay that prevents it from competing effectively with the other developed democracies of Europe. It is known to all that, from the moment a work is thought up, until its realization spends unbearable times. Another shadow in the measure is the criteria that will have to oversee the aggregation of contracting stations. The debate and the debate were there, but the solution seems uncertain. It is true that there are innumerable bodies and bodies in the country that can, from the top up, announce and manage tenders and that there is a need to rationalise, significantly reducing the number of contracting stations; it is also true, however, that there is a risk of acting with the cleaver. From this point of view I must acknowledge the rapporteurs for the work they have done and, above all, to Senator Esposito, who has tried in every way to intervene on this aspect. In the Commission we all agreed on the need to reduce the number of contracting stations, but then, when we came to the comparison, there was a measure which, in my view, is somewhat uncertain from this point of view. It is planned to introduce a special system of qualification of the same contracting stations managed by ANAC, aimed at evaluating the technical and organizational capacity, with the creation at ANAC of a national register of the members of the jury of public contracts and concession contracts, with the identification of a series of mechanisms - see also the draw - to ensure advertising and transparency. From this point of view too, however, there is a risk of damage and, above all, delays. My concern - the one that has marked a bit the whole history of my parliamentary life - is to avoid delays, but it does not seem to me that neither I nor those who thought it like me have had great success from this point of view to date. Finally, it seems to me correct to point out that, with the time allocated to it, the Commission has worked hard, bearing in mind that the matter dealt with is very complex and complicated, but also very delicate for the innumerable aspects it determines. Finally, the role that the delegation assigns to the DAC is of great responsibility: rationalizing the procedures of expenditure through the application of criteria of quality and efficiency and the professionalization of the contracting station is certainly positive, but overall the role that the delegation assigns to the DAC is of great importance. I am sure that, as far as the President has so far been concerned, he can play this role in the best way possible, in the interests of all of us. The good reasons to justify the favorable vote of the Forza Italia Group, with the hope that the Government will make good use of the delegation received, are certainly superior to the shadows, so the Forza Italia Group will vote in favour. I would like to point out that no one - neither the group leaders, nor the members, nor the rapporteurs - has ever thought of creating a text of partisanism: this is a text that does not have a political color, but serves the country, therefore the favorable vote of a Group that has a culture of government can only be this. It is obvious and applies to everyone that, in any case, we will be very careful and will verify in detail the content of the delegated decrees.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5037311911582947, 0.4962688684463501]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> ALBERTI CASELLATI (<PARTY>).

Ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, as Beppe Severgnini reminds us, while the world of work was gradually being turned upside down by increasingly precarious employment contracts and forms of underpaid or unpaid work developed, saying \"Italy is a Republic based on internship,\" politics has retracted allowing our children to know only precariousness and insecurity, with contracts and contracts repeating themselves, when lucky, for years, without an adequate contribution either in terms of salary or in terms of social security. This situation has gone too far in silence and, even when it has been highlighted, the problem has never been in priority. Politics was engaged in other things, in rhetorical and roboating discourses, while the world of work, as we knew it, with rights that we gave for acquisition, became increasingly fragile; it broke, crushed, pulverized in project contracts, coordinated and continuous collaboration contracts, occasional contracts, call contracts. Today we have over forty contractual forms. Who wants to work must move in a scenario in which representation, that of the unions and that of politics, is largely unsatisfactory, limited and in fact, often disinterested, to the real destinies of the people who, despite everything, despite these conditions, work. Even the right to motherhood has been put in perhaps: in these years of crisis, in fact, the work of women has kept only because of the over fifty (because of the increase in the retirement age), while the employment rate of women between the fifteen and the forty-nine years, as the annual report ISTAT 2014 recalls, has dropped, leaving our country nailed to 46.5% (in the case of mothers, one in two works in the North Center, one in three in the South), against 66 percent of Great Britain and 60% of France (which have, respectively, a birth rate of 1,9 and over two children, while Italy is still at its sad 1.4). Chiara Saraceno and Manuela Naldini write in a documented search: \"Those who work on a fixed-term basis are less likely to have children in the future, while among those who have children, those who have a short-term job increase tensions in the family.\" And this is perfectly reflected in the fact that, more than others, it must make us think: the increase of women who do not work two years after childbirth, raised from 18.4% in 2005 to 22.3 percent in 2013 (we have gone back): which means that, today more than yesterday, and almost always due to temporary contracts and precarious work, many women remain unemployed after pregnancy. However, we do not talk about this, we do not talk about it enough, the debate is all too often focused on ideological and a priori confrontation, and the reality, the real urgency, is left out. The reality, fierce in its evidence, tells us that one, indeed by now several generations, those of our children, but for some of us we can also say of the grandchildren, not only do they not have the same rights as their fathers, but they often have no protection. This bill of delegation has the merit of trying to remedy such injustices, also because our country needs, in order to restart and return to growth, its best energies. Paragraph 7 (g) refers to minimum hourly compensation, by establishing that a minimum hourly compensation, applicable to employment relationships, is introduced in sectors not governed by collective agreements, after consultation with the social partners. Already with this aspect we turn to many people until now invisible and forgotten by everyone. Too many people work today without the possibility of engaging in collective agreements and are paid on the basis of private bargaining: we can imagine how free they are. With the new rules, these persons will have a minimum laid down by law, in compliance with the constitutional requirement laid down in Article 36, for which the worker is entitled to remuneration proportionate to the quantity and quality of his work and in any case sufficient to ensure a free and dignified existence for himself and his family. The reduction of contractual forms makes the same with another very clear indication, contained in article 1, paragraph 7, letter b), in which it expresses the will to promote the contract indefinitely as a common form of employment contract, making it more convenient - not denying or prohibiting - than other types of contract in terms of charges. Quite simply: businesses must be cheaper to work stable than to work precariously. They are precise indications of attention to a generation that fails to keep up despite the work, who works under pressure or who does not work at all, and that only with great sacrifice and courage, despite the work, decides to build a life as an adult. A generation to which we finally owe concrete answers. In the same way, the desire to review the forms of social shock absorbers, the new forms of protection for those who lose the job are based on the need to guarantee income protection with a remodulation of the ASPI, with a homogeneization of the discipline relating the duration of the treatments to the past contributory history of the worker; but also leaving not only the worker in the search for work, through tools of support and training and continuous help, involving also different actors such as schools, operators of the third sector and private in this iter. In addition, again in this delegation, there is talk of simplifying recruitment procedures, which today are obscure Byzantineisms, and the creation of standardised procedures for the granting of wage integration funds. Of course, we all know that laws alone do not create jobs. We are in a period of economic crisis that does not seem to have an end and has an impact on employment, but the decontribution to new recruitments, with a reduction in labour costs of 24% of the wage bill for new recruitments made under the permanent contract of increasing protection from the law of stability, is a necessary and indispensable first step. Not to mention that this measure is combined with the reduction of IRAP for new recruitments.

In particular, for having accepted the specific reference, both in the title and in the article, to the \"biodiversity of agricultural interest\" food, which made it possible to clarify the scope of the measure by harmonizing it with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and consequently also to have accepted the clarification that these are genetic resources of agricultural and food interest and not, generically, genetic resources. <p> Therefore, the draft law, in the first place, is in line with the international regulatory instruments of reference (Convention on Biological Diversity of Rio de Janeiro and FAO Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources), both ratified by Italy, as well as the existing national instruments of direction, such as the National Plan on Biodiversity of Agricultural Interest and the National Guidelines for In situ Conservation, on Farm and Ex-Situ of Plant, Animal and microbial Biodiversity of Agricultural Interest, issued by the Minister of Agriculture and Food Policy and Forestry in July 2012. Secondly, the draft law allows the establishment of principles for the establishment of a national system for the protection and enhancement of biodiversity of agricultural and food interest, aimed at the protection of genetic resources of local food and agricultural interest from the risk of extinction and genetic erosion. Therefore, the technical aspects of the definitions are important, because biodiversity of agricultural and food interest is part of a country\\'s wider biodiversity. Therefore, the two aspects contained in the aims combine consistency and conformity of the bill at both international and national level, where the existence of different regional situations requires a system for the benefit of the entire country. Furthermore, the particular attention given by the draft law to the protection of genetic resources of food and agricultural interest from the risk of extinction and genetic erosion allows for the protection and enhancement of local situations which, too often, are neglected and, sometimes, threatened by the large markets, while we know that our guardian farmers, in rural territory, play an important role in promoting agriculture and food. I stress the importance of including in the Committee also the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Health, of having identified on 20 May the Biodiversity Day of agricultural and food interest, distinguished in this way from the World Biodiversity Day of 22 May, chosen by the UN in the context of CBD. Finally, I would like to thank you for increasing the Fund for the protection of biodiversity of agricultural and food interest as advocated by the Health and Health Commission. In conclusion, we have tried to facilitate the understanding of technical aspects that could risk affecting the declared purposes and the importance of having a national legislation that puts Italy in place on the subject, through the establishment of technical tools such as the National Registry, the Portal and the revision of the national committee, which take into account the national guidelines provided in implementation of the international commitments signed by our country and allow to approach - as is right - the local and international context. and this happens precisely in the year in which, through Expo, Italian agriculture has been able to present itself to the world as a sector rich in peculiarities and biodiversity and, above all, attentive to environmental sustainability, as - for example - in the case of the protection of genetic resources of local food and agricultural interest from the risk of extinction and genetic erosion, introduced by that law.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the representative of the Government, at the root of the so-called exchange vote, there is clearly an act of corruption. Moreover, we find this case already codified as a crime in Roman law, according to Cicero: the ambitus was the crime of corruption in the electoral scene, which struck behaviors comparable to the current exchange vote and clearly linked to the ambition of the candidate who did everything to get elected. Precisely on this theme, Cicero promoted a law, the lex Tullia, which precisely established the correct way of carrying out electoral campaigns. This is to say how it was practiced even in antiquity a misconception that today, especially in our country, where the greater the presence of organized crime (but not only), has taken the form of a phenomenon that, by quality and quantity, has reached intolerable proportions. So much so that the candidates for the 2013 general elections had been asked by \"Restarting the future\" - a campaign, as has already been said by others, urged by civil society, many organisations and associations and individual citizens - the commitment to strengthen the regulatory provisions in force, in order to counter the electoral exchange between politicians and mobsters. A commitment that many of us have signed and that, once elected, has been maintained - also of this must be given recognition to politics - through the presentation of several draft laws on the subject, including one of the Group For the Autonomies-PSI-MAIE. We have therefore immediately demonstrated our will not only to change an incomplete and inadequate rule of the penal code, but also to put in place a tool aimed at eradicating a phenomenon that unfortunately has become a real system for obtaining votes in support of its candidacy; a system that finds fertile ground in situations of environmental distress, unemployment, poverty, social and cultural delay, of general disinterest in politics (but not only, because today there are other forms). Of course, I leave out all the ethical considerations, which are not up to us legislators or, in any case, the role of politics and parties in the broad sense, because clearly on this point, in my opinion, there must be an act of responsibility on the part of the political forces in selecting the political staff who are running. In order to counter the political-mafia links, Article 416-b of the Criminal Code provides for the application of the sentence to those who obtain the promise of votes in exchange for the payment of money, that is to say that the crime is only realized in the presence of a mafia pact that provides for the exchange of money in exchange for votes, denying at the root the punishableness of a simple electoral agreement not having such an exchange and therefore without any concrete execution. However, the reality is more complex and the offer of money is not the only way - as we have seen and as we have said in the general debate - that politicians or those in his favour act in the corruptive exchange. Favors, promises of information or jobs, protection from repressive action (obstaculating the work of the police in various ways), information on tenders or competitions are just a few examples of electoral exchange, which, however, does not consist of exchange of money, do not fall into the particular crime envisaged today that we are actually going to change. Well, our Group very much appreciated the work that took place in the Commission on the text sent by the House and also wanted the debate that took place in this House today. This work, in fact, could be and has actually been improved; in the end we have a better text than the one at the time deposited and transmitted by the House. Indeed, the changes made - as the rapporteur, Mr Buemi, has explained very well - completely rewrite Article 416-b of the penal code, widening the criminal case and thus filling several gaps or, better, the shortcomings of the original article. With the new text they have been made to fall among the causes of penality not only the release, but also the promise of payment of money or other utility; but above all - and it is of great innovative importance - has been introduced in the norm, as a forecast of crime, the widespread practice of acceptance of votes in exchange for the willingness to satisfy the interests or the needs of the association. Moreover, another important innovation, which involves the subjection of the same sentence, scheduled for seven to twelve years, is completed, not only by those who accept the promise, but also by those who promise to obtain votes. In conclusion, I would like to quote a phrase that can be found on the site of \"Restarting the future\": \"To break the corrupt pact between criminal and political organizations is the first indispensable step to be taken to rebuild the social pact.\" We of the Group For the PSI-MAIE Autonomies want to contribute to the reconstruction of this social pact, we want to contribute actively to finally turn the page to our country. We want a country where normality is legality; a country where even the economy no longer suffers from the influence of organized crime, which is an obstacle to the development of healthy economic activities and also discourages foreign investors. We must start from here, giving a strong and precise turning point to our behaviour, and in this, as I said, politics is also responsible.

It provides that a non-EU foreigner, in possession of a regular residence permit issued by another Member State of the European Union, who stops in Italy for more than three months permitted by law, if he does not comply with the order to return to the Member State, is forcibly expelled to the State of origin or origin and not to the State which issued the residence permit, as currently provided for by our law. <p> The forced return of the foreigner to the Member State of the Union which issued the residence permit and not to the third country of origin of the person concerned is only possible in the case of bilateral readmission agreements or agreements already in force before 13 January 2009, i.e. the existence of Directive 2008/115/EC (the so-called Return Directive). <p> The transposition follows an open infringement procedure as Italy would not have complied with the relevant provisions of the Return Directive. We are challenged by the failure to transpose into the single immigration text the rules that allow expulsion to other European countries and not only to the countries of origin of the immigrant. In the absence of bilateral agreements or arrangements, these expulsions to Europe cannot be implemented. <p> That is, Europe requires us to transpose its directives, as if they were a higher entity, but then countries, among themselves, despite the many EU treaties, despite Schengen, must find bilateral agreements or agreements. <p> We wonder what Europe is talking about. <p> We have seen how France has been able, by applying and/or interpreting this rule, in recent months, to reject migrants registered in Italy and who intended to cross the French border at Ventimiglia. <p> France is among the Member States with which Italy has concluded bilateral readmission agreements or agreements, plus Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Hungary. <p> On the contrary, we must keep not only the foreigners we register in Italy, but also those who enter our country with permits issued by European consulates in their lands of origin. <p> Then we ask ourselves why we have to transpose rules that penalise us on expulsions and we have to undergo the \"ready\" of the obligation to keep in our country the applicants for international protection that cannot depart from the country in which they have submitted the application for protection, that is, in this case from Italy. <p> It is a rule that runs counter to the state of affairs and the dispute that Italy should, on the contrary, open up to the European Union. <p> Once again, we are being challenged by a common sense procedure. Once again the shortsighted or over-bureaucratic Europe does not realize what the border territories are and which countries suffer the most imposing part of immigration, consequence of wars and occupations of some countries of North Africa and the Middle East, but also of a big and dirty business on human beings put in place by criminal organizations. Once again Europe imposes constraints on our country, careless of the load that is bringing the migration phenomenon to Italy in terms of economic, social and organizational costs. The most unusual thing, however, is the schizophrenia with which the Renzi Government is operating in the field of immigration. European law became Law No 161 of 30 October 2014 laying down provisions for the fulfilment of the obligations arising from Italy\\'s membership of the European Union, lays down provisions on immigration and, in particular, the transposition of the Return Directive. Article 3, in particular, deals with various provisions on the expulsion of irregular aliens in order to adapt the provisions of the Single Text on immigration to the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 6 December 2012 (so-called Sagor case), which found that certain provisions of the Single Text on immigration were incompatible with Directive 2008/115/EC. Other rules concerning return are considered by the European Agenda for Migration which is also a Community act and is still under consideration by the 1st Senate Commission. Further names are in the draft legislative decree on international protection, which is also being examined by the 1st Commission. We realize that the draft law under consideration has been presented in accordance with the provisions of Law No 234 of 24 December 2012 on the participation of Italy in the training and implementation of EU legislation and policies. This law provides, in fact, for the annual presentation by the Government, together with the bill of European delegation, of a European bill, which contains rules for direct implementation aimed at ensuring the adaptation of national law to European law, with particular regard to cases of incorrect transposition of European legislation. Just as we realize that the provisions aimed at remedying cases of incorrect transposition of EU legislation into national law that have led to pre-infringement and infringement proceedings have been included here, where the Government has recognised the merits of the findings made by the European Commission. But we also realize that, in the letter of formal notice, the European Commission has challenged further objections, with regard to the shortcomings of the effective monitoring system of forced returns, the failure to prepare arrangements for the removal of citizens detained during the prison sentence and subsequent detention of ex-convicts after their release, and material conditions for the detention of immigrants. These are all open questions that require a very powerful organization on the reception (the centres, on which the light of the judiciary has also risen) and on the monitoring, but also on the recognition, on which, without prejudice to the Italian management, Europe must also play its part. What we do not understand is the urgency to transpose this rule and therefore we mainly contest the location and the times. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. Senator Orellana is registered to speak.

Mr President, the debate that has taken place today has a very wide scope and it is not just about the welfare of the animals of traveling circuses and equestrian circuses. It has concerned and concerns - speaking of the so much-declaimed civilization - the welfare of animals in its entirety, which also includes animals bred for the production of food of animal origin. The speech, therefore, is much broader, as is also evident. Even on the basis of my professional knowledge, I can say that it is quite unlikely that in equestrian circuses there is the possibility that animals live in a state of total well-being. The ways of moving, breeding and keeping animals are often and gladly not very good, indeed there is much to improve. However, leaving aside the exotic animals, on which I believe there is no discussion, because they are absolutely out of their world and therefore must not be brought into the equestrian circuses, I would like to remind you that as regards, for example, the equines, born and lived within the circus, it is clear that the problem of the following must be posed. The immediate closure of the equestrian shows inside the circuses would mean that such animals would be sent to the slaughterhouse. <p> This seems to me to be an elementary consideration. Everyone says that it is not so, but just go and see the end that horses do when they no longer run in galloping stations: they are systematically sent to the slaughter. <p> The proposal is therefore twofold: on the one hand, there is the opportunity and need to establish criteria and methods of verification for animal welfare in the circus world. In particular, some animals are kept well, while others are kept very badly, so there must be precise rules and controls. On the other hand, animals currently inside the equestrian circus should be considered. Therefore, the hypothesis of gradual choice, logical and legitimate, of the removal of circus animals is understandable, otherwise the interest of those animals, which would be taken to the slaughterhouse, is not made. We need a minimum of improvement in conditions and some attention in the provision of funding, while respecting the welfare of the animal; but, on the other hand, I believe that graduality is the most logical response, in the interests of both animals and workers within the circus.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6514549851417542, 0.34854504466056824]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> Mr Zavoli (<PARTY>). Mr President, I am sorry if I take this short space of time between your introduction and my speech to speak in this tone of voice, which is a bit the result of the stunning speech you have been giving me this morning, and I would like to congratulate you on one verse, which has filled me with many flattery, but which has forced the House, the Senate, Parliament to devote me, thanks to your authority, of the compliments and wishes that have deeply touched my heart. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the senators, after the President\\'s complex and penetrating speech, I will of course stick to the de minimis that accompanies every life, and that I have learned directly from Emilio Colombo in this House too. The death of the last constituent transforms in a kind of message the faithfully belonging, and to the very end, to the true, extraordinary and immersive privilege of my life, as he told me right here, sitting in the first bench near the entrance of the hemicycle. On the day of the last speech given by his scranno to inaugurate, with the election of the summit of the Upper House (so with a speech addressed directly to her), this legislature, we exchanged the first words drawn from a confidence that had never touched such personal topics and tones: he was visibly happy to have received from the Chamber, that day, a unanimous consensus, expressed with a long applause. And I was certain, perhaps we all were a little, that in his heart that was the discharge. Emilio Colombo will remain the eminent figure of a policy he participated in in many positions and with the many responsibilities of his career, to say the same, leaving authoritative appreciation of the competence and dedication spent in the most difficult roles, drawing a prestige also due to the singular duration of what, with a tip of civetteria, he called the life of a kind of leader, to whom politics had put in hand the tools not to disfigure. In the annals, one can well say, of his laborious belonging to that world, he lived a lucid and coherent militia, testified above all in the subtle exercise of foreign policy, thanks to the most natural disposition of his talent. Born in a beautiful region and nevertheless atavically aware of the reality of deprivation and remoteness, in a peasant civilization close between the vineyards and the olive trees, it loved to remember a singular outlet at the sea of the Basilicata in the bottom of a language of invented land, it would be said, from the need for a mental gap (made of that transparency that you, President, has referred several times in your introduction), a movement of the soul that did not betray the solidarity of Rocco Scotellaro, the poet of grapes and laborers, nor Leonardo Sinisgalli, the poet of the...Civility of machines, and Giandomenico Giagni, the third of the Lucan poets, to whom we owe the invention of the \"Teatro dell\\'usignolo\", a memorable medal still on the chest of the public service radiotelevisive. In the almost patrician house of Potenza, where he had the amiability to keep me, he cultivated his life in the midst of that sort of civil oratory grown around him naturally, like a gentleman who, having taken the road to Rome, wanted to dedicate it, so the people felt, to his small homeland. He was 93 years old, as you said, Mr President. He was senator for life. He was Premier, several times Minister, President of the European Parliament. Estimated in the gates, not only on the continent. Held in honor of the Church; friend of the reformists; secularly degasperian. There was something abounding in the idea that clinging to a fellow citizen with those powers, and of that prestige, would justify the credit of the political man most voted, in proportion, of Italy. He wasn\\'t a moralist. With a considerable variation compared to the Andreotian aphorism he loved to say that: \"he who thinks the best defeats the worst\". But when \"Tv7\" transmitted a service on a small town of his land, of only women all dressed in black because the husbands had emigrated - and wanting to live in that mournful way, as if they were many widows, to signal their mild protest - then President Colombo telephoned in Via Teulada to tell us, without so many periphrases, that we lacked the knowledge of the tragic, in that case of suffering and pride. He spoke with a bit of emphasis, which in the South often means not to enlarge one thing, but to explain it, feeling, not rarely, an emotion. The Constitutional Charter was his first faith and his last concern. Driven by a Christian humanism, never, for the truth, exhibited as a guarantee of his political belief, liked, and used, these words: The Constitution interprets that microcosm that is each one of us, around which the network of all other social realities unfolds; in which freedom is not declined as an abstract principle, but as an essential and permanent human condition; it was its last reference to something that applies to everyone and to everyone, but especially to those who fear to see it subjected to some undue trespassing in its integrity. \"It is politics not only to build, even to avoid something,\" he said. It was a proof of his miscelebrated optimism; that of those who believe that it is also up to us, that is to say, the task - the psalmist says, but it is also up to politics - to make all things new. I remember him, at home, with his sister Anna - who was his friend, in some way even his mother - on the occasion of the Basilicata Prize, his proud, but not provincial, civic-literary predilection; and when, because of my work, I returned to question him for \"The Night of the Republic,\" he gave me a speech on the cross, so he said, touched not only on Aldo Moro, but also on Italian democracy. He had lived that terrible experience with a painful and responsible fairness, attentive to the sensibilities generated by a national tragedy that required, he would say: \"atrocious costs in which the \"political ratio\" and the \"human motivation\" do not have, one or the other, a designated priority over the serious question of rights and duties, ultimately of extreme proof: that of choosing in a marasma of reason and soul.\" He was an idealist without illusions and a realist with many hopes. As for Europe, of which he preached and demanded political unity as well. The extreme accents of his feverish invitation not to disturb an unavoidable design, he has spent it here, right here in this House. Once again, after a brief, very painful pause, he replied with his mind turned to a thoughtful, partial reform of the constitutional dictation, not renouncing to express the hope that that necessary and rational updating would not harm, in any way, the spirit of the most admired Charter in the world.In the name of a reason that denied the irreconcilability among civilians, inviolable principles, and the obligation, when necessary, to rule for an instance that understands, interprets and unites the whole country.

Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Under-Secretary of Information. All I can do is welcome the widespread response that is also used, among other things, by Decree-Law No 13 of 2017, which you have illustrated and which provides answers to the needs of immigrants. The increase is always in our territories. Although in fact there is no longer a real significant Balkan route, daily from the Tarvisian area come from the rest of Europe flows that are small, but constant; on average on Gorizia, from yesterday 7 to 14 today; daily, about ten. Surely, therefore, the answer that you gave, the SPRAR offer, the increasing attention paid by the municipalities to the SPRAR, to the widespread reception, is a fundamental aspect, which has also been recalled by the urgent provisions referred to in the aforementioned Decree-Law n. 13. This is a fundamental element and I regret that some municipalities - few in truth - have denied the reception, especially for significant reasons, for the real lack of hospitality environments. As for other aspects, such as the progressive elimination of CARA, it would really be a sign of civilization to have absolutely no more. I also welcome the activity that is taking place in some municipalities of our territory, which are aimed at migrants to produce activities such as gardening or of various kinds in order to be able to enhance their skills. This must also be a commitment for the near future. There may still be some critical aspects, but the picture, which is now emerging, is intended to address this problem by considering it as a real opportunity and not an emerging logic. One phase is over and another one is opening up: for this very reason I want to express my deepest appreciation. In the same way, I hope that, where there is already a reception centre for asylum seekers (CARA), as in the reality of Gradisca, we will try not to give life to return centres, because there is a territorial sensitivity that - in my opinion - must be absolutely respected. The fight against illegal immigration is the other great commitment that we are going to pursue through the legislative text, which we will convert into law. I thank the representative of the Government once again for his comprehensive response, also appreciating what has been done by our Prefecture and the territorial commission, which operates without time limits and in a truly extraordinary way.

On 25 February, the League, in a hearing with the Minister in the Committee on Public and Private Work, Social Security, called for the strengthening of the IT system of the INPS, a request that has fallen into the void. Everyone was aware of what would happen, except for this Government and President Tridicus. <p> Today you will have read the beautiful interview with Guglielmo Loy: a direct accusation to this President who centralized the powers and expelled the peripheral locations.

Tridicus, out of shame, we should resign and ask for it forcefully. <p> Unfortunately, the current one is a majority that is a little faltering on some subjects. I would like to remind you that democracy is not the dictatorship of the majority. This is a democratic Republic, not an oligarchic Republic. And we are really concerned, especially because the appointment of the various task forces is demonstrating the failure of your policy. And we are particularly concerned about the economic task force. I would advise you to read the book \"The Conquerors\" by a Senator of the 5 Star Movement, who talks about business banks, speculations, privatisations.

This is a government that - alas - will become the troika of the army of darkness! <p> I\\'ll name you the Bilderberg group, Club Roma, Trilateral, the ones you\\'re putting in the government. <p> Let me remind you that it is politics, Parliament that manages the economy and not the economy that manages Parliament, because in the economy very often private interests force - I use this term - with citizens\\' rights. We are really concerned because you are further selling the nation to the EU and to the great finance; already with Prodi, with Ciampi and privatizations we have seen that the oligarchies want to rule over the people, because for those gentlemen the workers are barcodes and now they will come as falcons hoping for the failure of many companies, which will happen with the decrease of GDP of 9%, to buy them at low prices. <p> Maybe all workers who lose their jobs can be summed up with downward contracts. The League, however, will defend the Italian worker, because the Italian people are made of workers and not slaves of the great finance that you are protecting and you have called to play your role. Vittorio Colao will be the new president of this shadow government: a shame never seen! You abdicated to your task and, therefore, at this point abdicate totally and resign all. Let\\'s leave it to everyone who comes from the banks. We make a big bank called the Italian Government and we make loans to everyone. <p> Then find peace on the MES: MES yes, MES no; Boccia declares that the committees on the health service are confusing; Minister De Micheli says that there is no confusion; we have not yet understood what the mandate of this Economic Committee is, if it will have the task of managing the policy. <p> Unfortunately, my lords, the matter will really get out of hand, because you have a mental and ideological confusion that will not bring any results to the Italian people. Unfortunately, I did not speak today during the information of Minister Bellanova, but I would like to say that, if it is important for this Government to stabilize 600,000 immigrants by forgetting the Italian unemployed, there is a problem: can we not let the Italian unemployed work in the agricultural world instead of giving them the income of citizenship? No, we always have to think about others. I remind you, colleagues and also friends, that we are senators of the Italian Republic and not of other States: so we must protect the rights of Italians, Italian workers and you are forgetting it. <p> I would also like to take a ride on Alitalia. We are pleased that we are working on nationalization, but it is not clear what the perimeter of the airline will be: it must be clarified whether there will be redundancies and redundancies, because we will not allow any dismissal.

It is also necessary to decide on which side of the barricade to stand on, whether from one or the other; sometimes it is also necessary to be the barricade and the League is the barricade of honest Italian citizens. <p> The League is this: a barricade against speculation, against great finance and above all in defense of labor, so much so that in 11a The Commission has always asked - and I do not know what purpose this request has made - to set up the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry into the Health and Safety of Workers; this Commission has never started, but at this point it is vital because workers\\' health must be protected. <p> Also at the sitting of the 11th Commission on 25 February we asked for personal protective equipment and we knew that there was a confrontation with the social partners a month later: do you know how many people got infected in a month in the workplace? I can bring you testimonies of a category that many forget, that of cleaning workers, those who disinfect the places where others work. It is a very important category, but abandoned to itself. Nobody has the devices: there are workers from companies at Fiumicino airport who work without personal protective equipment. Giuseppe Conte, where are you?

They are the ones who have speculated and who look forward to eating the corpse Italy. But as long as there is the League, the friends of Brothers of Italy and of Forza Italia, Italy will not die, but will rise; we will defend this nation. <p> The first great executioner in Italy is Romano Prodi. I repeat: it is Romani Prodi, who sold the IRI and all the great assets. Golden power will not be enough to defend our listed companies. It will be necessary to review and understand above all why the Led Governments and Renzi have privatised the last national assets, have obeyed the \"letter\" and have removed the rights of citizens provided for in the famous article 18.

Gentlemen, today is no longer the time of the Rolex; Today is the time to talk about the third sector. <p> The third sector is abandoned: in all the decree-law there is only one article that speaks of the third sector. We give you some notes. Maybe it is time to protect the men and women in the third sector. The time has come to accelerate the liquidity of 5 per thousand, perhaps even unlocking the 2018-2019 funds for projects at national level. But I understand that talking about banks is perhaps much easier and much more simplified than talking about the third sector, about men and women who are really demonstrating what Italy is. <p> I mention a few names of citizens: Danilo Guaiana, a trade unionist who thinks about helping his colleagues; Orietta Mariotti of Pro Rett, who has a child affected by this goddamn syndrome, but her concern for example was to bring Easter eggs to the other girls.

Last year we experienced one of the most terrible periods of recent years and unfortunately this beginning of 2021 does not seem so different from the previous one. And to think that in this period Italians have demonstrated a great strength. We saw it in the first phase of the contagion: a lot of patience, respect and capacity for sacrifice. Our fellow citizens have stopped, patiently waiting for a return to normal soon. In the second wave of contagion, what appeared to be a doubt in the first wave became a dramatic certainty, namely that there was no strategy to deal with the crisis. Nor was the opportunity to soften the contagion in the summer to build a strategy was collected. <p> Let us remember the letters of the Presidents of the Region, who emphasized, already in May, how there was a problem with public transport and school. We arrived in September with a continuous rain of DPCM and conflicts with the Regions and with a series of decree-laws superimposed on each other. These decrees were then inaugurated, called \"restors\" almost in a consolatory way, but in the eyes of the Italians absolutely derisory. What, in fact, can be the refreshments for activities that are not only denied the possibility of working, but that will not even be able to reopen? What challenges for a real economy that is launched today without support for an uncertain future and without prospects? The uncertain future without prospects, ladies and gentlemen, is due to the fact that this policy of government is uncertain and without prospects. <p> We take note of the fact that there is no vision of the country. Companies and citizens do not only ask to be supported by livelihood mechanisms, they ask to be able to see beyond, to design, to predict, to build and also to believe. What are the objectives of this Government, which will probably be confirmed today, if not to survive itself? <p> What are the qualifying actions? We must resign ourselves to the fact that perhaps the only real action fully shared by the Government was to put Salvini to trial; that was the only reason that kept you standing. <p> And the long-awaited reforms have only become propaganda leaflets without content. True reforms, institutional and constitutional ones, have perhaps only been announced. But seeing the working method, also that of these days, and the weakness of politics (we must note that there is a weakness of politics), perhaps it is better than not even the facades. What happened in the end? Perhaps the cut of Members has only been made effective, which unfortunately today becomes a strong motivation, for many of my colleagues, to stay here. But the weakness and inadequacy of the policy will also have devastating effects, because in the conditions in which it is found it will have to deal with sensitive, important and impacting issues, such as the issue of recovery fund. Let us reason, it is money that seems impressive, but to achieve these objectives we need planning, balance and efficiency. And remember that these funds are not a government resource, they are not funds for election campaigns, but they are also a burden and a burden that our country will face in the future. Politics is not a bar sport discourse: we need ability, vision and vision; colleagues, we do not govern by improvising. This year of enormous difficulty has brought to light a great truth: who is great has turned out to be great and who is small has turned out to be small. <p> Today it is clear to our fellow citizens that there are still no conditions to deal with the health crisis, the economic crisis and the social crisis. The citizens want in politics today skills, projects and strategies, and the show that has been held these days on the stage of Palazzo Chigi is perhaps not worthy of the Italians. There\\'s a government crisis. Don\\'t think you\\'re gonna put it through. It exists because there is no political majority, the true majority. <p> While it is true that votes are individual, government action must be based on projects, which cannot be made through pacts with individuals. The methods used today have seen the most reproached and derided practices that some time ago the most revolutionary colleagues had pointed out as the great evil of politics. I regret to say this, but in the eyes of the citizens there is no clarity in these maneuvers and methods. It has always been said that we need not only respect for the law, but also the appearance of respect for the law, and today, unfortunately, in the eyes of the citizens, the appearance is confused. But what state will we have, what nation will we have if we use these methods? What is the dignity of the State and the dignity of politics? Today we are perhaps going through one of the biggest crises in the system of institutions. Our country has stood up to terrorism, to the years of lead, has held and fought the Mafia, and it is the values - the true ones - of the nation that have won. <p> Today we have a constitutional and institutional crisis that is not just a government crisis: it is the whole system that has seen cracks in the walls that the first earthquake has caused to falter. We have confused citizens, unheard of representatives, politics in search of itself. This crisis in the Republic can only be overcome by the dignity, strength of ideas and coherence of projects.

My dissent begins with the title, feeds on the text and becomes total on the very idea of touching the Constitution. Out of respect for my party, I will not vote against it, but, in accordance with Rule 67, I cannot vote in favour. On the other hand, there is already too much unanimity: commonplaces are spreading that seem true only because repeated with sycumera from the beginning, thirty years ago. The world has changed, but the agenda has always remained the same. The initial enthusiasm of the bicamerals has turned into a real obsession to modify the institutions, a single Italian disease, which finds no comparison in any other Western country. It is difficult to believe that our Constitutional Charter is so much worse than the others that it deserves this therapeutic outrage. Evil is more likely to depend on the unlikely constituents. We are called upon to declare that the revision of the Constitution is today a supreme national requirement. I wonder why, for what and in whose name. The question as to why it concerns the decision. Institutional engineering is used to force politicians to do what they do not succeed spontaneously, but this cadonism applied to the order has always failed: bipolarism had to eliminate corruption; federalism had to promote local development; the majority had to guarantee stability. To put it with Don Abbondio, who does not have the political will, cannot give it up with institutional artifacts. Yet this illusion is hard to die. He supported political strategies, he animated talk shows, he even created the new professional order of institutional engineers, made up of parliamentarians who are experts on the subject - which is, however, my personal esteem - lawyers, who have made it an academic career, and editorialists, who have made it a media fortune. The order of engineers poses only technical questions, but the highlight of the thirty-year period is the crisis of the parties. The political cause of ungovernability has been transferred to the institutions. If you do not decide, it is not my fault, but the state that does not work: this is the motto of the politician, at all levels. However, the diversion was not harmless: it served as an alibi for politics not to face its problems, which have become very serious. The institutions have been altered for partisan purposes, instead of being treated in their essence. The promise was to reform the state to improve the parties, but they both got worse; they had never come so low in the esteem of the citizens. It is time to do our part soberly, leaving the institutions alone. The only reform really necessary is to change our parties to make them fit for the country\\'s government task. The question of what has been reduced to a mantra: the world changes and it has to be decided quickly. But in this House we know that the worst laws are the fastest: the \"porcellum\" was approved in a few weeks; the ad personam laws of great career; several decrees of Monti, approved with the sound of trumpets, are today dismantled by the Letta Government. Ideas-free decision-making has produced a flood of legislation that stifles the economy and everyday life of citizens. We take it with bureaucracy as if it were a cynical and cheating destiny, but instead it depends on the too many laws that we approve here. Luigi Einaudi was right to praise parliamentary slowness as an antidote to regulatory hypertrophy. It is not the speed but the quality that is lacking in the legislative process. The cause is in the overpower of governments that for many years propose only omnibus laws, with hundreds of disorganic, improvised paragraphs, often modified before being applied. This legislative plague destroys the administration of the State, creates disputes, imaginative interpretations and implementing paralysis. Parliament should be given full legislative sovereignty, but we, ladies and gentlemen, should make this self-form without delegation to the professional order of institutional engineers, we should implement it with the pride of parliamentarians: few laws a year, in the form of unitary codes, delegated functions to the government and increasing the powers of control. To establish that it is not legal without first assessing the results of previous laws. Giving parliamentary committees powers of inquiry: a Finmeccanica executive must fear an audition like an American manager when he goes to the Senate. To the third question (in whose name?) is answered: in the national interest. However, every time we have amended the Constitution we have had to regret it: Title V has created permanent conflicts between the State and the Regions; after the ius sanguinis of the vote abroad today we move to invoke the ius soli for the children of immigrants; first we block the balance of the budget and then we exult for the derogation granted by Europe. On the other hand, just read the text to notice the difference. The beautiful Italian language, with the simple and intense words of the constituent Fathers, is suddenly interrupted by a neurotic and technical vocabulary, marked by referrals in paragraphs, as a regulation of condominium. These are the parts added by us. Fortunately, citizens have avoided the worst problems by rejecting the constitutional law devised by the authors of the \"porcellum.\" The only bulwark came from the guarantee presidents such as Scalfaro, Ciampi and Napolitano. I am puzzled by the lightness with which it is thought possible to demolish this last bastion. In Italy personalization has always presented itself as a pathology and not as a responsibility of leadership. Let us not joke with fire: presidentialism would not be an amendment, but another Constitution. We should have a sense of the limit. Our parties today barely represent half the electoral corps, the other half manifested in every way discomfort and mistrust. We are therefore unable, at this moment, to represent national unity. It is not wise to use the constitutional revision to sanctify a government without an electoral mandate. This is the vulnus that marks the amendment of Article 138 of the Constitution. The process links the lot of the government to the times and ways of constitutional revision. Putting a bond of majority as a beginning and as an end in the reform is an unprecedented political-constitutional force in Italy and Europe. Governments pass, Constitutions remain, let\\'s not forget. We should note that our generation is not able to make these reforms, that it can do so today at the very least historical of the electoral consensus is a boldness without responsibility, it is a disproportionately opposed to the constitutional spirit. We leave it to the successive generations to re-elaborate the inheritance received from the constituent Fathers. Not all generations have the authority to change the Constitution. We should take note of this with humility, with the humility of which Pope Francis speaks, which should always accompany the exercise of power. Our humility is the best contribution we can make today to the Constitutional Charter.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5371544361114502, 0.4628455638885498]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> CALIGIURI (<PARTY>). Mr President, for the second time this week, the agricultural sector and the way in which it can develop more and more and become more competitive within the global market, will return to my great pleasure. What is organic? It is primarily a production method according to a model of rural development and environmental and health protection. The organic method is becoming increasingly central in the light of the new common agricultural policy, which places environmental protection and its sustainability at the heart of the process. It was recalled by my colleagues that in 2019 Italy was confirmed as the first European country for the number of farms engaged in organic farming, with over 80,000 operators involved, with two million hectares of cultivated area representing 16 percent of the utilized agricultural area. The net income of organic companies compared to conventional ones increases by 15%, with 31 percent more workers. The foresight of our farmers has been rewarded by record consumption, with revenues of three billion and this without taking into account the Horeca sector. The bio costs more to consumers because - it is clear - it costs more to the agricultural producer, moreover the regulation of the bio - let's remember - has very strict stakes within which all the other methodologies and productions, for example that of biodynamics, will have to move. However, a greater effort is needed, in fact it is also necessary to point out the increase in imports of organic products from non-EU countries, amounting to more than 13%. We should therefore try to reduce our dependence and support the production of certified Italian raw material, guaranteeing the consumer the quality of the product and thus aiming at achieving a fundamental objective of the farm-to-fork strategy: 25% of the organically cultivated area. The question of raw materials today in particular is the key point of the speech, affecting every economic-productive and consumer sector. We witness an immense increase in the cost of raw materials, transport, container, which ends up affecting the increase in general costs, creating serious difficulties. Work must therefore be done to reduce the impact of this on the system. In order to do so, for example, we must also allocate the necessary resources to our farmers, through the organic production development fund referred to in Article 9 of the draft law that we are discussing. With regard to public support and the agricultural sector this is now more vital than ever, given the period of extreme criticality that the same lives. Already before the Covid, which saw the reduction of labour, putting crops at risk, the sector had to face a series of events: natural disasters, the spread of bacterial pathogens, also the result of climate change, such as the annoying xylella, just to name one, which have caused considerable damage. All this has forced the operators, who have never interrupted their activity, also to contract new loans in order to guarantee the continuation of the productions. We therefore call on the Government, in addition to those already carried out - and I do so through our Undersecretary Battistoni, whom I thank for the commitment and sensitivity towards the sector shown constantly - in order to ensure, for example, real help to entrepreneurs for access to credit, for example by refinanceing the agricultural bill that has confirmed itself as a valid liquidity instrument for companies in the sector, especially in the face of the period of emergency lived. I also suggest that the procedures which, due to their complexity, discourage many people should be simplified, as an aid for access to the guarantees needed to obtain funding. Within the draft law n. 988 we find references and references that are the perfect synthesis of what is needed to the agricultural sector in general: strengthening chain, unique organic brand, promoting network contracts, biological districts, monitoring of the sector, traceability. I believe that the importance of each of these arguments is quite clear. In the Chamber of Deputies, the Forza Italia Group voted against the draft law, not because it is contrary to the biological method which, as I said earlier, is fundamental to the development of the supply chain, but because the measure was incomplete. There was no fundamental and indispensable part for Forza Italia, the issue of controls, which was not addressed in any way and, in doing so, would have done a damage to the biological. Allow me to thank the rapporteur, Senator Taricco, and all the Members of the 9th Commission for their work in absolute harmony and respect, because it is precisely on the controls that an important role has been played in the Commission by the introduction of Article 19, which delegates to the Government the revision, harmonisation and rationalization of the rules on controls. In conclusion, investing in organic farming is a win-win approach, winning agricultural activities and economic activities, but we also win, seeing the adoption of best practices, less impacting from an environmental point of view, for a greater safeguard of natural resources. For our part, however, let us commit ourselves to protecting the sector, not forgetting that the farmer is also the guardian of the land, which produces healthy and quality products, which the whole world envies us. Let's do it by monitoring the work of companies to protect those who respect the rules, financing their activities. In the light of the introduction of the legislation on controls, as well as the improvement of the text, I announce the vote in favour of Forza Italia.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5404466986656189, 0.45955324172973633]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> BRUNI (<PARTY>). Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the decree-law before us shows once again that knowledge is an indispensable prerequisite for dealing with environmental issues and disputes. In fact, a large part of the rules introduced focuses on the knowledge of the state of the territories and the state of health of the population. In this respect, it seems to me that Article 1 provides that the land of the Campania Region for agriculture is to be mapped so that it can know how many of them are actually likely to be used for agri-food production and which are intended for other crops. This objective, once achieved, will finally enable us to have a framework of knowledge to be offered to all the administrations concerned and thus to direct their choices in the light of certain scientific data. If you think about it, up to now the various points, the different mappings that have been discussed in today's debate in this House have been episodic, fragmentary and certainly disorganic. Very often, the only reference data used by local authorities have been those found in the various criminal investigations in Campania over the last decades, and this has not allowed the best protection of the population and the same companies engaged in agri-food production; Indeed, the very fact that a great deal of data has been detected in criminal files has created the conditions for the emergence of a growing and widespread alarmism. This has resulted in a strong division on the choices made or planned by the government and local authorities concerned, to which public opinion has not always given its assent. It is precisely in order to reverse and remedy this uncertainty that the land mapping activity provided for by the measure being voted on is therefore necessary. At the end of this activity we will be able to have greater certainty on the land that can be used and on those that must be reclaimed. For the same reasons, one cannot fail to agree on the need for more comprehensive and up-to-date epidemiological studies. This requirement is also part of the need for knowledge that is the guiding thread of the decree. The measure, in fact, establishes the publication of the data of the SENTIERI project, for example in the case of Taranto, also providing for a further implementation of the same. The ratio of this rule is certainly acceptable: it is in the direction of realising the principle of constitutionally guaranteed protection of the right to health. It is less acceptable, however, that the legislator fixed in the SENTIERI project the method and the means to have an epidemiological study relating to the troubled territories of Taranto and its hinterland. In fact, much of the scientific world believes that in order to identify the causal link between the installation or the pollutant factor and the consequences on the health of the population, a method of classical epidemiology such as that applied in the SENTIERI project cannot be used. The further use of this method will still force local authorities to make use of the only precautionary principle in order to best protect the health of citizens. On the other hand, it would be more appropriate to use more modern models, such as molecular epidemiology, with the use of biomarkers of exposure that allow to ascertain, where existing, the etiological link between pollution and damage to health with greater scientific certainty. In any case, it is certainly positive that the decree shows the need for the strengthening of epidemiological studies, since this increases that knowledge framework that allows all decision-makers (i.e. the different administrations) to be able to make the most appropriate choices, avoiding measures to stain leopard or carried out downstream of criminal seizures. Certainly useful can also be the idea of screening the affected populations of Campania and the municipalities of Taranto and Statte. With intellectual honesty, however, it is necessary to specify and mean that with that activity of health control a secondary prevention is carried out on the population (which always remains a success of the primary prevention), often used to gather people, which instead needs real works of reclamation, prevention and environmental protection. Although the critical findings have just been made, the above-mentioned standards make a positive contribution to the solution of the environmental emergencies to which they are dedicated. Among them, it is also envisaged that the crime of illicit burning of waste, which so far does not exist in our criminal system, should be explicitly introduced into the environmental code. It is good to recall, however, as has been done on an agenda proposed by the colleagues of the League, the problem of those who burn, by agricultural tradition, twigs and pruning waste: this case cannot be subject to criminal sanctions, such as the penalty from two to five years provided for in the case of the fires of the Earth or of others of the same impact. There it is good that the Government, as has been said this morning, should make a commitment in this regard. In addition to the burning of waste, there are other important novelties in the decree-law. Returning to the specific question of Ilva, it is the case to emphasize that the decree - yet another produced by the Government on the question - aims to perfect the compatibility between the decree of approval of the industrial plan and the integrated environmental authorization. This express forecast has the merit of bringing together the strictly industrial need with that of an environmental nature. This is precisely the problem of the problems that characterized the event suffered by the ionic city and its population. The decree, moreover, in the light of the experience of the past few months, allows the commissioner the possibility to request new and greater sums to the owner of the company commissioner or to find them with increase of capital, in the case of companies. This forecast is also relevant. However, I must share the same concerns expressed in the debate in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr Chiarelli, who pointed out that if much of the resources available for Ilva must derive from the kidnappings carried out against the owners, then it should be pointed out that the first measure issued by the judges of Taranto has already been frustrated by the Supreme Court and that the seizure order issued by the Milan court is far from being able to assure certain resources to the management of the commissioner. Another part of the decree that must be observed positively is that concerning the administrations commissioners for the hydrogeological failure. Particularly worthy of attention is the rule that allows the appointment as extraordinary Commissioners of Presidents or Councillors of the regions concerned. If this happens, the elbow races will end for the appointment of unlikely experts, often placed by the same policy to give a few more chairs. Significant, Minister, the last story of the Commissioner for Puglia. It is legitimate to ask whether it is not better to involve the local administrators, who know fully the problems of their territory, and perhaps they cost nothing. The reasons set out above lead us to point out that the decree under consideration, however, has the undisputed merit of addressing in a more homogeneous way than in the past difficult and unsolved questions for decades. It is perhaps a first slender legislative instrument, capable of improvement and implementation. At the heart of this text is certainly the shared idea that the protection of the health of the population must not be a mere statement of the constitutional legislator, but a daily objective for which to spend all our energy and resources. If this happens, as I said at the beginning, in an ever more objective and unique framework of knowledge and certain data, then we will have made the role of all those who are obliged to difficult and sometimes exicial decisions for our territories easier. Moreover, it will produce the virtuous side effect of preventing any environmental issue from being accompanied by various alarmisms, which disturb and threaten to mislead the debate on such complex issues as the one we are examining. These last reasons, President, together with the reasons set out above, lead us as the Forza Italia Group to vote in favour of the conversion into law of this decree-law.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.8410429954528809, 0.15895703434944153]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, the text approved by the Commission consists of two articles and contains provisions on the protection of public or private workers who report or report offences or other illegal conduct which they have become aware of in their employment relationship. <p> The Anglo-Saxon expression whistleblowing - as it is called this practice - indicates an important tool in the fight against corruption that allows us to discover and, therefore, to prosecute offences that are committed within societies. The whistleblower, in fact, is a subject that decides spontaneously to report the violations of which it is aware, that they have passed, present or future. It is easy to see how this phenomenon is becoming increasingly important, especially in discovering fraud that would otherwise be very difficult to detect. Whistleblowing is widely known and regulated in the United States - for example - where, thanks to the collaboration of individuals, the Security and exchange commission (SEC), a government agency that deals with market control, has taken numerous actions against various companies, actions that have led to multimillion-dollar sanctions against the wrongdoers. The United States has long protected those who cooperate in the denunciation of fraudulent or irregular behavior, thus allowing the sanction. Several American laws regulate whistleblowing, providing a whole series of advantages and guarantees in favour of individual whistleblowers; some of these laws are also of great importance in Italy and around the world, due to their transnational character. Not only in America, there are several laws regulating this institution. Its protection is much wider and more detailed, providing a whole range of advantages and guarantees for individual whistleblowers, and it is included in an overall strategy aimed at even stimulating the phenomenon. For example, the American system also provides for robust premium measures in favour of those who report violations and offences. Although whistleblowing is an effective tool in the fight against corruption, our system deals with the phenomenon only indirectly and asystematically, and still does not find a specific regulation in the Italian legal system. The draft law under discussion attempts, therefore, to prepare a first protection for the phenomenon of whistleblowing, without pretending to achieve immediately the results of other legislation, trying to introduce improvements in the present situation. Of course, translating and translating Anglo-Saxon cultural institutions into the Italian situation and order is not always that simple. Nor is it easy to force the financial limits, and I shall also report on the opinions of the Budget Committee which rejected the idea of setting up a special fund. Specifically, Article 1 amends the current rules on public workers referred to in Article 54-a of Legislative Decree No 165 of 2001, while Article 2 deals with private sector workers. The reform, while confirming the principle of protection already in force, according to which the complainant cannot be subjected to measures having negative, direct or indirect effects on working conditions, presents a number of elements of novelty. The scope of the framework is extended to public workers other than employees (collaborators or consultants), workers, collaborators and consultants of public economic bodies, private law entities subject to public control, workers and collaborators of undertakings supplying goods or services and carrying out works in favour of the public administration. The provisions shall apply to alerts made in the interest of the integrity of the public administration. With regard to the possible recipients of the report, the news replaces the reference to the hierarchical superior with that to the responsible for the prevention of corruption: it is present in every public administration pursuant to article 1, paragraph 7, of law n. 190 of 2012. The hypothesis of reporting to the National Anti-Corruption Authority (NAAC) or of reporting to the ordinary judicial authority or accounting officer remains firm. With regard to the principle of protection, it is expected that the adoption of measures deemed to be retortive will be communicated in any case to the DAC, by the interested party or the most representative trade union organizations, and that the latter will inform the Department of the Civil Service or the other guarantee bodies for the determinations of competence. In this regard, it is recalled that the current rule provides, instead, that the interested party or the unions report the measures deemed discriminatory to the Department of Civil Service. In the case of a discriminatory measure, a financial administrative penalty of EUR 10,000 to EUR 50,000 shall be introduced, at the expense of the person responsible for adopting the measure, without prejudice to other liability profiles and taking into account the size of the institution to which the alert relates. It introduces the reversal of the burden of proof on the employer, who will have to demonstrate that discriminatory or retortive measures taken against the reporting agent are motivated by reasons other than the reporting itself, confirming the nullity of discriminatory or retortive acts adopted by the employer against the worker. And, if it is found to be unlawful dismissal, the reinstatement is arranged in the workplace, including by court order, in addition to compensation for any moral, economic or career damage suffered and the reimbursement of legal expenses incurred. The existence of a discriminatory measure is established by DAC, which is also competent to impose the relevant sanction. The protection of confidentiality regarding the identity of the reporting author is also modified, limiting the current derogation from the principle of confidentiality to the case where the knowledge of identity is indispensable for the defence of the accused, provided that the dispute is based, even only partially, on the alert and only in the presence of consent by the data subject. It is confirmed, however, that the rules on the right of access to acts set out in Law No 241 of 1990 do not apply to the reports in question. ANAC is entrusted, after consulting the Data Protection Supervisor, with the preparation of guidelines for the presentation and management of reports that guarantee the confidentiality of the reporting employee. There are sanction mechanisms for cases of both the absence of procedures for the forwarding and management of alerts and the adoption of procedures that do not comply with those laid down in the legislation. On this point, on the basis of the work carried out in the Commission, specific sanctions are introduced if it is established that there is no verification activity of the alerts received by the person responsible, applying to the latter a pecuniary administrative penalty from 10,000 to 50 000 euros. Medesima sanction is previewed in the cases of absence of procedures for the forwarding and the management of the alerts, or in the cases of adoption of procedures not conform to those prepared from the DAC. As it is easily intuitable, the choice to increase sanctions in cases of absence of reporting procedures and in cases of failure to respond to the reports received is due to the desire to prevent omissive conduct that would have direct effects on the functionality and effectiveness of the reporting. The application of the protection is not guaranteed in cases where the criminal liability of the reporter for the offences of slander or defamation, or in any case for offences committed with the same alert, or his civil liability, for the same title, in cases of malice or gross negligence, is established, even by judgment of first instance. Article 2 of the draft law extends to the private sector the protection of the employee or collaborator who signals illicit, through changes to Article 6 of Legislative Decree no. 231 of 2001. In particular, the rules on the administrative liability of private entities arising from offences are complemented. The rules apply to private bodies, companies and associations (including without legal personality) as well as to public economic bodies. Under this legislation, they are liable for offences committed by certain persons in the interest or for the benefit of the institution. The responsibility of the latter shall be excluded if certain conditions are met, including the adoption and implementation of organisational and management models with certain requirements. The novels in Article 6 of Legislative Decree No 231 of 2001 supplement the requirements laid down for these models. In particular, they shall include, at the expense of those who in any capacity direct or cooperate with the institution, the obligation to submit detailed reports of offences or breaches of the model of organisation and management of the institution, of which they have become aware because of the functions carried out. Alternative reporting channels, of which at least one is capable of guaranteeing, even in a computerized manner, the confidentiality of the identity of the reporting agent, as well as appropriate measures to protect the identity of the reporting agent and the related sanctions against those who violate the protection measures of the reporting agent, as well as those who carry out, with intent or gross negligence, reports that prove unfounded. The prohibition of acts of retaliation or discriminatory, direct or indirect, against the reporting agent for reasons related to the reporting. It is further specified that the adoption of discriminatory measures against the persons making the reports can be denounced to the National Labour Inspectorate, for the measures of its own competence, as well as from the reporting agent also by the trade union organization indicated by the same. Finally, also for the public sector, the nullity of dismissals or other back-up or discriminatory measures taken against the reporting agent, including changes in duties, is established, and the employer bears the burden of proof that the organisational measures taken after the reporting are based on reasons unrelated to the reporting. Many things - the debate in the Commission has highlighted this and I imagine that it will do the same in this House - can be corrected, even in the light of practical experience, but this is undoubtedly a step forward.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5715508460998535, 0.4284491539001465]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, the constitutional revision has aged before it is born.

An assembly as large as it is weak, whose members owe everything to the appointment of the head of the party or to the increase of the seats associated with the election of the Premier. On the other hand, the number of Members had to be reduced and selected from one-name colleges, without recourse to the Lords of Preferences and the nominations of Italicum; the House's authority towards the Executive should have been strengthened. American democracy, while leading an empire, has never renounced the balance of power between government and Parliament. Why, then, did he lose so many opportunities? The lack of genuine reform has produced a very long text, a poor legislative bill, an unpleasant bureaucratic jargon. Just read, for example, the additional competences of the Senate defined - I quote - in the laws referred to in Articles 57, sixth paragraph, 80, second period, 114, third paragraph 117, fifth and ninth paragraphs, 119, sixth paragraph, 120, second paragraph, 122, first paragraph, and 132, second paragraph.

Instead, the contingent political need prevails over every institutional guarantee, until the paradox of rewriting the second part of the Charter in an elected Parliament in illegitimate form. <p> In Italy one does not govern to improve the State; one changes the State to strengthen the Government. On the contrary, the Constitutions govern politics because they are long lasting. On this principle, the reforms of the last two decades, which have always been approved against each other, have failed to prop up the governments that had lost the confidence of the voters. So Berlusconi did in 2005 and - alas! - also my share with Title V.

The Italicum and the Boschi law are eager to keep him artificially alive, using the absolute premiered without counterweights: a minority of 20% of those entitled to vote wins the bench and imposes their will on the majority of the country. All this increases abstentionism and reduces consent to bipolar competition. Everywhere the old dialectic between parties is overwhelmed by the new divide between the elite and the people. European countries have become ungovernable due to excessive governance. One simple truth has been forgotten: in order to lead today's fragmented societies we need a wider consensus than yesterday; political classes must learn to convince people rather than reduce representation; majority prizes in the long run cannot surrogate voters who do not vote. The policy has been reduced to mere system administration. This led to the leadership of the Executives over Parliaments. But on the European horizon the great dilemmas of peace and war, of the limits and links between religion and politics, of the reception and rejection of migrants, of individual freedom and public ethics, of the technological power and of the intangibility of life, of economic development and of the duration of the planet return. They are not problems solved by the Commission, they are contemporary conflicts that need new cultural and political recognition and will only be possible in a new parliamentary democracy as we have not yet known it. The one of the past century was able to neutralize the conflicts between the State and the Church, the city and the countryside, capital and labour. Parliaments are still to be imagined capable of reconstructing the fractures of European civilization in the new century. The world before us is very different from that of the nineties.

A discussion about itself, in fact, had both the effect of maiming the scope of the bill, deleting from the debate the title relating to cohabitations, and that of making the theme of adoptions appear as a constituent of the discipline of civil unions, thus inducing the idea that those who oppose or have doubts about Article 5 do not want to recognize the unions themselves. <p> I\\'ll proceed with order. It is thanks to the <PARTY>, to the whole <PARTY>, to have brought this measure to the vote in the Chamber, which, in line with Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, regulates cohabitations, completing the legal framework of what I love to call the right of affection. And going against the current, I stress that the regulation of civil coexistence is no less important, not only for the extension of the phenomenon, than that of civil unions. The discipline of cohabitations, in fact, offers protection not only to the more uxorio cohabitations, but also to the cohabitations of solidarity, which are often the consequence of the abandonment of people by family members and the flight of them from their ethical and legal duties. And more: the discipline of living together recognizes, just the second paragraph of Article 3 of the Constitution, the right of people to choose the degree of legal binding to give to their affective relationships. I do not believe that all this incentive to de-responsibility, but on the contrary I believe that it helps to increase awareness, in addition to protecting the weak part. It is also due to the <PARTY>, the whole <PARTY>, to have brought the discipline of civil unions to the vote in this House; a discipline that offers homosexual couples the opportunity to formalize their bond and to give recognition and legal protection to the same. In this context (and not in other artificially constructed) the subject of adoption of the partner\\'s son is included, as regards civil unions. It is quite clear - I repeat - that discussing this profile does not mean calling into question the recognition of the unions themselves, that adoption, on the contrary, is the inevitable prerequisite. Moreover, it is also clear that to pose the problem of a discipline of adoption which, in line with the provisions of Law No 40, is concerned with making the prohibition of surrogacy more effective, is an initiative which, far from being opposed, raises the problem of making the legal regulation of adoptions more appropriate. Moving on this horizon means not denying the problem of the need for legislation not only and not so much consistent with the legal framework, which provides for the crime of surrogate motherhood, but above all attentive to the balance between the right to be parents and that of being children, both attributable to the inviolable rights of man, which the Republic must recognize and protect, in accordance with Article 2 of the Constitution. This legislation must be declined in the light of the second paragraph of Article 3 of the Constitution, known as the founding norm of our Charter, the result of overcoming the Enlightenment vision (limited to the legal declaration of rights) and which is based on the recognition of the absolute centrality of the human person, each and all, thus placing the question of the limit of the right of each in relation to the law of the other. This makes every absolute vision of a right unconstitutional, which would inevitably be irreconcilable with the fundamental principle of balancing and between rights, which prevents someone, in the name of his right, from prevaricating that of others. It is the city of all for all: that of the indispensable duties of political, economic and social solidarity and the full development of the human personality. In this context, I put my reflection on Article 5, i.e. on stepchild adoption. The horns of the problem can be summarized at the following moment. On the one hand, I rely on the words of those who have argued that: It is necessary to ensure that those who take care of the adopted child have the right motivation and also have the means and the ability to ensure a serene growth. Who is in such a condition? Certainly first of all a family composed of a man and a woman who have wisdom and maturity and who can ensure a series of interfamily relations (...). In the absence of this, it is clear that other people, even single people, could in fact give some essential guarantees. I would not therefore close myself to a single possibility, but I would leave it to those responsible to see what is the best solution in fact, here and now, for this child or child. The aim is to ensure the maximum possible favourable conditions. Therefore, when the choice is given, it is necessary to choose the best of the choices. On the other hand, I refer you to the following reflection: It is an era in which we feel subjected to various threats, the discrimination between the natural and the artificial mixes, there are not only \"magnificent fates and progressives.\" It is a drift for which society does not exist but only individuals exist. How do you say, for example, that having a child is a right? How can one think of declining everything into the key of individual freedom, as if what happens was apart from the way in which the wills and consciences of human groups are composed? These are the reflections of Carlo Maria Martini and Giuseppe Vacca: the reflections of two personalities with deeply different stories and cultures, but moved with evidence by that intellectual honesty that does not prevent a prince of the Church (already in 2008) from recognizing that adoption cannot be precluded even to other people, even to the limit of singles, provided that everything moves with attention to the interest of the child to ensure him the maximum of favorable conditions, and to a Marxist philosopher to say that having a child is not a right and that not everything can be declined in individual freedom and in individual rights atomistically considered. The terms of a truly secular and constitutionally oriented debate are, in my opinion, exactly these. On this basis, as my first signature also shows, I recognise that the partner of the civil union can adopt the child of the other partner, not for his or her right to parenthood (which does not even have the spouse), but if and insofar as this is in the sole interest of the child. And I would add that, in the context of a reform of the adoption law, I am convinced that it must be regulated, taking away from the possible fluctuations in jurisprudence, also the legitimacy of the members of civil unions to the adoption tout court, provided that it is in the child\\'s exclusive interest. As Cardinal Martini warned, in fact, the orphanage or the family home are not, always and in any case, the best solution in the absence of a heterosexual couple of adoptive parents. On the contrary, concrete experience objectively leads to ascertaining the superior quality of personalized and close relationships and the decisiveness of the latter for the growth of children where the natural condition is lacking. I would also add that, without prejudice to all the checks provided for in the Adoption Act, I have tabled several amendments which recognise the adoption by the partner for the children already born. For the future, however, one cannot ignore the effectiveness of the prohibition on surrogacy. Many say so, with different sensibilities, with different stories, having as much attention to the condition of the woman, who rents the uterus, as to the child so conceived. And we know that, unfortunately, the problem is universal, that is straight and homo, with the deviations that come up to the claim to be mother and parents without even the burden of pregnancy, up to the possibility of choosing at the table of the mother and the biological father by the legal parents. Summa lex, summa iniuria. Do we really not want to open ourselves secularly to the evidence of the matter? Do we really want to deny the objectivity of the theme? Do we really not want to open ourselves to doubt and admit that the problem of surrogacy should be addressed in connection with stepchild adoptions (clear, even for heterosexual couples)? Do we really want to insist on believing that a more analytical discipline, which, recognized the adoption of children already born, guarantees, for the future, a greater effectiveness of the prohibition of surrogacy is a cancellation or, worse, of Article 5? We accept the challenge of confrontation, and not of prejudice, and we build the solution in this House: it is already written in many of the reflections that have emerged in this general debate and in so many amendments to this bill.

Mr President, the most earnest desire to avoid polemics is disassembled whenever and on every occasion we become aware of new news. I now learn, at the end of the Conference of the Leaders, from the President of our Opposition Group, that a letter from the Group Presidents of the Forces who support the Government to President Casellati would be sent - and so far nothing objectionable - to the behaviour of the State Accountant when ratifying the Decree-Law on the PNRR.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus the attention of the whole House on a fact that took place a few days ago.

But, above all, some children could not stay with their mom or dad for such a phenomenon.

Some countries concerned - in particular Slovakia - do not seem to want to adhere to the international conventions on this point. We have, among other things, the case of the Association International child abduction Slovakia, which had to intervene with the ambassador of the Slovak Republic Jan Soth, because very often the orders of the Italian and Slovak courts are disregarded in their application. Six cases have been reported to the undersigned, including that of Andrea Cavalcanti, who has won all the practices - both in Italy and Slovakia - but whose son is still held in Slovakia; the case of Leonardo Rassu who, after years of useless battles, tried to bargain with his ex-wife in order to meet his daughter, but very often goes up to Slovakia, and then has to return without being able to meet her; the case of Emiliano Russo, whose impossibility to meet the offspring caused him such a situation of prostration to lead him to contract a serious disability; the case of Alessandro Matera, whose former Slovak companion died suicidal and, despite this, the Slovak court preferred to entrust the minor son to the Slovak brother-in-law instead of to the father; the case of Andreas Masoner, who sees his son on Skype for years now, and the case of Marco Di Marco who, despite an executive measure of repatriation of the court of Ascoli Piceno, despite favorable measures of the regional courts of Bratislava and the Slovak Supreme Court, sees his son on Skype for four and a half years.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to speak about Antonio Maccanico\\'s personality, also because I had the pleasure of personally meeting him here, in this House, in the 11th legislature, and of having him in the work of the bicameral Commission De Mita-Iotti. It was a short legislature, so the meeting was quite fleeting, but it was enough for me to grasp and appreciate the grace of the person and the thickness of the figure. Maccanico had a very special role here, and I want to bring back a precise memory of those days spent with him. In that legislature there were two great personalities of political and legal culture in this House, Norberto Bobbio, Senator for Life, and Gianfranco Miglio, disputable, questionable personalities, contradictory intelligence, but great intelligence, and I remember very strongly, having been lucky to be present, the dialogues on the maximum systems that took place among these great personalities in the pauses of the Assembly\\'s work. The role of Maccanico was that of mediator when they occurred - and I assure you they often occurred - these \"continent clashes\" between Bobbio and Miglio. And it was a great political and cultural pleasure to attend and participate in these dialogues. Maccanico was not a totus politicus; as has been recalled here, he was a man of the institutions, lent to politics always in critical and very peculiar contingency. When the problems become acute and the solutions are lacking, these men are usually used, and Maccanico was one of these reservations of politics and also of Italian political and legal intellectuality. Senator Compagna recalled how Maccanico had no crickets of direct democracy: he loved Parliament and was a man of Parliament, who formed himself within Parliament and practiced his presence in a constant way. It was said: grand commis. I would not use this formula, also because here we have to recognize the practicability of this French model that I see again among the temptations of institutional reform. Our politicians do not have behind a school education such as the École Nationale d\\'Administration (ENA) or like the Parisian Polytechnique. Here our career as a technician and a career as a politician are separated and the personalities that count, by alternation, play the one and the other role at different times. Maccanico did this very well. He worked as a technician close to the Presidency of the Republic and the Presidency of the House. It was remembered how he left his mark on the Additional Note of La Malfa, fundamental in the history of our country. I would also like to mention the 1971 reform of the House\\'s parliamentary regulations, of which Maccanico was a great protagonist. Maccanico then stands as a politician in Parliament and as a politician in the Government, until the famous failed attempt of 1996. And it is symbolic of his disappearance at the very moment when this attempt, in such peculiar and different forms, is to some extent repeated. We said grand commis no, but servant of the state no doubt yes. We should reevaluate this figure of the servant of the State: it is a somewhat obsolete figure, today unknown, with a sympathetically nineteenth-century patina of liberal imprint and of crocian formation, made of sobriety, seriousness, competence, deliberately hidden in the folds of the institutions, which is and never appears. A figure to reevaluate just today, when we are used to having everything and always on the scene and, then, we see and see that behind the scene of many characters, as under the dress, there is nothing. Institutions are a very delicate body; they must be handled and cared for with great care, otherwise they risk ruining themselves. In these twenty years, in the rage of institutional reforms to small pieces, in the rage of savage interventions on electoral laws, this institutional field has been devastated. I would like to recall a script by Maccanico entitled \"Institutional reforms: problems and perspectives\": it is a lecture from 1989-1990 that he did at the study seminars for officials aspiring to parliamentary work, in which he took a bit of the experience of the De Mita Government, judging it as the first government program. One of the key policy points was institutional reforms and the Government-Parliament relationship. And there he said that there was political stability and government instability in Italy. What we have seen afterwards is, instead, a government instability that is accompanied by political instability. And that is also the profound reason for today\\'s crisis. Maccanico recommended, in his lectio, to implant the problem of institutional reforms in a gradual sense, in small steps: this is a lesson that we should keep very much in mind today. We said that institutions should be carefully followed and cared for. Maccanico was at the bottom a maintainer of the state machine, a great maintainer, those who know this machine very well, to perfection: they know how it works, they know where you can find a fault and above all they know where to put your hands when this failure is to be repaired. Here, we would need these figures very much today, precisely because this machine-state is something that needs to be lightened in its construction and structure and therefore reformed, as we are going to do today. The institutions are this through intermediate between citizens and state, between people and government; therefore indispensable, because through them pass and must pass the decision and mediation; they are like a filter to keep clean. Well, Maccanico was the one who kept this filter clean all the time and so he let it through, or at least he had the intention of getting it through there, decision and mediation. But politics goes through there, too. When the institutions lose this function, they lack their prestige and, when their prestige fails, it triggers that detachment that lies at the origin of this no longer bearable - believe me - crisis of the idea itself and of the very practice of politics. We shouldn\\'t put up with it anymore! <p> Maccanico was certainly a member of the elite. But, look, the elites are necessary, just as the masses are necessary. And the relationship between the elite and the masses must be rebuilt for the new times, it must not be reset. That is the point and, at the same time, the task of the reform that must be implemented. How do you select the political class? Not his suppression, but his selection is the problem. How are the management groups, the management classes formed? There is a need for process direction just as much as there is a need for participation in decision-making processes. The high and the low must reunite, they must not contrast. There is to practice a difficult, tiring, but necessary reconstruction path, a mediating plot between us who are here and everything confusedly pushes and pushes out of here. I\\'m gonna finish. The sacred criticism of what has happened in these years of corruption, separation, self-referentiality and even undeserved privileges of the political class must be accompanied by a reconnection of continuity between what happened the day before yesterday and what may be tomorrow. Here, this is the cure, the bridge that we must prepare, because from the solidity of the institutions, despite the failures of politics (the institutions today, fortunately, keep more and better than politics), only from this solidity can the real change come. It must be said that the traumatic interruption, the destruction of the past, is a regressive fact, a conservative fact: it does not change, but preserves and repeats. From there, from these tears, in the plot of history no new solutions have ever come: old returns have always come. I apologise for this fact that may seem annoyingly paternalistic, but it is not and does not want to be; but I take advantage of this opportunity to do so. I would therefore like to say to the new energies that have entered the institutions, also in this branch of Parliament: here, take advantage of the stay here, of this experience, to discover and appreciate figures like the one we are commemorating, because there is everything to learn. Equipment of an institutional culture is essential, it is indispensable for good public action, otherwise - look - you turn like shovels in the wind, depending on how the wind turns: this is what we cannot afford in this anti-political purgatory. One last point, Mr President: I am preparing, as far as I know, for the publishing house \"Il Mulino,\" two precious volumes of previously unpublished diaries by Antonio Maccanico concerning his collaboration with the President of Pertini. When they appear publicly we make sure to present them here, with the excellent officials of the Library of the Senate, taking advantage of that event to resume the speech on Maccanico in a less celebratory way, but entering more in the merit and contents of his person, because we all need it, the country needs it, Italy needs it.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5908675789833069, 0.4091324210166931]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Conte (<PARTY>).

I want to say very clearly to Senator Bonfrisco that respect for commitments with European partners is a choice of seriousness, which allows us and will allow us, without the subalternity that previous governments have had, in particular the Berlusconi Government, to assert the reasons of our country, even more in the near future, in the places where we will have to decide a different future for Europe. <p> This is the seriousness: keeping commitments is the fundamental condition to change the rules, to redesign a future of development for the whole of Europe, to move from accountant and imaginative exercises, in which Minister Tremonti was master, to a plan of solidarity and inclusive development for Europe. A passage all the more necessary today, which we see on the horizon old and new anti-European drives. <p> We believe that the weight of the rebalancing, which, as we know, provides for a two-thirds share from the state budget and for a third from the local authorities, is correct, although we understand that the Italian municipalities are now in trenches to try to maintain the level of services, as well as to give answers to the needs arising from the new poverty, which are becoming increasingly established in our country. <p> This measure incorporates the refinancing of 120 million of the Solidarity Fund and encourages the unions of Municipalities, a measure, albeit small, necessary, to trace a virtuous path. It should also be said that the reduction of EUR 450 million in the Internal Stability Pact 2013 is offset in the Stability Act by enlargement of one billion planned for 2014. However, we want to say that the central theme of local authorities is not only the spending capacity, but also the need to overcome too much legal segmentation. This is an invitation we make to the government for the next few years. <p> The decree still contains other measures, on which I regret that my colleagues in the League have ironized in an unethical and unethical way. <p> For example, those related to the emergency in Lampedusa, where everything we know happened: with this measure is given an immediate response to the civil and social drama that has affected the entire national community and on which no one is allowed to speculate for bi-political reasons. <p> There was the moment of tears and mourning, but there was also the moment of concrete initiatives, which today, approving this decree, become structural with the resources for the reception of unaccompanied foreign minors, with a fund for immigration to be allocated to women immigrants in pregnancy. That's what we're talking about. It is a humanitarian and civil plan on which we are all committed and on which we must continue to engage beyond political controversy. <p> The rules on the payment of public administration's debts to businesses are also of considerable importance. As we know, this is one of the key points that will allow Italy in 2014 to realise in a convincing way the engagement, that we all hope, to the economic recovery. Also thanks to some changes made to the House to the original text, this measure removes some obstacles that prevented the acceleration of the payment of debts of the public administration to the enterprises. <p> In particular - why not remember that? - the timing is defined, so the 2014 resources are already allocated by 31 March 2014, so very quickly, together with the resources not used in 2013 to anticipate liquidity. There is also talk of the thorny issue of off-balance-sheet debt payments. These are important choices, which will help the business world, on which it is necessary, we say to the Government, constant monitoring to verify the timely and timely implementation. <p> As a Group of the Democratic Party we will therefore vote in favour of the conversion into law of this decree-law, convinced that it represents a further step in the difficult path of exit from the crisis with the recovery, in order to quickly restart the recovery. <p> It is a message that is worth even more, Senator Bonfrisco, in these days when in the Italian squares there is a protest that certainly collects forms of social discomfort and malaise, but that tries to channel towards destructive outlets, not of the Government, but of the institutional structures of this country. <p> I believe that the political forces, all of them, apart from the controversy, debate and dialectic that is necessary, should never use the demagogy that you used, Senator Bonfrisco, on these issues. <p> In the law of stability a great effort has been made for drivers. An agreement has been reached with their representations. Let us not smooth the hair of those who want to destroy the institutions. Let us also be careful to govern these things in terms of political gain, because it will not be a gain for anyone, but only the destruction of our institutional structures. <p> Therefore, we say, even in these squares, that the road today is not that of demagogy, violence or smoothing the hair of those who, defeated in Parliament, want to remake themselves riding the protest without outlets. <p> The way and the answer is that, step by step, only with the recovery and seriousness are the economic and social conditions built to respond to the tragedy of unemployment, of those who lose their jobs, of self-employment, of employees, of companies and families, who together have to rebuild this country. <p> That is why we shall vote in favour and call on Parliament to approve this decree.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5764606595039368, 0.42353931069374084]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote in dissent from my Group. <p> MINEO (<PARTY>).

The macroeconomic forecasts change and the policy objectives are modified accordingly. <p> In the first field is the positive change in the GDP growth forecast, from 0.7 to 0.9 per cent in 2015, to 1.6 per cent in 2016 and 2017 and then to 1.5 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019. This is a positive picture also confirmed by the most recent outlook of the International Monetary Fund presented yesterday in an international framework of slowing growth with many shadows and very few lights. The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecast by 0.2 per cent this year to 3.1 per cent, and has defined modest expansion. It is the worst global growth since the last crisis: with the focus on the situation of emerging economies, whose slowdown hampers global growth. Italy, on the other hand, together with a few other advanced economies, sees its estimates rising by 0.1 per cent, for a possible 0.8% at the end of the year, lower than that of the Government that is confirmed in the trend and according to the analysts of the OECD also in the dimensions. The International Monetary Fund report itself points out that industrial orders are falling in Germany, confirming the effects on Europe of the global slowdown in trade. In this context, as can be seen in the updated note of the DEF under consideration, the Government proposes a remodulation of the net borrowing rate and the path towards budgetary balance resulting from the use of European flexibility margins. In summary, in the Note we note a net debt rate of general government, in relation to GDP, equal to 2.6% for the current year (according to the trend framework) and equal to 2.2% for 2016, while in the trend the net debt rate is equal to 1.4% for 2016 and the budgetary balance is reached in 2017. As we know, Italy is subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact due to excessive macroeconomic imbalances. For 2015 the Government had requested and obtained a 0.4% deviation towards the medium-term objective for the implementation of a series of structural reforms in the process of approval and implementation in the current year: a possibility foreseen by the Treaties between possible forms of flexibility in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact in the presence of specific economic and social factors. An objective, that of 2.6%, respected despite the presence of an intervention that had to be made necessary after the decision of the Constitutional Court on pensions. For 2016, the government is proposing to Parliament, and therefore to the European Commission, a full use of the flexibility margins for structural reforms, with a further 0.1% being added to the previous 0.4%, plus a further 0.3% of additional flexibility related to the investment clause. The choice that the Government proposes to Parliament with this Update Note and the report sent to the Chambers as required by Article 6 of the law implementing the budget balance is linked to international, European and national macroeconomic scenarios. The growth of the world economy presents a uneven picture, with countries that continue to confirm their performance, as in the case of the United States that grows in the second quarter to a greater extent than expected, unlike Japan that after a first quarter of growth sees a setback and a decrease in GDP in the second quarter. However, it is the slowdown in the growth of emerging economies, starting from China, that worries and produces a possible general slowdown in global GDP growth. The state of world trade also sees a reduction of one percentage point compared to previous forecasts. In Europe, growth is differentiated and, in any case, lower than expected, especially if account is taken of the strong reduction in the cost of oil and the massive quantitative easing by the European Central Bank. It is as if Europe were paying on the one hand for its internal institutional unevenness, for its inability to have a unique subjectivity and a leadership capable of global initiative (not only from an economic point of view) and, on the other hand, for its inability to renew its economic and social structure, in a context in which the economy, if one thinks only of energy and mobility, can become less dependent on the fossil fuel system for its growth, while the demand for urgent attention to the environment grows and while inequalities produce a new demand for social regulation. In any case, to the current institutional system and economic model, European growth does not seem vigorous enough to drive the data of our country alone. The current condition is therefore that of a recovery, but it must be sustained and strengthened. Italy has better data than expected, so much so that the Government proposes an update on the increase of GDP, confirmed also by the interim reports of OECD and Monetary Fund. Consumption is growing, imports are growing more than exports, fixed investment is growing in some sectors, household confidence and industrial production are growing. These are the indicators that allow the government to raise, also for the two-year period 2017-18, the GDP forecasts to a growth trend of 1.3%. Employment data confirm a positive trend. The number of people employed in the second quarter is increasing by 103,000 and, if the unemployed are also increasing, this happens in a context in which the unemployed fall by 0.4%, i.e. those who have given up seeking employment and who, according to ISTAT, now reach a figure lower than in 1993. In this international context of cooling global growth and modest recovery in Europe, the Government considers it necessary to strengthen the positive signals coming from our economy and consolidate them over the next three years, with some choices on which there may be different assessments, but with an economic policy approach, initiated in 2015 and confirmed in 2016, which constitutes an element of discontinuity compared to the past. The choice, faced with an imposing public debt, is not the search for its reduction through austerity policies, but with a wider program of debt aggression through stimuli to the growth of wealth. Only with GDP growth, supported by public policies, and also through the temporary postponement of budget balance and the medium-term objective, thus with greater recourse to debt, can the trend change, increase wealth and thus obtain resources for a structural reduction of macroeconomic imbalances. It is in this sense, therefore, that the greater flexibility granted by the European Commission in the adjustment path imposed by the Community budgetary constraints must be used, and it is in this direction that all the political forces present in Parliament indicated the way for development, putting an end to manoeuvres aimed at austerity without growth. If there is broad agreement on this, it is perhaps on the concrete instruments and the effects of stimulating growth that choices and political confrontation must be concentrated. Now, the Update Note to the DEF deals with the elements of context and strategic choices, but it is the law of stability that becomes the instrument for adopting concrete implementing measures and it is on these that the choices of government and Parliament must focus. The choices have been partly anticipated and among them it is essential, as well as widely shared, the elimination of the safeguard clauses provided for in existing legislation, whose implementation would have negative effects on consumption. Moreover, this is the only instrument through which tax pressure also falls, which would go up by one point in three years to existing legislation - I say this because there has been a debate in the Budget Commission - while, through the removal of safeguard clauses and the impact of the 80 euro bonus measure, it falls to 42.6 percent in 2016, with further reductions in the following years. The elimination of safeguard clauses, worth more than EUR 16 million, the abolition of taxes and the planned extension of tax incentives are covered by expenditure savings and flexibility clauses for reforms and structural investments of 0.8% required by the Commission. In addition to the elimination of the safeguard clauses, the Government proposes to continue in the work of reducing the costs of the structure of the public administration; but, and in several parts it is emphasized the will, it intends to adopt interventions of fiscal policy favorable to the increase, that involve a lightening of the tax burden on families and enterprises. These interventions, which are to be translated into specific measures in the Stability Act, would concern, as anticipated by the Government in the debate in the Commission, first of all the cancellation of taxes on the first house, some taxes on businesses, agricultural IMU and machinery, in addition to the confirmation of some measures already provided for in the Stability Act 2015, such as the bonuses on recruitment, although probably reduced, and the ecobonus that contributed to the maintenance of the productive system of the building, stimulating in part the technological evolution. The financial effects of fiscal stimulus measures would be partly offset by expenditure savings aimed at increasing the efficiency of the public sector, continuing the expenditure review in 2016 and the following years, which ensures a large part of the coverage of tax cuts. In this respect, considering that the reduction in expenditure limits the favourable impact on growth resulting from the deletion of safeguard clauses, the Note considers that the adoption of a more gradual profile of these cuts will ensure that depressive impacts on GDP are lower than estimated in the development of the DEF. On this basis too, due to the need to continue without negative effects in policies to reduce the public perimeter, the change of the medium-term objective and the shift of the fiscal structural balance to 2018 are justified. I conclude my speech, pointing out some critical issues, emerged in the audience, on which the Government has already communicated, in the course of the debate, that it is working. However, I think it is useful to represent them, also because of the authority of the source: these are three critical issues. As mentioned above, the measures in favour of households are included among the measures provided for in the 2016 Stability Act. On this subject the Bank of Italy has emphasized that the frequent changes to the real estate tax of recent years could induce the families not to consider the relief now programmed as permanent. This is certainly an aspect that needs to be assessed, as the impact on the efficiency of the local finance system and on the services provided by local authorities, starting from the fight against tax evasion, also at local level, which can only be achieved in the presence of a stability of the rules, which has been absolutely lacking in recent years, but on which the Government has already expressed its intention to take a certain direction and to confirm it. In the same direction, of course, the observations made by the European Commission regarding the greater effect of stimulating the growth of tax measures on business and work than others should be taken into account, pointing out that not only the content of the measures to be taken but also the sequence of their implementation are sensitive. On this too, the Government has signalled the will, of course we are waiting for confirmation, to confirm a attention to the sequence. Secondly, attention must be paid to the continuation of the spending review process, which appears strategic not only for the magnitudes of public finance, but, in particular, for the supranational credibility of the economic policy implemented by the Government. The reduction of the public perimeter, in the presence of an already compressed expenditure on social security, health and staff, is probably not that quantitative objective for which the clamour of the public is often aroused, generalizing negative examples often individual, but it certainly represents an essential element of institutional credibility in order to maintain the confidence of the citizens on the quality of the intervention of the Government and of the Parliament. Finally, the same sensitivity must be placed in the direction of measures that can support the recovery of the Mezzogiorno, certainly through extraordinary and one-off interventions, but with the awareness that the recovery of the gap of those Regions requires constant attention, which is achieved only through structural investments, the removal of the constraints and the economic and social limitations present and, above all, a stable framework over time, both on the legislative and administrative levels. The constant change of these references, which must instead be a stable framework of intervention and evaluation by the State, also by local public administrations, can be a fundamental element, so that the system of enterprises, even with the interventions put in place during this period, can place the necessary and indispensable attention to the Mezzogiorno.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5188829302787781, 0.48111703991889954]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, today, in this House, the majority would like to send to the attic the Constitution that represented the backbone and armor of our Republic, which ensured the counterweight of the powers of the State guaranteeing the citizens a true democracy, which allowed our institutions to adapt, perhaps not always perfectly, to the contemporary needs. A work that bears the signatures of statesmen such as De Gasperi, Saragat, Calamandrei and Togliatti who today, unfortunately, could give way to this institutional reproach that of democratic principles has very little. <p> I do not dispute the need to change the rules to ensure a truly more efficient state for the good of the country. <p> Certainly we must rationalise the legislative processes and improve the mechanisms that promote the governability of the country. The limits and competences of the State and the Regions must also be defined. <p> For these very reasons I endorsed the reform project, convinced that for such an important change it was necessary to ensure the wider involvement of the parliamentary arc, in full respect of the constituent spirit. A simple concept, clear to all, but unfortunately not shared by the Government and its majority, of which it is an expression that in recent months has wanted a continuous demonstration of strength towards a Parliament now reduced to mere scribbler of the Executive, constantly humiliated and gagged, deposed of its own legislative power. We are still being subjected to humiliations, forced to hold a quota debate; we are being distracted by the authority of this House and the freedom of its members. <p> With the excuse of approval in a short time we do not want to allow the necessary debate that could move consciences and form an opinion, perhaps different, from that man only in command. We must not, therefore, run for reasons of urgency, but rather for the fear that democracy, what our present Constitution guarantees, may overpower that authoritarianism provided for by the new reform but today de facto already implemented by the Government. An imposition resulting from the megalomania of this majority, more attentive to chasing the sensationality of the news and a tweet of tendency than to the realization of sensible political choices. Nothing new. The whole path of this measure is studded with similar outrages: from the replacement in the Commission of some colleagues of majority not in line with the unique thought imposed by the leadership of the <PARTY>, to the changes of the text, always wanted by the leadership of the <PARTY>, to the forced calendarization last week, imposed once again by the leadership of the <PARTY>. And let me say that we could replace the term \"directive\" with \"directive\" which would perhaps be more appropriate. A trend that will only worsen, given the constitutional changes envisaged by this reform, beginning with the reduction of the Senate to a simple armchair of representatives of Regions and autonomous. It will only have secondary functions of control, without ever contributing to the legislative process, when instead the majority of the Western world retains a bicameral system as a maximum guarantee of democracy for the citizens. So humiliating the Senate does not even have an economic value, because the miserable savings will be compensated for with additional costs at the head of the Regions (and always about public money we talk about). The weakening of the Senate means that all legislative powers will be at the head of a single Chamber. Thanks to the combination of constitutional reform and electoral law, as a result of the disproportionate majority prize, the party that wins the next elections, while not representing the majority of Italians, will have control of the Chamber of Deputies, will elect the President of the Republic on its own, will grant confidence to the Government and the President of the Council alone, will appoint the Presidents of all the Authorities and directly and indirectly control the majority of the members of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Council of the judiciary alone. It is the end of that check and balance on which democracy is founded. Legislative power, executive power, judicial power in the hands of one party: it is the end of freedom. In the light of all this, I wonder once again where the constitutional flame that burned in the words of President Mattarella ended when, on 20 October 2005, as a Member of Parliament, he hurled himself against the reform of the Berlusconi Government, which, contrary to the proposal now under discussion, in addition to guaranteeing governance, also provided for indispensable mechanisms of institutional balance. Just now that it represents the highest authority to guarantee the Constitution, why, President Mattarella, is it silent in the face of such an attack on our freedoms? Well to her and to her colleagues of majority, effective and in some way enlarged, I would like to recall the words spoken by Don Sturzo in this Senate on 27 June 1957: \"The Constitution is the foundation of the Republic. If it falls from the heart of the people, if it is not respected by the political authorities, if it is not defended by the Government and by Parliament, if it is tampered with by the parties, the hard ground on which our institutions are manufactured and anchored our freedoms will fail. I hope that these words, which are still echoing in this House so strong and current, will awaken the consciences of all those present to put the country\\'s future ahead of the miserable political game. With today\\'s vote the Senate could once again mortify not only itself, but the whole country, writing one of the poorest pages in the history of Italian institutions.

Madam President, Madam Minister, Mr Undersecretary, ladies and gentlemen, finally after years of cuts in education there is a decree, today, which restores resources and repairs the damage done over the years to the education system. I have heard from the speeches in general debate and in some explanations of vote that some people were asking for a more comprehensive measure. But, I would like to remind you, the task of this Government of service to the country is to rebuild Italy, taking it out of the swamp, restoring it credibility and putting it fully among the developing countries of united Europe. Rebuilding the school together, between different political forces, responding to the most urgent needs I think is good for Italy, so that education and school can be from now on a field of confrontation and not of political confrontation, restoring prestige and authority, supporting one of the highest democratic institutions in the country: the school. If we really want to educate European citizens to meet the challenge, we need to raise the levels of learning and competence of our children, halve the rate of school dispersal by 2020 and double the number of graduates. The competitive advantage of our country, which does not have deposits of raw materials and does not have great extensions, are the well-made heads of our children: the human capital on which it would really be appropriate to invest more in order to have certain returns. <p> 13:34 (Followed by Mr PUGLISI). The decree makes exactly this choice, with an additional option, however, that of returning to support the capable and deserving and deprived of means that, as our Constitution demands, must be able to reach the highest levels of education. In the time of the crisis that hits families hard, the very real risk is that this constitutional principle will be disregarded. Even today too many deserving boys and girls, who are entitled to a scholarship, have to abandon their studies because they cannot afford the study, which should not be considered a luxury, but a right of all. Minister, in these months of your mandate for us, you have followed the right path, rebuilding a climate of trust in the school. In this decree there is no epochal reform (and less bad, contradictory epochal reforms risk dying school!), but there are important innovations that school autonomy, supported by local authorities, can use to improve the quality of the training offer. This decree-law makes some decided choices, which I want to remember. The great national emergency called school building is being put in hand, activating a billion euros (of all the decrees that we have approved since the government was installed), now activating loans to be made available to local authorities and loosening the Stability Pact for those who invest to secure schools or build new ones. The decree-law declares war on school dispersal, along the roads traced by the OECD, focusing on school time and open schools in the afternoon, especially in areas at greatest risk of dispersal. We are back to investing in in-service training of teachers (for many years we have not seen a euro allocated in this direction) to help them renew their teaching, to capture attention and to ignite the passion for knowledge in a generation of students who have a large mass of information, but who often struggle to organize it in a critical and accomplished knowledge, providing resources for the technological innovation of schools and focusing on the dissemination of wi-fi in school classrooms. In this regard, I would like to remind you that only 7% of school rooms today are connected to the Internet. For the first time resources are available for a student welfare system (this is a real novelty), putting 15 million euros at the disposal of the regions for students in situations of disadvantage, for school transport, to facilitate the purchase of textbooks for families in difficulty and to promote the convenient use through the networks of schools. Students with disabilities will finally have the right to enjoy teaching continuity, thanks to the stabilization plan of almost 27,000 support teachers: 90,000 places available will be covered in a stable way. Our first thought must in fact be to support in the study those who start from situations of disadvantage. But on the staff side there is more: there are the corrections necessary to the mistakes of the 2012 spending review, and so, instead of dismissing the 3,500 precarious school secretariats, these people, who work with dedication and competence, will be stabilised in three years; there is also the return of dignity to the unsuitable teachers, who can continue to keep open school libraries or collaborate to keep schools open in the afternoon. Above all, this decree-law provides, between 2014 and 2016, through a negotiation session with the unions, the coverage of all vacancies and available places: so the much desired functional organic will finally become a reality. Another rule of the decree-law that has not been sufficiently valued in this debate is that it finally provides the renewal of the residence permit for reasons of study and training for the entire duration of the course, and no more than year by year. It is an important step of civilization and welcome in our country that we finally make. With regard to access to specialist medical schools there is the positive innovation of the national competition, which will promote the recognition of the merit of young doctors. We thank the Government for having accepted the agenda on the equivalence of the duration of courses to that of Europe, which contains the important recommendations of the Health Commission, to guarantee doctors in specialist training, in the transition phase, the quality of training and the graduation of the effect of the reform, and to define fair criteria of access, with an evaluation extended to the professional activities carried out and properly documented. As far as university education is concerned, the funding of EUR 100 million for the right to study, which is provided for in a stable way, is positive, but, as I said earlier, we know that there are many students who would be entitled to a scholarship in the time of the crisis and who do not receive it because of the limited resources. It is a slap in the face of the dignity that we give to these deserving and devoid of means boys and girls that we can no longer tolerate. That is why, Minister, we will be at your side in the battle, on the occasion of the examination of the stability bill, to find additional resources for the right to study, to permanently unblock turnover in universities, to promote an injection of fresh energies by young teachers and to review the criteria for assessing the funding of universities, as you said in your reply earlier. Evaluation criteria are needed for the financing of universities that really promote, throughout the country (in the Centre-North, as well as in the Centre-South), universities and research institutions of quality, but it is also necessary that this quality has the focus above all of the training of students: they are the future of the country. We want to promote a different quality of growth, which can bring about dialogue between research and industrial development. We will work with you to find resources, not only for industrial research, but also to refinance basic research. We have to. Therefore, continue with tenacity, Minister, in this right direction, to demand from the Ministry of Economy and Finance the resources they serve, because it is only by investing on the school, the university and the research that we can help this country to overcome the deep territorial gaps that cross it; only by investing in knowledge will we be able to restart this Italy. With the good olternism, which I have heard here unfortunately, the precarious do not stabilize, they do not provide scholarships, they do not improve the conditions of school construction and they do not fight the dispersion of students. True reformism is made up of concrete steps forward, such as those contained in this decree.

The abolition of the Provinces will not solve the evils of Italian politics. I have already expressed my thoughts in the past, also because, having been President of the Province, I know the matter closely. The measure under consideration is an incorrect measure in substance and method. I defend the role and function of the Provinces, not only as a bulwark of identity, but also as a vehicle to offer rapid responses to the needs of citizens. The abolition of these institutions or the transformation into second level institutions is an act not only unconstitutional, since it goes to drastically modify the organization of the State sanctioned by the Constitution, but anti-democratic, anti-historical and anti-social. The Provinces historically play an important role in the service of the community. As I said, as President of the Province I have been a direct witness to the role, importance and great results that can be achieved through careful and social administration, even in areas not of specific competence. It is true: the economic situation we are going through is what it is, but giving a sponge to what exists and works today, without knowing what will happen in the future, appears more and more a leap into the void. Demagogy, as usual, is the mistress. The Provinces, together with the Municipalities, are the bodies entrusted with the care of the local communities, privileged places of participation and democratic representation of the popular authorities. The Provinces themselves cannot be considered as the scapegoat for the evils of the Republic, for the resolution of the problems of the political costs. It is clear that a level of intermediate governance of programming and direction is useful. As often happens, an announcement is made without any concrete knowledge of what will be the implementation modalities. Now there are the Provinces, tomorrow the SuperComuni will be born, it seems with new bodies to elect and new competences to redistribute. Everything must be changed so that nothing really changes, with the announced savings that are all to be verified. Each territory has its precise characteristics and its peculiarities. Where there are large metropolitan areas, as in large cities, abolishing the Provinces may have a reason, but in different territories by vocation and characteristics, as it is for most of Italy, all this seems demagogic and dangerous and, above all, goes in the opposite direction to what citizens and businesses ask. Those who work need references, coordination of actions. This role has been very well played by the Provinces so far, representing a real solidarity for businesses and citizens. To think of a long path that leads to consultation to the Region for contingent problems appears a dangerous road, at a time like this when the answers must be ever faster and more immediate. A research by CENSIS, a socio-economic research institute, also claims that the Provinces are more appropriate institutions to give identity and governance to the vast area. To refer to the Province to which I belong, the Province of Avellino, imagine our agriculture managed one tomorrow only by the Campania Region. Public transport, employment centres and the environment are competences that can hardly be transferred tout court to the regions or municipalities, which would not even have enough organisation to manage them. Actually, I would abolish the Regions and leave the Provinces. The concept of Region, at times, is too broad, in the sense that there are large regions with very different problems and characteristics of the territory. There are regions, for example Veneto, ranging from requests for structures for sea tourism to special measures for the danger of avalanches in the mountains. One institution cannot reconcile everything. Italy really needs to reduce waste, but it cannot be allowed that from this need comes a constitutional ruin useful only for the electoral slogans and for the front pages of the newspapers. If the government's objective is to reduce costs, it is good to remember that the cost of the Provinces amounts to little more than 1% of national public expenditure and that, moreover, this measure would effectively cancel only the expenses of the political representation, quantifiable in about 200 million euros per year. Staff costs will remain unchanged, but they will be redistributed between regional and municipal offices. Added to all this is another fact, not economic but of equal importance: to cancel a garrison of democracy, to cancel a level of representation, to cancel a territorial reference for citizens means to be deaf to the need for listening that comes from the communities. All this only gives less certainty to companies and to those who work, removing points of reference. This measure will create an administrative and institutional vacuum, and this is a cost to citizens and businesses. In a historical moment when politics is increasingly in the hands of the nominations one chooses to eliminate one of the last, by now few, democratic bulwarks remained in support of the administrative machine of our country. This is why there is a need for confirmation of the election of the President of the Provincial Council, possibly also considering the posts strictly free of charge. It is paradoxical that we are talking about the abolition of the Provinces and we are not talking about consortia, park bodies and mountain communities. Administrators, with the support of civil society, need to come together to re-launch the real needs of the communities on the political table. To make this happen, it is essential to start from listening, from the vocations of the territories, from local products. For many reasons it is good that the ownership of so many actions is entrusted, as already mentioned, to institutions elected and controlled by citizens who look to the entire territory of destination. Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Government, I believe that a revision and reorganization of the intermediate body is necessary, including by reducing the number of advisers and members of the Junta, but by direct election, as I said before, of the President and of the Provincial Council, even without any remuneration. It is certainly desirable to maintain certain functions, with the necessary corrective measures to be taken, as, moreover, the whole apparatus of public administration must be revised. At this moment, there is a real risk of being deceived by a demagogic climate that sees in the Provinces the scapegoat to be struck to satisfy a public opinion that calls for a more efficient, less bureaucratic and above all less expensive state apparatus. This is a legitimate demand, to which politics is called to give answers, but without deceiving citizens with useless palliatives destined, in the future, to prove worse than evil. Public opinion must be well informed, because - I am sure - the path on which the government has set out will lead to mistakes that will prove dramatic for our communities. I should like to conclude, Mr President, by hoping that these considerations can make the Government reflect in order to avoid posthumous repentances which will then be of no use.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5155134201049805, 0.48448657989501953]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> IANNONE (<PARTY>).

This provision for us, which we have always been for the stabilization of precarious people, is badly thought out and written worse. It has been announced as a save-precari but to us it seems that it is more a \"kill-insecure\", a measure that discriminates and for this reason we have presented a preliminary constitutionality illustrated by our leader Luca Ciriani, because we consider the issue that concerns teachers who have served in peer schools and who are resoundingly excluded from the possibility to participate in the contest.

I make explicit reference to the incredible question of the magisterial graduates who find no solution and continue to remain in this Dante\\'s circle of precariousness; I refer to the story of school leaders who have been forced to resort to the judiciary to assert their rights; I refer to Catholic religious teachers who continue to be treated as children of a minor god: they have been waiting for years for the possibility of being stabilised and once again they are not given a response that can assure a satisfactory chance to carry out their work in a more serene and dignified way; I refer to the story of the DSGA working, people who for many years have ruled the fate of the Italian school, who have earned a dignity and professionalism on the field and who will be substantially \"cestinate\", first used and then abandoned. There was an opportunity to recognize a dignity to our university researchers, but we also found an absolute deafness on the part of the government and the majority. It is clear that there is a lack of financial resources but in this regard I want to say that it would have been enough simply to use the resources now devoted to the income of citizenship to invest in Italian school and education and to recognize to our teachers salaries that are more dignified and more adapted to the noble function they carry out than the Italian society. The OECD report in September makes it clear that the Italian school is in great difficulty and that our teachers are the least paid in Europe. If then, as so much rhetoric says, you really want to invest in the school and the future of our nation, you could simply do this, not ban a competition that will create the new war of the poor and that does not give a full answer to the needs and problems of the Italian precarious. We are talking about 24,000 places in the presence of over 170,000 vacations, so we are talking about a very small measure. Evidently, the government is more concerned with ideological issues. I would like to say to the Minister, whom I do not see in the Chamber, that if instead of worrying about cutting off the crucifixes and dedicating himself to world maps, he would think of the concrete needs of the Italian school we would have some more positive response. <p> We do not know if the press indiscretions that want you to resign soon correspond to the truth, but we are sure that in the next few hours many thousands of people will ask for your resignation.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.717621922492981, 0.28237807750701904]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, it seems to us that the Government has different aims than those stated. It is intended to pass through communications on containment measures of the Covid-19 virus by adopting a decree of the President of the Council of Ministers which is the antechamber to justify the announced extension of the extreme measures of national emergency. <p> Now, it is quite clear that the virus is now being approached in a completely different way, especially for prompt tracking and early diagnosis, which were absolutely not standardized at the beginning of the epidemic. So fortunately, the stress test that our health system was subjected to in March-April will not be replicated. What is lacking is a real system of national pandemic prevention, surveillance, control and international prophylaxis. <p> , to which the Government has listened as a merchant, transferring the chain of territorial responsibilities, also to the world of businesses and individual behaviors. <p> We have had the opportunity to propose on several occasions an anti-pandemic plan, which at least today should be enriched by the very recent experience and the increasing clinical, pharmacological and organizational knowledge, but, as it comes from an unwelcome opposition, it is not even taken into consideration; whereas, instead, with its prompt adoption, the many structural vulnus that have contributed to the deepening of the economic crisis will be resolved. It would be sufficient, as far as the health sector is concerned, to set up a national emergency centre (on the CDC model), by delegation to skills and knowledge already present at the Ministry of Health, such as the Centre for Disease Control, with a steering booth at the top integrated by the Higher Institute of Health and a qualified State-Regions representative. If there is a recurrence of epidemics (a far from remote hypothesis), this directing booth will be able to give timely and prescriptive indications to the Civil Protection on the actions to be undertaken and on the tools to be used. All this on the basis of an updated pandemic plan of prevention and pandemic control, which in fact is a gap that could have already been filled in the conversion of Decree-Law No. 34 of 2020, so as to exclude any need to resort, for the same case, to the state of national emergency referred to in article 7, paragraph 1, letter c) of Legislative Decree No. 1 of 2018, which should not keep to health emergencies, especially and even more in this case, as it would be a déjà vu. If on something new and historically unique it is justifiable that exceptionally decide the Government, of a case not only already known, but now qualifyable to low criticality, it is more than enough that a technical body and that the fundamental prerogatives on constitutional freedoms are subject to careful safeguard, are in essence safeguarded from the risk of possible arbitrary distortions. As I conclude, Mr President, national governance of pandemic control and prevention continues to be disregarded, which is the basis of any anti- and post-Covid programme for the renewal and adaptation of the health system, for a proper balance in prevention, in territorial medicine and in hospital, through corrections to the general rules of engagement and updating of the network, with targeted investments that will allow in the future to have more performance at lower expense. This is to safeguard all the essential levels of assistance (LEA), including those under discussion, information, education, prevention, care and care of infectious diseases and to ensure that the possibility of a new pandemic wave does not have further adverse effects. Emergencies like that of the Covid have hurt, and if it is not remedied they will do more and more, to those who are more fragile, not only from the health and socio-sanitary, but economic and social point of view. Instead of welfare measures destined to end unproductively, it is necessary to act immediately in pandemic prevention, as a fundamental lever for the contrast of social and economic vulnerabilities, precondition of individual and collective well-being and inescapable presupposition for overcoming the economic emergency that we are experiencing.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7950405478477478, 0.20495940744876862]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> Mr Ghedini Rita (<PARTY>).

Then there are also other measures: one has gone unnoticed, but we will also give answers to those employees who have undergone the provisions on food vouchers. We will also bring this improvement, namely the return and replacement of the old food vouchers, after the failure of the society that managed them, which will be relocated, bringing economic gain to families and companies.

In the political distance, interesting points have also come from the opposition senators in the Chamber and in the Commission: from Vice President Pelino, from Senators Castaldi, Girotto and Council. <p> Let us now come to the political points. Like Senator Lanzillotta, and first of all the rapporteur Marino, and then others, I also wonder whether the instrument of the annual law has proved appropriate to promote competition policy. I venture to answer: no, it did not prove appropriate. In fact, the individual ministries tend, and not without reason, to want to define their own reform framework laws in the areas within their competence, if and when they feel able to do so. I am thinking, for example, of the reform of port services, one of the most backward activities of our country that the Ministry of Infrastructure already at first instance, in the original definition of the draft law of the Government, invoked to itself. <p> In fact, history tells us that the most ambitious decisions on competition came well before 2009, when the obligation of the annual law was decided. I would like to mention the main points: the ownership separation of transport infrastructure in electricity and gas from Enel and ENI in order to build energy markets where there was a monopoly; and then the multiplication of telecommunications networks in both mobile and fixed and unbundling in order to facilitate the entry of new operators and the links between telecommunications and television, the establishment of independent authorities. The most recent, among the major, is the Transport Authority that accompanies the competition in the high railway speed. But we cannot forget the shyness. There were those, too. Shyness about motorway concessions and the crew back of tariff improvements. Shyness on the RAI-Mediaset duopoly that will be mitigated not by the foresight of the legislator, but by the technological evolution of the web that makes the old masters of information and entertainment age in the nearest times. I stress, as other colleagues have already done, including Senator Gasparri, the political weakness of governments in the face of the systematic tax avoidance of over the top which creates serious distortions in competition in strategic services such as the distribution of goods and services, the management of personal identity information and advertising; sectors in which other companies, often Italian, operate, that taxes pay them. I am concerned about the weakness of Antitrust and Agcom, even in perimeter of these issues. You see, it is right that the independent authorities exercise a right of stand for government and parliament, but the right and duty to criticize and, if necessary, force the authorities to do their job better remains in politics. Accountability duty goes both ways. Also for this purpose the Senate Finance and Industry Commissions are looking for a solution on the web tax front that recovers resources to the Italian tax and assures to the markets and consumers the correct behavior of the enterprises from the point of view of the competition. I hope that the Government will work together with ideas and proposals, now and perhaps in the 2017 budget law. Here, the pro-competitive political will is not realized because there is an annual law. Or this will is formed because at least the majority are convinced that competition policy serves, and they convince themselves without indulging in rhetoric, but doing the accounts, as they always recommended, even to the PCI of Togliatti, that great Italian who was Raffaele Mattioli; or this will does not form, and then they quarrel, and they make the jokes chiozzotte on your lobby against my lobby, a matter on which the rapporteurs have uttered definitive words. Having said that, we must leave it to the next legislature to give an operational answer to the question that Senator Lanzillotta and Senator Marino asked us: the calendar is tyrant. But Italy, which wants to present itself as the country of reforms, cannot let this legislature pass without having made any decision on competition. If it is true that this law is worth 1% of GDP, it is approved as soon as possible. I'm not so optimistic and I don't think it has this extraordinary effect, and yet I say: House and Senate did a job; let's vote it here at Palazzo Madama and ask colleagues in the House to do the same. This is in order to allow the Government to put in place as soon as possible an annual measure relating to 2017, to be approved in that year. This has asked the Industry Commission in its recent opinion, and this I repeat today in this House. As the rapporteur, Mr Tomaselli, warned, time does not pass in vain. This bill would need some retouching on insurance that has already been defined. An agreement was also reached with opposition forces on more stringent antitrust limits at the entry of financial capital into pharmacies (senator Mandelli spoke about this yesterday). It's not just a deal. I think it's an improvement. Personally, I would add that in some respects the draft law should even be amended. Let me give just one example: the overcoming of greater protection; I also do so for the benefit of the President of the <PARTY>, who has discovered the subject in recent days. Well, if the greater protection in the electric service is abolished without an antitrust roof and without auctions with cost oriented price regimes, we risk crystallizing at the head of Enel, and under the regime of price freedom, 85% of the 23 million customers that today Enel and the other companies employed for the purpose serve on behalf of the single buyer at prices always lower than those so-called free. These customers - I would like to be clear - are not today customers of Enel (i.e. the former monopoly) and of the other parties who exercise the sales service on behalf of the single buyer, but they will become customers tomorrow for inertia. For Enel, on the basis of company documentation (I see that not all those who talk about this matter, including the person I mentioned earlier, have studied it) consider an advantage of at least one billion margin. I do not like this - it is obvious - but for now I am giving up the pressure for an immediate change. I trust that the Government Gentiloni Silveri - in particular Minister Calenda - will look at this issue and the commitments they have made, correcting the approaches of the predecessors. Also in this case, as in others, we will see the Government and the Minister to the test on the occasion of the next measure. These days the vote of confidence has been put forward, which has been repeatedly mentioned in this House, and we know that it will be requested. Such a solution would be an act of responsibility on the part of this House towards the country and the government that must be able to play the competition card in Europe. However, let me say that, given the circumstances and the work done by the Commission, the House and, in particular, the rapporteurs, such a solution is also an act of generosity on the part of the majority and also - I add - the same opposition. It is a generosity - I would like to be clear - that I am sure it will not be rewarded by the cunning of different sign in the third and final passage to the Chamber of Deputies, in order then to prevent the Government from launching the law for the market and competition for 2017.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7232680320739746, 0.276731938123703]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> <PARTY>ROVANO (<PARTY>). Mr President, members of the Government, my fellow senators, first of all I would like to remind you that this measure has been defined by someone as one hundredprorogates, in the sense that it is not the usual one thousandprorogates decree that is adopted at the end of the year. This is an exceptional act due to urgency and urgent needs, so it was decided to extend it at this very moment, before the summer break, which we have specially shortened in the interests of Italian citizens. In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, of which I have the honour to be a member, the majority - the League and Movimento 5 Stars - did a great job of trying to complete the examination of the measure. I would also like to thank my colleagues from the opposition for their active participation in the work of the Commission, having been involved and having contributed. <p> The measure under consideration is extraordinary. We have tried to improve the original text, making changes that go only and exclusively in the interests of the citizens, favouring the small and also the productive world and of the enterprise. <p> I do not want to dwell on everything that has been done in this decree-law, also thanks to the amendments that we have brought to your attention, because it has been discussed for a long time. However, I would like to point out that some issues have not been dealt with, not because they are not important or because they are in the attention of the Government and Parliament, but because this is not the time to discuss them. <p> There are very important issues for our country that need not extemporaneous interventions, but revisions and general reforms. I am referring in particular to the Provinces, since this is a subject which has been discussed a great deal in this House. It's a little weird that it's the <PARTY> that's talking about Provinces and getting angry, because we decided to make an election day for at least 2018 <p> I would remind you that in the Commission it was proposed that minorities extend the measure including those provincial councils that were elected in January 2019: we were told no. So, the proposal came from us, but it failed. As for the Provinces, you may agree or not to keep them, but the big problem is that they were destroyed before they were deleted. <p> I remember that the Minister of the Interior, right here in the Senate, in front of the Constitutional Affairs Commissions of the two Chambers, last July 25 stated that a reform is needed to ensure that this body that exists to continue working for the good of the territories and citizens. It is not true, therefore, that we were not interested in the matter; this was simply not the time to do so. The same applies to local authorities. We have examined the package of amendments relating to the municipalities, but in this case too, except for some commitment from the Government, it was decided to postpone the debate because it was not urgent for August and from here to the end of the year. We'll discuss this later. <p> I would also like to remind you of the important measures adopted by the Decree-Law in question, which primarily concern the areas affected by the earthquake, as well as the indispensable contribution made by the Council of Ministers by extending the state of emergency in Ischia, as it expired precisely in August. But important measures have also been envisaged, such as the one that guarantees children to go to school even in classes where the number of pupils would not be sufficient; extensions have been given for the adaptation of the fire regulations and for the verification of seismic vulnerabilities; and this happens immediately to ensure that children go to school. For the same reason it has been decided not to apply the sanction - I stress the sanction - for those children who have not submitted the vaccination certification. The vaccination obligation has not been abolished, but one of the sanctions has been abolished to ensure that children from zero to six years of age - as well as their companions from six to sixteen years of age - are able to go to school not to discriminate against children, in case their parents have not yet complied with them. This too will be discussed later and, therefore, I find the opposition's criticism very presumptuous, also from this point of view. <p> Another very important measure: we saved the Monza Grand Prix, which, for bureaucratic issues, could no longer take place, resulting in damage not only to the image of the country but also to the economy of entire territories. <p> We helped local television stations, which would risk leaving some 5,000 people at home, because they could not benefit from the contributions granted. Here too, attention has been paid to the territories, specifically to local information, which is fundamental and guarantees attention to our citizens, even with direct links, through commitment on our territories. <p> We have planned a number of interventions with regard to school. For example, we have extended to the academic year 2018/2019 the possibility of resorting to the exhausted ranking for the assignment of teaching assignments in the courses of high artistic, musical and choreutica, and at the same time of sending to the Italian schools abroad the selection of teachers extending the rankings. As far as universities are concerned, we have extended to 31 October the time limits for the committees which are proceeding to confer the national scientific qualification for the roles of university professors. In the field of culture, we have extended - although it is not enough for the opposition - also to 2018 the cultural bonus for eighteen-year-olds. Only measures aimed at the citizens, designed for the citizens, and we have not finished here. We have approved measures aimed at and designed for the citizens, and we have not finished. I wonder how it is possible for the opposition to think that in two months after the government's establishment all the problems that have been caused in recent years can be solved. <p> I also remember the special attention paid to our territories and our regions. For example, we have adopted an amendment in which we have reduced the blockage in the delivery of assignments by the Ministry of Transport for the financing of local public transport. This has a lot to do with everyday life, especially our commuting citizens, but not only, and all the kids who go to school. <p> We have introduced a number of innovations and also helped the people in economic difficulty by suspending the capital share of loans for families in difficulty and we have safeguarded jobs - as I said before - in the territories thanks to the extension made with regard to the amendment called MOCA, in which about forty Italian cities live, through the handicrafts and for the related induced, on the production of artistic ceramics. This is another example of the problems caused by European regulations that do not take into account the peculiarities of our country's productions and typicalities.This is also a clear example, because we are extending something that is wrong, not for the law itself, but because it must be transposed by the member countries according to the needs of local production. Again, many jobs, tourism and the economy of many cities in our country were at risk. <p> I would like to thank once again - I believe it is incredible - that this House is meeting here today, on a Monday in August. I don't know if this has ever happened before... <p> VOICE FROM THE <PARTY> GROUP. Always. <p> <PARTY>ROVANO (<PARTY>). Always? I was told there was a month's vacation, usually. BRESSA (<PARTY>).

I think it is quite unusual that there have been fellow senators who have worked Saturday and Sunday before late in the Commissions also for the decree of dignity. I believe that, if we could discuss the content and not use what is not done as an accusation against a newborn government, perhaps everyone would be able to work a little better and with more serenity for the good of our country.

For the first profile it should be remembered that the need for guarantees for gender representation must find an even more advanced point of concrete relapse in the social events of our country. In this direction, for example, the result achieved by Law No 120 of 2011 that encourages the presence of women on the boards of public and private companies should be reported. <p> However, it is necessary to identify instruments that make even greater use of the presence of women in civil society. However, even in the more specific sphere of politics it is necessary to make a change, although it must be pointed out that many colleagues have already reached very high levels of political responsibility in which they have known and will know how to pour all their professional and human experience. <p> In the matter of elective assemblies, the law n. 215 of 2012 with which they were introduced, in the elections for the municipal councils of the municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants, both the double preference of gender and a quota of list according to which, in the lists of candidates, neither of the two sexes can be represented to an extent greater than two thirds. Similar solutions have been adopted by some regions. <p> In this overall context, the draft law under consideration deals with the way in which the Italian representatives are represented in the European Parliament, but at a time when there is a strong debate in this House about the issue of gender quotas in the Chamber of Deputies when the national electoral law was amended. <p> So we will soon be able to resume this issue in the context of the debate on the measure, which has already been approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 March, further deepening its various profiles. But the fundamental difference between the debate that we will soon be discussing and the debate that is taking place here today cannot escape. In the first case (the national electoral law) we will be confronted with a set of rules, a broad reform within which there are specific issues and among them that of gender representation. A broad reform that is also examined at the outcome of the well-known Constitutional Court ruling and at a time when there is no immediate return to the polls on our horizon. There is therefore time to examine the text drawn up by the House of Deputies with sufficient serenity and thoughtfulness, even in view of the adoption of those changes that have been evoked by several parties, including by authoritative representatives of the Democratic Party. <p> Therefore, at the outcome of the overall work that Chamber and Senate will work on national electoral law, the appropriate stimuli and indications may be taken to adequately evaluate the subject matter covered by the bill today on the agenda of the Senate. It is certainly not a way of circumventing the issue before us, on the contrary: precisely because we want to deepen it properly, we cannot ignore the analysis and evaluations that will be carried out with reference to the text approved by the House. <p> The measure under consideration (here is the difference I mentioned earlier) addresses today, when collecting the signatures in progress, a problem which concerns the formation of lists and the vote of preference for the election to the European Parliament. I believe that at the beginning of the procedure it is not possible to amend the electoral law for the European Parliament. We are, in fact, just a few weeks away from the elections and the introduction of the constraint laid down in the draft law would take place at a far too late stage. On the other hand, on this issue there is an explicit indication of the institutions of the European Union that it recommends not to change the rules of electoral competition in the year preceding the elections. Therefore, a different attitude could be taken where the draft law on the agenda was examined far from electoral competition at European level. <p> The risk that I see materializing is that of adopting on a specific, though relevant, aspect of the mechanism for the transformation of votes into seats a solution which, removed from a general context, may risk conditioning in some way the debate on the draft law which, on 12 March last, was not without difficulty, was approved by the other branch of Parliament. Let us, instead, let the confrontation on this project be distracted to the Senate free from conditioning and inspire us to the solutions that will be operated in that area. <p> Having said that, as I said, I would suggest that at this stage we do not proceed further in the examination of the draft law on the agenda of the House today. As for the lists, I note that it is true that article 51, paragraph 1, of the Constitution provides that all citizens of the one and the other sex can access public offices and elective offices under equal conditions, according to the requirements laid down by law, and that to this end the Republic promotes with special measures the equal opportunities between women and men, but the question to be solved is precisely about the limits and the ways in which these principles are realized in the legislative acts. <p> From this point of view the question arises as to whether, in this context, a mandatory provision to the point to be taken in specific hypotheses to the recusal of the list is in accordance with the constitutional dictation. Among other things, a mechanism for deleting the names of candidates belonging to the most represented gender is envisaged, in order to ensure compliance with the principle that candidates of the same sex cannot exceed half of the number of candidates on each list and that when, following the cancellation of the excess candidates, the list contains fewer candidates than expected, the list is rejected by the circumscription electoral office. I would like to point out in this connection that in this way the will of the tens of thousands of voters who have signed the list is distorted (this is a number which, I recall, varies on the basis of Article 12 of Law No 18 of 1979, from 30,000 to 35,000 voters). The alternative would be to have to redo the lists without, however, being able to take advantage of the legislative time provided for the collection of signatures, thereby creating a clear disparity of treatment. To this end, however, a transitional rule would be necessary, but, as the Government has pointed out in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, it presents profiles of unreasonableness, being able to determine precisely that discriminatory effect between the lists participating in the electoral competition that I have now highlighted. <p> I realize that this is a specific aspect of the legislation that we are discussing today, but the effects of this and the constitutional concerns that arise are, in my opinion, symptomatic of the need for a substantial postponement of the examination of the issue in the sense that I have previously highlighted. <p> I remain convinced, Mr President, that the guarantees for gender representation should also be accompanied by primary standardisation measures aimed at encouraging it, but the choice of time when to implement these interventions is not indifferent to the better achievement of the result, and that is why, finally, I repeat the position I have outlined in wishing for a pause for reflection on the draft law.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6312100291252136, 0.3687899708747864]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> IN MAY (<PARTY>).

Perhaps the fundamental problem for us who are a legislative assembly - although I think we have quite forgotten about this function - would be to identify the causes. Well, if we have to identify the causes, perhaps it would be better to ask why this wretched industrial policy has allowed such polluting sites to be placed in inhabited areas. I wonder then if our hypocrisy can have a whisper of dignity and perhaps begin to look at what we are doing at the moment, because with the decree unlocks Italy perhaps we are opening a whole series of new construction sites that will bring other tumors and other deaths and I would not want a tumor in the South, in Basilicata or Sicily, to have a different dignity compared to the tumors of Piedmont. We're doing exactly that. We should be asking ourselves about our function and whether the laws that we vary in this House may or may not be significant in relation to the celebrations that we are then, I repeat, with great hypocrisy in this House.

Several times, in fact, at the various meetings that were also held by previous governments in the area had been established a figure by the Government for the realization of the compensation works. It is useless to be scandalized: in Italy there is no large infrastructure, both railway and motorway, with which compensation works are not combined. If we want to eliminate them in the future, Parliament can certainly intervene, but up to now in Italy, precisely because of the morphology of the territory, compensation works have been and are in my opinion indispensable.

These will therefore be crucial issues, together with those of immigration, Brexit and the others mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, for the future of Europe. <p> The Digital Single Market Strategy, adopted in May 2015, needs to be progressively but rapidly implemented with the aim of improving access to digital goods and services across Europe for citizens and businesses and fully grasping the growth potential of the digital economy. <p> The Italian Government has already taken a decisive role, together with some European partners, in the desire to continue decisively towards the digital single market. At the same time, the Italian Government is committed to accelerating and strengthening the march to structure an appropriate ecosystem for digital innovation in our country. Unfortunately, despite the efforts made over the last two to three years, we are still at a disadvantage compared to many EU countries. The OECD report published a few days ago places our country at the bottom of the ranking on the degree of progress of technological transformation. We must not ignore this reality. I am convinced that only from the knowledge of our delays can we better share the need to continue a commitment to recover lost time. Our country has accumulated, since the beginning of the years 2000, delays in the infrastructure of broadband, in the digitisation of public administration and our productive apparatus. This has led to lower efficiency in the public system in the provision of services to citizens and businesses and in the production sectors, reduced competitiveness and loss of value for our economy. A serious delay that we have begun to recover in the last three years, with a really very decisive reversal of march, undertaken first by the Renzi Government and then by the Silveri Gentiloni Government. I am referring in particular to the investments and measures provided for in the ultra-wideband plan and the Industry 4.0 plan, which are giving an extraordinary boost to innovative investments, digitisation and research investments. A lot of progress has been made in recent years: awareness of the benefits of innovation has grown and incisive measures have been taken to give adequate support to businesses, stimulating collaborations with universities, research institutions and startups. It is not necessary for me to dwell on this point, the government knows well what the country needs. I am sure we share the belief that only through investment in science, technology, research and innovation can we give momentum and strengthen that economic recovery that significant indicators tell us in our country. The confirmation, not discounted, in the fiscal maneuver for 2018 of the continuation of Industry 4.0, which evolves in Enterprise 4.0, the support to investments of small and medium-sized enterprises, the structural incentive for youth employment, the recruitment of 1,500 researchers concretely demonstrate the attention of the Government on this front. Digital innovation is certainly not the only element, but it is certainly a strategic factor for growth. While it is true that Italy is lagging behind the challenge of digital, it is true that the European Union as a whole is, and the common area of work is still large in this area. Europe is lagging behind, politics is all behind in addressing the huge issues posed by the digital revolution. However, even at European level, in 2016 and 2017 we have made very important progress. I am referring to the issue of data protection, the cross-border portability of online content and, above all, the abolition of roaming charges and the agreement on free Internet access in public places. These are very concrete measures, which help to improve the perception of a European Union closer to the demands and needs of its citizens, especially young people. Answers that are also useful to counter false perception, driven by populist forces, of European institutions and decisions far from the real life problems of Europeans. For the future, the EU strategy aims to further expand the digital economy. According to a Community study, the economic value of data will increase in Europe from EUR 300 billion in 2016 to EUR 739 billion in 2020. The latest Community statistics also inform us of an exponential increase in cyber attacks, which has increased by 300 percent since 2015, with 80% of European companies having suffered at least one cyber-accident during the last year. These data highlight, together with the urgent need for an appropriate regulatory framework, the need for the completion of the Digital Single Market by next year. The transition to digital Europe requires specific priorities: high-quality communication infrastructures and networks; public administrations and public sectors fully adapted to the digital age; highly skilled education and training systems; increased investment in research and development; a common approach to cyber security and an updated tax regime. In short, it is a question of accompanying and supporting the ongoing process in Europe, in the public sector as well as in the private sector, because in the global world, to lag behind in the use of new technologies related to digital means to be destined to irrelevance. In the context of the enormous upheavals caused by the digital economy, security and defence, control of the phenomenon of radicalisation, emerge among the crucial issues. On this level, large web operators, which have huge amounts of data at global level, can and must cooperate with the European institutions. The European Union's attention to cyber security has grown a lot, but now it is time to establish a uniform regulatory framework. Finally, I would like to mention the issue of web tax, on which there seems to be a willingness to proceed with a common legislative proposal, a directive, in the spring of 2018. It obviously has economic repercussions, but it also has an impact on fairness: it is not ethically acceptable that there are companies that do not pay taxes, without neglecting distortions in terms of free competition and competitiveness. In short, it is also a question of applying to the digital economy what applies to any other economic sector, the principle that companies must pay taxes where they produce profits. I would like to point out, in this regard, that the huge revenues that could be derived from the web tax in Europe could be used in a profitable way for training and job creation for our young people. I wanted to conclude by mentioning the importance of integration in the digital field, which is an important basis for European integration. There is no future for our country without the European Union, the Union cannot be fully achieved without its full social and political realization. We need more Europe, we have seen it well, suffering from its shortcomings, in the event of the serious unfolding of the Catalan affair. Sixty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which was commemorated today by the anniversary of the establishment of the European Economic Community, we have the task and responsibility of being able to renew and continually update the inspiration that led the founders of the European project to achieve what appeared to others as an impossible dream.

After the intervention made authoritatively in the Chamber by Senator Falanga is excluded the flaw of use, so I see that there is the possibility of taking note of common sense, but in essence in the majority there is a softer position in the application of preventive measures for crimes against the public administration, but it is as if everything came from the window. Therefore, in order to avoid this hypocrisy, I have tabled amendment 1,500/9 to replace the words: 'finalized to the committee by some of the following: 'i.e. to the rapporteurs, pointing out that this amendment did not fundamentally change the principles on which we fought in this House and which were authoritatively supported by Mr Giovanardi. The aims to which we refer are in fact precisely the confrontation in which any public administrator, with such a measure, is absolutely subject to find himself, with situations that cannot be healed except with a long period in which the right is substantially lacking and the protection of the defence is absolutely lacking.

Madam President, I apologize for not being present, but outside the Senate there is a demonstration on vaccines and so I had the opportunity to interface with someone who was there to plead the cause. I'm gonna talk about something else tonight. I refer to a few press articles a few days ago in which the President of INPS, Tito Boeri, stated in some interviews that we do not need to close our borders and that, on the contrary, by closing our borders, we risk destroying our social protection system. In this interview he insisted that immigrants make a very important contribution to the financing of our social protection system. He also showed off data and patterns. Without them, the deficit for the Institute's coffers would be EUR 38 billion. President Boeri, you must be in your place. Everyone does their job: you do the math and try to retire people at a dignified age and not at a hundred years of age. Some counts were to be made when the Fornero law was in place, which has not yet been resolved as a problem at the level of pensions. His accounts make water from all sides and above all his reasonings. There are 1.8 million foreigners active in this country, but there are also 2.1 million of them on the system that do nothing. I would remind President Boeri that ISTAT has recently reported the loss of 51,000 jobs, unemployment at 11.3 percent (a very optimistic figure in my opinion) and youth unemployment at 37 percent. It would be enough to bring back to Italy half of the young immigrants abroad in the last five years for reasons very often related to work. It would be enough for them to solve the problems. So, President Boeri, do not take the place of Parliament in certain political choices, especially at a time when the approval and debate that exists on the ius soli is creating several frictions both in the parliamentary classrooms and throughout the country. While we are at it, I take the opportunity to tell you that perhaps it would be better to analyze why Italian couples do not have children; perhaps you should understand why kindergartens do not work as they should. You can't hand it all over to the school, but even this one may not have the opportunity to offer the kids the best of what they could give. We should be concerned that 29 percent of Italians, or about 17.5 million people, are at risk of poverty and social exclusion and in the South we reach about 47 percent. President Boeri, we do not need anyone; it would be enough to put all the unemployed in the country into order, to recall the young people who represented a social cost because they were trained in Italy and we would settle the accounts. If you are so good as to be able to give work to 100,000 people who come to our country and make up resources, we are happy, but do not make statements that do not compete with you, especially at a particular time for this country. We have seen what happened with the enfant prodigies of European policy. I'm talking about Macron. Someone said that a Macron a day took away the immigrant from home, but this solved the problems of France in about a week of his work and dumped them, as Germany and Austria did, on our country. If they are resources, they should be resources for the whole of Europe; instead, they become resources only for us. Welcome if we find the job for all these kids. I believe, rather, that we should put our unemployed in a position to find a job.

Mr President, thank you and I thank all my colleagues clearly. I speak with a great sense of responsibility on behalf of the Brothers of Italy Group on the motions we are discussing. Today is February 5th, a date that stands - I don't know if casually - between two days equally important for our historical memory: the Memorial Day of January 27th and the Memory Day of February 10th. These are two dates that recall tragic moments in our European history; two dates that recall atrocities that certainly go beyond politics and history. Moments that must remind each one of us, from left to right, how man on too many occasions has not been able to live up to that humanity that should characterize us instead. And, therefore, if so, I can only welcome the invitation that has been made to us in some of the speeches that preceded me to vote cross-cuttingly and unitedly on the motions that have been tabled. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the Brothers of Italy have demonstrated and demonstrated their consistency: in fact, we did not want to present a further motion on the specific subject, precisely because we believe that a united motion should be voted on. On the other hand, we would like - and in this regard we would like to call on the House and the Presidency - to soon discuss a wider motion on anti-Semitism, such as that which the Brothers of Italy have lodged since last year, which wants to make sure that this historical phenomenon is justified and debated in a broader dimension, assessing the dangers which unfortunately today - and not yesterday - concern this situation. I am referring in particular to anti-Judaism, which unfortunately pervades today not only the most extreme and reactionary fringes of the right and left, but also - alas - that Islamic world which today is lived as a grave danger to the very existence of a people and also of a country such as Israel. We therefore hope that we will soon be able to broaden our reasoning on this issue. On the substance, as I said, we are absolutely in favour. President, we believe that reflecting on the day of memory means reflecting on how to protect individual freedoms and human beings today, beyond any characterization of race, religion and political ideology. We therefore welcome all initiatives that want to bring more culture and knowledge. When we talk about culture and knowledge, we must talk about cross-cutting culture and knowledge and of course no one must be afraid to open their closets and deal with their past. I say this honestly and proudly from the right and I am sure that we will also be able to do it on the other political side. Certainly atrocities cannot be colored and must be condemned regardless of historical, political or temporal parts. We must therefore protect the memory and make our young people especially aware of the atrocities of the past on peoples who - alas - have had to serve human evil. I am of course referring first of all to the Jewish people and to what happened to the Armenians, the Kurds, the Ukrainians and the many political opponents who, in the various realities of our world, yesterday and today, are unfortunately discriminated against, vexed and killed for their own ideas. It is not a memory of the past, but it is a perpetuation in the present of human atrocities that we must condemn precisely by reminding ourselves that history is truly magistra vitae (teacher of life) or, at least, it should be. We can only refer, as a political synthesis, to the European Union's resolution which, of course, condemned all totalitarianism and which, by doing so, wants to condemn, without barriers and fences, the atrocities of the past and the situations of the present in which, unfortunately, the human being as a man and a person continues to be denigrated. As far as the journeys of knowledge are concerned, it is certainly a good thing that we can learn not only from textbooks. It is good that by using the senses that nature has endowed us (view, touch), but also feelings and feelings, our young people can go to the places where these tragic events have been consumed. Of course, the financing and economic support that we, together with you, ask the Government to implement these journeys, go in parallel with a greater overall interest in the school system. Let us remember that we cannot wash our conscience by taking only one part: if we really want to create young people who represent the democratic future of this country, we must invest in school and educational institutions. It is therefore an appeal that I address to the Government in this sense: for Brothers of Italy - and I repeat it loudly - I support these journeys, but we should also, and above all, support all our schools and educational institutions. Mr President, there is a reflection that I want to make in order to clarify a misunderstanding that has arisen in recent months, when we and part of the centre-right were accused of not applauding our fellow Senator Liliana Segre. Precisely because this is not the time for partisanism and partiality, I would like to make it clear that at that moment the abstention vote of Brothers of Italy was linked to the fact that we wanted a Commission that had greater anti-Semitic value and was less instrumentally usable, as we have clearly said, perhaps for the purposes of censorship. The vote was therefore specific on the Commission and had absolutely no reference to the figure of our colleague Liliana Segre, to whom I confirm here all our closeness and the warmest and most fraternal embrace by the community of Brothers of Italy. <p> I take this opportunity, also on behalf of our President Giorgia Meloni, to renew her invitation to be present at our next national festival in Atreju. <p> In the light of this clarification, I really conclude by reaffirming the vote of Brothers of Italy in favour of the motions, which, in our opinion, should recompact in a united motion and represent, beyond any fence, the will of a House of Parliament to be a Chamber of freedom and dignity of the human being.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5228654146194458, 0.4771345555782318]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> DIVINE (<PARTY>).

According to the Institute of Hydrogeological Research and Protection of the CNR, there have been 1,443 incidents in the country since 1960 between landslides, collapses and floods, with 4,122 deaths and 2,850 wounded. In fact, in Italy, almost 82% of the municipalities have problems of hydrogeological risks: in fact, 1,700 of them are at risk landslides, 1,285 flood risk and even 2,596 run both dangers, with the result - to be precise - that in fifty years in the country something like 500,000 landslides have occurred. <p> According to the CRESME (Centre for Economic, Social and Market Research for Building and Land) damage to the disaster in the last sixty years costs 52 billion euros for repair, while it needs another 40 for good prevention. In the last four years, the investments of the Ministry of the Environment to keep the hydrogeological risk under control have been almost zero. It was an unfair cut and we don't understand why. <p> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Government, do we really think we can save by cutting the funds for the prevention of hydrogeological risks? That is the question we have to ask ourselves. I do not think so, because it is certified that the State, in the event of disastrous events, risks spending at least ten times more, precisely because, in the absence of targeted interventions, the costs of repairing damage and removing mud flows are enormous. It is one thing that has already happened for the floods of Veneto, Tuscany, Marche and Campania, for the landslides in Sicily or, again, for the alluvial events of the past months in the territories of Emilia-Romagna and Liguria. <p> To better confirm, I will mention only one fact: in 2007 the estimated value of the damage caused in the different regions was 0.035 percent of GDP (one percentage point of GDP is worth about 14 billion euros), without of course considering the victims and the million people involved. <p> Nevertheless, it must be denounced that in the country, with a territory torn apart by the Alps in Pantelleria, these risks are often still ignored and neglected by those responsible for spatial planning, justifying their fatality, when in fact the calamitous events are systematically presented now in one region, now in the other. To speak, therefore, of unpredictability or geological surprise is irresponsible, precisely because the defense against risks and hydrogeological disruptions is imposed in terms of prediction and prevention. <p> Unfortunately, Italy still lacks the culture of environmental recovery, which in fact translates into prediction and prevention. We do not realize that the country is at very high risk and needs to be cared for and cared for because it is extremely subject to structural fragility. From us we should impose prudence and urban intelligence, blocking the continuous derogations from the urban regulations, the abusive and invasive constructions, the wild cementification and the unconsulted predation of the territory. Instead, it should be invested, with appropriate forms of territorial planning, on the prevention works and especially on agriculture, which cannot be abandoned, because, together with the woods and pine forests, presidia and care the territory and its vegetative structure and, as such, it is the true paladine for the fight against drought and hydrogeological risk, degradation and climate change. <p> There is therefore an obligation for the Government and Parliament to adopt redevelopment policies in favour of agriculture and its strategic value as a fundamental and unique garrison for the consolidation and extraordinary maintenance of the territory and the environment, in order to counter the desertification of the hills and mountains for the repetition of calamitous and emergent episodes ever more serious and difficult to resolve with the abandonment of the countryside and rural spaces, especially by the younger generations. <p> It is clear, therefore, that integrated interventions and environmental prevention, together with the plans to secure the territory, are the only ones that can interrupt in the future the hydrogeological criticalities. Not to mention, then, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, phenomenologies of the rest quite present in our peninsula. <p> In our country we are always late on environmental policy issues. In September 2012, after the ruinous collapse of one of the most beautiful walks in the world, the way of love, at the Cinque Terre, the Minister of the Environment of that time, Clini, declared that a national plan for the prevention and security of the territory would be made immediately. Unfortunately, after a year, we are still waiting. <p> In order to understand the importance of the problem, the culture of information and risk prevention should be re-launched, with active participation in particular in schools and among young people. <p> It must be realised that a plan for the reduction and management of hydrogeological risks is an extraordinary instrument for economic and employment recovery and as such must be addressed, overcoming the approach to one-off or absolute urgency interventions which - designed on the basis of the emotions of the moment and, I would add, of particular interests - are not always able to solve the serious problems associated with the hydrogeological problems of soils; such critical problems that, at times, constitute a serious threat to the loss of naturalness and biodiversity. Unfortunately, Madam President, we are reminded of intervening with integrated programmes for the protection and hydrogeological maintenance of the territory together with environmental redevelopment only with the emergence of emergencies in order to forget them, as if for enchantment, immediately a minute later, and then to talk about them again at the occurrence of the new calamitous event. We therefore need a serious and responsible policy, starting with the establishment of a single authority for environmental emergencies and hydrogeological disruptions. It is not possible that for a disaster the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Region, the Province, the Civil Protection, the Forestry Corps must still intervene: in the end you never understand anything! Is it possible, Mr. Representative of the Government, to unify the interventions so that there is only one body, a single authority in charge of managing that event, that calamity that always causes deaths and disasters? Moreover, in Italy we have forgotten the importance of a reforestation policy; I do not know how many years there have been no reforestation programmes. We are also lacking in the ordinary maintenance of rivers and waterways. In this respect, authorisations and concessions for the production of hydropower should be planned. Mr Undersecretary, let me explain to you what happens in this area: with an authorization of 1933, this production was granted to ENEL who, in times of serious difficulty, opens up the invaders by ensuring that the avalanche water arrives on the rivers, with considerable damage to people before and after. I believe that this motion is an act of great responsibility of Parliament and the Government in order to activate the minimum forms of security, aimed at allowing greater serenity for our territory.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5784252285957336, 0.42157474160194397]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, we come to this appointment for the reform of the honorary judiciary after a long itinerary in the Commission, a cross-action between draft legislation of parliamentary initiative, draft law proposed by the Government and a long series of reports and hearings in the Commission of the interested parties, honorary judges, honorary vice prosecutors and judge of peace. We come up with a draft delegation law that defines criteria and principles that we have tried to articulate in the most detailed way possible to clearly define the framework within which the Government will have to move to put its hand on a very complicated matter that takes into account different needs. The first principle, of course, is that of justice, the Italian one, which needs a series of rationalization measures for its operation. Today, in fact, one of the elements that least guarantee social justice and effective justice in this country is precisely the bad functioning of the judicial system, due to its cumbersomeness and to some structural issues that make ours one of the countries in which it is most difficult, both in criminal and civil matters, to succeed in reaching a judgment in certain times. We know what this means, not only in terms of harming the rights of people directly engaged in different ways in a judicial process, but also in terms of harming a general right that, for example, keeps away from our country important economic investments precisely because of the difficulty of being able to rely on the judicial system and therefore on a system of guarantees, rights, rules and respect for the regulations really effective and efficient. The reform of the honorary judiciary represents only one aspect of the work that this Government and this parliamentary majority have been carrying out for a long time. There are already a number of actions planned by the Justice Commission and others will come to the Commission and the House to define a more general reform of the proceedings, and also of the same process. Here we are talking about an important aspect, which is how we manage support for the ordinary work of the judiciary that we decide to entrust to the honorary judiciary. It is clear that up to now there has been a gap between the formal definition of these figures and the way in which they were actually used, starting from the deficiency of the system. In fact, the difficulty of carrying out proceedings quickly through recourse to the ordinary judiciary has developed a use of the honorary judiciary and the abnormal peace judges in relation to the objectives and functions assigned to them. On this too, we try to make clear from a point that I think is acceptable: to avoid that contradiction that has been created over time between magistrates who access the ranks of the judiciary by ordinary competition and a sort of alternate judiciary, which goes to carry out tasks of support for the ordinary judiciary when the ordinary judiciary fails. This bill of delegation therefore aims to identify an autonomous space, a defined space for the honorary judiciary. Therefore, it is to be welcomed, in my opinion, that simplification that reduces to two the figures of the judges: on the one hand, the honorary judge of peace, placed in the office of the judge of peace, but which can then be addressed by the president of the court to the office of the trial, which represents one of the most significant innovations compared to the more general reform of the justice that Minister Orlando is trying, one piece at a time, to put into order and, on the other, the figure of the honorary prosecutor framed within the prosecutor. It is also a good thing that it is more clearly defined that these figures are actually honorary and that, therefore, they perform the function not as a priority job or as a predominant activity within their professional function, but as an additional activity. From here, the definition of a time of three - in some cases four - four years for possible confirmation of the assignment after verification, since the standard duration of use of a professional as an honorary magistrate is equal to four years. It is also important to have clearly defined competences. I would like to stress specifically that it has been decided to keep out of the duties of the Honorary Judge of Peace the treatment of proceedings in matters of employment relations, pensions and compulsory assistance, which remain in the function of the ordinary magistrate for their particular delicacy. Among the amendments tabled, I would like to highlight two of them which are particularly important. Amendment 2,320 states that the honorary magistrates in service may be confirmed in office not for three, but for four four-year term of office. Ladies and gentlemen, there is one very important issue that this measure must deal with very, very sensitively. We are going to redefine a new and lighter figure also compared to the professional investment of the individual, because it is, precisely, a function carried out only for a part of the life and additional to the main activity exercised. We cannot ignore the fact that today, for the needs of the system, we have asked many people to perform the function of judge of peace or honorary judge, in fact, as a predominant activity for very long periods of their lives. It is therefore clear that, when we lighten up (let me use this word in the sense that I explained it better before) this figure, we must consider the professional and human investment that every judge of peace and honorary magistrate has done in the years in which he has performed this very delicate function. For this reason, with reference to the theme of the transitional regime, the extension to four years of the possibility of reconfirming the current judges and judges of peace, also moving a little later the time of the beginning of the term, i.e. from the entry into force of the legislative decree to the entry into force of the last of the legislative decrees implementing the delegation contained in the provision. I would remind you that this amendment was made by the Justice Commission. The other important amendment that I would like to focus on contains a different articulation of the allowance, differentiating the remuneration attributed to the honorary judiciary into a fixed part and a variable part. This is probably a way of making the most of a figure which, as already happens today with the judges of peace, will be attributed a series of functions and affairs not clearly defined, but variable from the numerical point of view and, therefore, of the commitment over time. I hope that later we will be able to express our opinions on the implementing decrees of this delegation, verifying and realizing how the plant that we have built today can actually represent a regime transition from the situation before the new situation that we are going to outline and above all that the operational application of the reform that we are about to launch can represent an important part in the simplification of the work of the judicial offices, which our country needs so much.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5607112646102905, 0.4392887055873871]}, {'sequence': \"I welcome the G15.1 and G15.2 agendas. <p> With regard to the G15.3 agenda, the Government is in favour of accepting it as a recommendation, or with a rewording in the part of the operative part of the following text: It commits the Government to consider considering, for the purposes of the definition of measures and incentives.......................................................................................................................................

The current Government has given the whole country a clear signal of change. <p> And this is the first step of the Government of Change. How many times have we witnessed, in recent years, European summits talking about loyal cooperation, solidarity (for the management of immigration above all), a common policy? How many handshakes, how many words in the wind, to pretend the existence of a united and supportive Europe! Italian citizens in recent elections have realised that they have been fooled by governments that have proved incapable of moving from words to deeds in relations with the European Union, in particular on the issue of immigration. Italy has been abandoned to its duties; the European border has now moved north of Europe. <p> Someone called the political action of this government to be pukeable and this someone, France, is precisely that country that closed the borders of Ventimiglia and that is responsible for the shameful fact of Bardonecchia, when the French authorities closed the doors to a pregnant and sick Nigerian woman, then died after the birth. <p> Just that country has rushed to deny the willingness to welcome the ship Aquarius last morning. <p> We do not accept lessons of civilization from France or from any other country, even from Spain of the barriers of Ceuta and Melilla, and we do not accept lessons of humanity from political forces rejected to the ballot box by the voters and that have reduced this nation to the present state, especially in the field of immigration. <p> The uncontrolled management of migratory flows has led, over the last four years, to more than 15,000 deaths at sea and has cost us billions and billions of euros: what happened has absolutely nothing to do with the immigration that I have experienced. You have to be clear: the only way to keep these people from dying at sea is not to let them go through those tunnels of death. <p> Organised crime in North Africa continues to handle trafficking in human beings and we cannot continue to manage this phenomenon alone, nor to deceive, with goodness, thousands and thousands of young Africans compared to a future in Italy that is difficult for our young people themselves. <p> This government, unlike previous governments, calls Europe to its duties, awakening the conscience of the international community and asking with the facts and loudly that Italy not be left alone once again: and, who knows why, when there is someone who asks or decides to change things really, everyone criticizes without advancing half a solution to the problem. <p> Mr Salvini, we deeply appreciate your balance, your wisdom, your courage and your common sense, with which you have finally begun to solve this problem. <p> IWOBI (<PARTY>).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Carla Accardi, one of the most original artist of the Italian post-war period, suddenly disappeared in Rome on 23 February. She was born in Trapani in 1924 and would turn 90 on 9 October next. Defined the \"lady of Italian abstractionism,\" with her painting she has contributed since 1947 to the affirmation of the pictorial current in Italy. After graduating from high school, L. Ximenes in Trapani, moved to Palermo for his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts. Since 1946 he has been in Rome where he frequents the Osteria Fratelli Menghi, a famous meeting point for painters, directors, screenwriters, writers and poets between the 1940s and the 1970s. The decisive encounter is with another Sicilian, who fled the island at the same time as her, the brilliant and influential Antonio Sanfilippo, who became her husband in 1949. In 1947 with Attardi, Consagra, Dorazio and other painters, he founded the Group \"Forma 1\". This is how Italian abstraction is born. Courageous, determined, enterprising, ambitious, always looking forward: a key character disappears in the creative dynamics of the Italian post-war period. An exemplary career that starts with political ethics. It became, in fact, a symbol as one of the first women to find space in an environment until then rather masculine. In those first years of the postwar period he helped to bring to Rome a breath of Sicilian energy. They came from Sicily, in short, the first and most powerful Italian creative instances. Eight Biennials behind, prolific and vital, belongs to that generation of women who, since the 1940s, has decreed the end of the marginalization of female creativity. Among the pioneers of feminism in Italy, he is part with Carla Lonzi of the group \"Rivolta Feminile\". In 1964, one of her solos at the Venice Biennale imposed her on international attention. In the seventies her research led her to the \"Tende\" (Tende), real habitable and travelable structures, and in the eighties the experimentation of the raw canvases from which they leak chromatic drafts of various intensity. In 1995 he also participated in the exhibition The Italian Metamorphosis in New York. In 1996 she was appointed a member of the Accademia di Brera and in 1997 she was a member of the Commission for the Venice Biennale as advisor. In the portrait of Carla Accardi traced by Marco Vallora, one of his beliefs is highlighted: to find transparency, in everything; also to get out of the cage of painting, in order to let the freedom of thought and its knotted analytical mechanisms float. Carla Accardi said of her work: The interest for me was transparency, in fact you could see the chassis. I wanted to make what was around us transparent. Remembering Carla Accardi today is paying homage to a woman, a Sicilian artist who brought the city of Trapani into the history of modern art and who was able to express courageously, freely, proudly her ideals and her talent, claiming with her art and her political battles the female genius.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.8673426508903503, 0.13265733420848846]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> NISINI (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the <PARTY> Group gives a positive overall assessment of the two documents under consideration. The first thanks go to the College of Quaestors, composed of Senators Arrigoni, De Poli and Bottici, and to the professionalism of the employees of the Administration of the Senate, the Secretary General and all his collaborators. The report just presented by Mr De Poli has been more than exhaustive and has highlighted a clear improvement in the accounts both in terms of the containment of expenditure and the rationalization of services. Thanks to the commitment we have made to reducing expenditure, including through greater attention to the issue of environmental impact and the digitisation of documents and processes, we can say that we are on the right path both from the point of view of the result of exercise, and that of the inspiring principles that have led to considerable savings in expenditure. As you can see, moreover, the financial weight of the Senate on public finance has been reduced in seven years by about 255 million euros and the budget has been reduced by as much as 151 million since the beginning of the last legislature. These figures indicate that the containment of expenditure is not simply a commercial, but a structural commitment that the Senate institution has taken with its citizens in years in which the economic and financial crisis has made all its weight felt on businesses and families. Another important signal is due to the rationalization of expenditure through the process of integration of the administrations of the Senate and the House, which led to the birth of the Parliamentary Documentation Pole and the Parliamentary Computer Pole, as well as the strengthening of the existing Parliamentary Library Pole and a closer collaboration between the Historical Archives. The continuation of rationalization of expenditure on staff, parliamentary allowances and social security expenditure are all measures that we appreciate and that we hope will continue in the future. The above-mentioned cost containment has not, however, affected the quality of services, as can be seen from the data listed in the report, which show that the Senate is a very virtuous body in terms of payment of invoices, with times within 36 days and with 98% of bills paid; these are very positive numbers that put our institution before the EU average and countries like France and Spain. Similarly, we welcome the timetable for public recruitment competitions, as decided by the Presidency at the end of July, which will allow about 120 new entries as coadjutors, assistants and parliamentary secretaries by the end of the year. The commitment to achieving savings from investment is certainly to be recorded. Evidence of this is the voices that concern investments in extraordinary maintenance aimed at redevelopment and energy efficiency, environmental protection, extraordinary maintenance aimed at the elimination of architectural barriers and those aimed at the redevelopment of areas adjacent to the palaces of the Senate; interventions that we hope can be realized as soon as possible, which will bring additional savings on the accounts and a better use of the spaces. With the great awareness that even today our country is going through a long period of economic crisis, we must feel the responsibility to manage the resources of Italians with attention and sparingness. We must not forget that we are all here representing the people and we cannot allow ourselves to disappoint their expectations. That is why, aware that we are on the right track, we are sure that the College of Quaestors and the Presidency Council and all of us will make a commitment to continue along this path. For all these reasons, we will naturally vote in favour of the documents under consideration.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6658645868301392, 0.3341354727745056]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, in principle, our Group and I personally are opposed to motions of individual mistrust, because we believe that the responsibility for government actions is collective. It must be said in this case that certainly Minister Toninelli has passed to the honors of the chronicle more than for the positive or even negative actions of his Dicastery, rather for his words and his attitudes and for his being at the center of the journalistic gossip. I don\\'t know how bad it is, but it is. In addition, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation on the shoulders of Minister Toninelli is not merely administrative, as for other Dicasteries, but we could define it by another name, perhaps more imaginative, the \"delegacy of the future\": the infrastructures of a nation strictly stick to its ability to stay within the future and intercept progress. This, Minister, is the most negative aspect - in my view - of what has happened in almost one year\\'s management of the delegation. I would like to recall very briefly that, when the Government settled, it had on the table works for about 23 billion euros, that I try briefly to summarize: the Third pass of the Giovi along the axis Genoa-Milan, for a total value of 6,2 billion, blocked by the cost-benefit analysis of the famous commission of the professor Ponti; the Brescia-Verona axis, approved by the CIPE, for 2 billion euros, with additional act signed by the Italian Railway Network with the eneral contractor, blocked also this from the famous commission of the professor Ponti; the axis Verona-Bivio Vicenza, work approved by the CIPE for an amount of 2,7 billion, for which the subscription of the act integrating Italian Railway Network and the general contractor is being carried out, but also in this case the work is blocked by the commission of the professor Ponti. Then there is the Vicenza-Padova, final project available, including the node of Vicenza: there is no need to make the race, there is special concession to the general contractor, but also in this case the work is blocked by the mythical professor Ponti. With regard to the Naples-Bari axis, for the realization of the participation special extraordinary commissioner is previewed, this time with full powers: currently two lots have been entrusted for a total amount of approximately 700 million euros, the remainder is of 3,4 billion euros and the commissioner, currently managing director of Italian Railway Network, could entrust the various lots utilizing modalities that transfer to the winners of the contests also the drafting of the plans. For the Palermo-Catania axis the amount of the work is attested to a value pairs to 5 billion euros and for the realization of the participations is previewed special extraordinary commissioner with full powers; currently is excluded the first lot in the area of Himera and nothing has been entrusted. Also in the latter case the commissioner is the current administrator of Italian Railway Network: he could entrust the lots using the modalities that transfer, mentioned above. From this list, if the government wanted to, it could immediately unlock works for about 23 billion euros. <p> Here, Minister, I have a legitimate doubt: isn\\'t it by chance that the money mentioned is no longer there? It is not by chance that what you did with the last financial, namely the cut to Italian Railway Network of 2.6 billion euros that blocks virtually every activity throughout 2019, like you did for all the works that I have just mentioned and that were not - attention - of the previous Governments - neither that Gentiloni, nor the others - but were residues of the infamous - as the colleague suggests - objective law? That was all she had on the table. <p> But then, what have you done with those resources? Can you tell us that, Minister? You see, with respect to the words for which you have passed into history, we also record the story of the dismantling of the merger between Anas and Ferrovie dello Stato, almost a making holes and filling them at the first opportunity. <p> Explain to us, Minister, why, when a Minister speaks, he does not speak a senator, a free citizen or a spokesman for the Movimento 5 Star: he speaks the State and, in front of the words of the State, people trust, he still tends to trust, despite everything; companies do their projects and local administrations decide their investment plan. Therefore, to have assembled the blessed fusion between Anas and Ferrovie dello Stato - and then we also know who has actually brought benefits, at least in the current state - and then to decide, after a few months, to disassemble it, generates within the two companies a state of uncertainty and indeterminateness and the decision-makers, the managers and the boards of directors wait to understand what happens. <p> Do we need to reassemble this merger? Tell us, Minister, because it is not enough to exclaim, or rather: before you declare you should be sure that you can do it, because otherwise all this really causes irreparable damage to your Dicastery. <p> I start to conclude by saying that unfortunately the ten minutes available are few, even to describe nothingness. <p> I quote the story of Central Italy, of the famous and infamous Quadrilatero, the story of Astaldi and what is happening with a huge number of businesses that are jumping like chestnuts on fire. Those companies have worked, Minister, and the work must be paid. <p> Work cannot be crushed within a procedure and the overfinancialisation of each contract and project. <p> You said that you would put your hands on the procurement code, that you would cancel the notorious practice of the general contractor: where is the reform of the procurement code? <p> It has been a year since you took office, Minister: in a year many things are done, but very many. <p> Colleagues, I repeat that, as far as we are concerned - but you will say it better than I do Mrs Santanche speaking in an explanation of vote - we are not more fascinated by the motions of individual distrust, also because I believe that the numbers of this House can already make us know what the outcome of the vote on the motions we are debating today will be. But let us take advantage of this passage - and this is the meaning of my speech - to be explained by the Minister, whom I imagine he will make a reply and clarify some passages, what he is doing, because we would like to understand that. We would like to understand what is happening in your blessed Ministry, as you spend the day, as you fill eight, ten or twelve hours of work. You have to explain this to us. <p> An entire nation is waiting; there are firm works, commissioners ad acta, extraordinary commissioners.

It is the reality in which (I remember a fairly recent episode) there was a solidarity contest to contribute to the reconstruction of the theatre La Fenice, destroyed by a fire. There is the idea that Venice belongs to the whole world. <p> This must finally influence the actions of this Parliament and this Senate, starting tonight, after the will initially expressed by ministers Clini and Passera in the government of 2012, later supported (and supported even by dates and mechanisms) in the meeting that took place on November 5, 2013, thanks to the will of ministers Orlando and Lupi. They intended to start a path aimed at ensuring and protecting that this extraordinary and unique reality in the world cannot be by anyone and for no reason affected by the ignavian and irresponsibility of men and women of our time. <p> With the motion that we have signed, at the first signature of Senator Casson, (as was done with other motions illustrated with the speeches that we have heard) we wanted to open a window to emphasize that we all agree that this is a city that cannot suffer any risk like what is perpetrated every day, in fact, because there is a staircase that does not return. The great ships that transit to Venice once were modest regarding the context, under the 40.000 tons, but then they have arrived to 80-90.000 tons. Well, the design that is foreshadowed from 1 November 2014, thanks to the initiative of minister Orlando, is that according to which the ships should reach the maximum 96.000 tons. <p> On the one hand, as it has been correctly emphasized, there is a huge increase of the international crocieristica, and well come because, besides a value that I consider cultural, there is an occupational value for the induced one that derives from it. But on the other hand it cannot stand in the scale of values to see ships that reach and exceed 120-130.000 tons, if this can result not only in a damage to the long understood as aquifer basin, of which we have perhaps talked relatively little, but even in a damage to an irreproducible and unique urban context in the world. <p> From this we started to say that we must intervene. We must make in way - this is the extraordinary bet - to reconcile the possibility that Venice continues to be indicated as a destination in the international cruise and as a destination of travel (because objectively I believe that it is indispensable to consider it as such), safeguarding it however within its delicate and already today strongly discussed and questionable balance from the point of view of water, environmental and other. <p> As an environmental commission we held many hearings in Venice to listen to all those who had something to say about employment, tourism, port activity as well as the existing difficulties, as for example an engineer of the Institute of Hydraulics of the University of Padua, who explained to us what are the tensions already existing within the lagoon of Venice. <p> We have drawn conclusions from all this. We believe that it is possible and necessary to intervene in order to find an alternative way to that of the channel of Giudecca, currently used for routes of this nature. We know that from November 2014 there will be the limitation of the tonnage, and the ferries that have a different function of journey regarding the great ships from cruise will no longer be able to dock to the usual port, but they will have to choose another path in order to enter Venice. We know that there will be a significant reduction in traffic and I believe that this has been properly and balancedly accepted by everyone. <p> As Senator Bonfrisco has just mentioned, we are talking about more than 4,000 workers and we are all more concerned today than ever about maintaining employment. We must therefore find a way of reconciling this with the need to intervene on a subject not even for a moment thinking that we can make a different choice without making it transparent and participatory. <p> I believe that this is today indifferent and mandatory, which means that we must bring home a result that sees at the same time the beginning, the start of an active and operational path, functional to obtain the result and at the same time that this result is understood not only by the residents of Venice, but by the whole planet Earth, which in Venice looks with that special eye that made President Obama and Merkel say certain things and that it has made incredibly reflect and ask for immediate and possibly effective solutions to a problem of the nature of what has been placed. <p> I therefore very much welcome the fact that we have spoken, although unfortunately the time is now too late this evening, but tomorrow we will conclude the examination of motions with explanations of vote. I really hope that there will be a unanimous vote on a motion that we are trying to construct as a summation of the various motions and wills, making clear points starting from the rapidity in the area of transparency. It is a good bet for politics, Madam President, to act in the transparency that must be there, because if we succeed others in Europe we do not understand why we do not have to succeed, since we have nothing to hide. At the same time, we must put in place actions that are clear from the point of view of how the choices we have to make are made, which are effective, because they will achieve the objective we have set ourselves. <p> At the same time, they will succeed very quickly, as is normally understood to be due to a fact of this nature. It will therefore undertake a path participated, but fast, in order to reach the objective to save Venice and at the same time the occupation, especially port, that the tourist Venice is able to give, and above all to make sure that the visits certainly welcome of all those who love it continue, but that they want to arrive through the sea.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6248915791511536, 0.37510842084884644]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, Minister, there is a question of method which seems to me to be more serious than the request for an opinion at CNEL.

I would ask colleagues who are not interested in the debate to leave the Chamber. NENCINI (<PARTY>). There is one issue that I would like to make in a preliminary ruling, and that is perhaps equally important in relation to the opinion of the CNEL. If we discuss such an important decree when there are 72 hours to its decadence, it means that one of the two Chambers has retained the provision for an abnormal time. So, we solved the question of perfect bicameralism by introducing, in fact, the system of alternate monocameralism. It has happened other times that the Senate has argued against the House in turn doing so. It happens for the second time in the Senate - which I remember, in very short time - to discuss a significant measure without having the opportunity to make amendments. I shall finally make a proposal to the Minister and the Undersecretary who follow our work and I hope that, for that reason alone, they will be accepted and made. That in which the Carrozza Decree-Law moves is a framework that we can share: it is an innovative framework in some ways that have already been underlined by the rapporteur, and that for reasons of time I do not remember, but it is a framework that, at the same time, the competent Minister reminds us to fit into a sort - and it is not his responsibility - of a lack of piggy bank. In other words, a number of problems and problems to be solved are reported, but at the same time the issue is put in the light of a piggy bank defect to deal with them and bring them to a solution. I will leave out the assessments that stand at the head of the decree, which concern our identity and our consideration far superior to what Italy represents today in terms of knowledge, culture and education. We are children of an extraordinary history, but we are no longer children of an extraordinary present. In some ways, indeed, if we look at the many statistics, at least European, we can say that we are out of the norm that considers many countries in the fields of education, knowledge and culture above a level of normality that we have descended for some time now. There is one point, Article 1, for which I use the minutes I have left, on which I welcome the Minister and I am surprised at the behaviour of the competent Commission in the House. Article 1 has been made - I believe - an extraordinary error when the title of merit has been deleted in the allocation of contributions and benefits, expunging it from the article of the decree. I stress this because, when we talk about merit, many times certain left considers it a theme completely outside and beyond its membership. On the contrary, the question of merit is absolutely attributable to the reformism of the left. I say this because merit is one of those categories through which it is possible to consider scalable the social hierarchy, even if one is part of families that belong to the world and to the category of need. <p> Without evaluation of the merit, there are no scalable social hierarchies that Minister Carrozza, Pisa, knows very well to have been emphasized several times also by the university that has seen her for many years rector. I say this because on this point the Senate, if it had the opportunity, could have re-introduced, amended an issue which the House, in the competent Commission, has expounded. <p> The other point concerns - here too the issue of merit - the question of so-called virtuous universities. We can discuss the award of the \"virtuoso\" title to some Italian universities, but what we cannot do, from this point of view, is to launch an evaluation, in money attributable to these universities, cutting funds that instead had to be recognized. <p> On the other hand, in Article 5, I welcome the theme of teacher training and the use of cultural heritage. In an amendment, I would have suggested linking it better with tourism and those involved in government tourism. <p> The same favorable theme is that of the fight against school dispersal, too high in Italy. While, at the beginning of the 2000s, it was born of the possibility that many boys and girls could enter the labour market immediately, unfortunately, it is no longer the case today: they do not enter the labour market and only move away from the school world. <p> Finally, I would have added an amendment (withdrawal) concerning deserving students working away from home. We now have an extraordinarily large number of Italian families who have children who study far from their cities of residence, families that are no longer in a position to support those children. Many of these children are deserving, that is, they have the courage and the competence to continue studying outside their hometowns, but families are no longer able to support them. I do not know whether the House is in a position to produce an agenda in that direction immediately. <p> We have presented a series of agendas, accepted by the Commission. Three of these, Minister, are related first to the multiclasses and a roof for students to be placed within the multiclasses, second, to the associated professors and, third, to university researchers. These are - I repeat - agendas which the Commission has taken on as its own. Now there is no possibility of submitting amendments to the House (the rapporteur explained this very well). What we can do is ask the Minister - and therefore the Government - that the agendas that the Commission has launched and the agendas that the House will pass be assumed as the responsibility of the Government, not just as an address. I am well aware that the agenda leaves the time it finds; I also know very well that, if it is assumed under the responsibility of the Government, it can have the value of an amendment: the political value of an amendment. I repeat, Mr Secretary: the political value of an amendment. I know you can\\'t change the norm. But if the Minister assumes the responsibility to give an assessment of the agendas that the Commission has launched and to assume them as its own, we are in a position to overcome the time issue, the issue of intermittent monocameralism, and to hand over to the Government a document that is shared and included in the institutional wake of the rule, even if not amended.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6761303544044495, 0.3238696753978729]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> ALBERTI CASELLATI (<PARTY>). Mr President, this essentially united agenda is first and foremost an exercise of common sense, an exercise which, unfortunately, the institutions have not always shown themselves to be able to carry out. Since the beginning, with the original presentation of our motion, Forza Italia has faced the delicate question of the crocieristico traffic in the lagoon of Venice with the awareness of having to combine the respect of the places with the respect of the people who in those places live, operate and work. We have therefore placed ourselves in critical way towards the temptations times to face the question of the crocieristico traffic in the port of Venice only on the wake of pseudo-environmental appraisals, like moreover we have always considered that we cannot act on the emotional wave of single cases of chronicle (whose truthfulness and effectiveness are among other things to the screening of the judicial authority), when the economic future, the occupational future, the social future of a city and an entire productive basin is in ballo. For this reason, the Forza Italia Group has supported its motion with conviction, as well as with conviction will vote for this shared solution, which considers a good and just synthesis between the environmental needs (I mean the real ones) and the safeguard of hundreds of medium-sized and small enterprises and thousands of workers. Not doing so would have meant not taking into consideration the reasons for sustainable development, able to combine the protection of our historical-artistic heritage with the needs of tourism-cultural enhancement and enjoyment. The economic data relative to the crocieristico tourism to Venice and its repercussions on the territory are already mentioned in the course of the discussion that has been carried out yesterday in this House. Here I want to remember some for their objectivity and relevance: 4.255 employees occupied for a total aggregate expenditure of beyond 430 million euros; almost 1.800.000 crocieristi the year, that they represent in this within the third place in Europe (after Civitavecchia and Barcelona) and the absolute primacy like home port (terminal port). I could add a lot more to these. I will confine myself to the most striking ones. In the decade 2002-2012, the number of crocieristi to Venice is increased on average of 13.1 percent every year, with a trend that, albeit contained, will remain positive also for the next three years. The port of Venice has therefore become strategic for the entire European crocieristico section: the 89 percent of all the increment of the passengers recorded in the last decade is attributable to such type of traffic. This characteristic determines a demand for local goods and services certainly greater than that one would have if the ships were limited to transiting in the Venetian port. The development of the Venetian crocieristica is essentially attributable own to the increase of the relative traffic to ships of tonnage superior to the 40.000 tons. In 2012, 93.6 percent of passengers arrived in the city on this type of ship. Local value added represents 3,26 percent of the GDP of the City of Venice and 0,96 percent of that of the Province. The occupation represents 4.1 percent of the total employed of the City of Venice and 1.19% of those of the entire Province. The investments made in these years on the port of Venice represent a fact that the ruling classes have the obligation to keep well in mind when talking about building alternative scenarios. Over the last decade, a future for tourism in this area has been built with great sacrifices. Throwing everything away would have been frankly criminal. On such an articulated and complex theme, for the obvious and irreplaceable repercussions just mentioned, we cannot therefore demagogy and we must identify the best possible solutions net of any desire for degrowth or current temptations to exploit, for it is not well known what pseudo-environmental interest, the current situation in order to pursue models of absolute cultural backwardness. The result of these settings would have been certain: a real economic disaster. It is not by chance that in these days the representatives of the world of enterprise and work of the Province of Venice, in a statement - also in this joint case - have launched an appeal to all the political forces that goes in the direction proposed by us from the beginning and warns against the risks associated with the adoption of improvised choices. An appeal signed by the Venetian representatives of Confindustria, Confcommercio, Coldiretti, Confesercenti, Cna, Confartigianato, Cgil, Cisl, Uil and Chamber of Commerce. Not listening to them would have meant completely ignoring the economic and productive reality of the territory. The role in crocieristico within the port of Venice, as I have already evidenced citing data and consolidated tourist flows in the last decade, is that of a real hub passengers of the Mediterranean. A reduction of this role could not fail to have direct repercussions on all the other landing places, starting with those that insist on the Adriatic, opening the doors to our foreign competitors, ready to make golden bridges to the shipping companies to take the place of Venice. So it is not just Venice or Veneto, but the whole Mediterranean basin; what, for example, would have been the consequences for Bari? It is said that the tourist value of the lagoon city is such that it could hardly be replaced without a loss of attraction of the individual offers on the market. This is out of the question, but also only to lose - in a medium-term perspective - the role of hub, in order to find himself perhaps in a few years to make the deal with a simple Venice destination of passage for the cruises in the Mediterranean, would mean to reduce for infinite times the economic and occupational returns and, at the same time, to frustrate the efforts and the investments carried out in these years. It is therefore necessary, by all political forces, as well as by all social and economic organizations, to make far-sighted choices, able to ensure a true development of tourism - and cultural tourism in particular - in order to place the incomparable Venetian historical, artistic and cultural heritage at the center of development not only in the coming years, but in the coming decades. That is why we are convinced that the text that we will be voting on shortly is a strong signal and a direct stimulus to the Government to intervene with judgment and effectiveness, inspired by that common sense that has been affirmed in this House and demonstrating that our institutions are still able to speak to the country, understand its needs and provide concrete answers. Speaking of culture, tourism, our universal heritage as strategic resources for our economy - and Venice is a clear example of this - imposes a responsibility towards every possible virtuous solution of development. On the contrary, an irreparable disaster would have taken place against a vital productive reality, demonstrating once again to the Italians that not only can we not overcome the current economic crisis, but it is even aggravated by suicide measures.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5596151947975159, 0.4403848350048065]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what are we talking about when we deal with poverty? Paraphrasing Göran Therborn, a Swedish sociologist, we could say that poverty, extreme inequality, is a violation of human dignity. It takes many forms and has many consequences: not achieving a standard of life, defined by one\\'s own society, which allows the minimum acceptable in terms of survival means in fact premature death, i.e. less expectation of life, bad health, humiliation, subordination, discrimination, exclusion from knowledge and/or from where social life mainly takes place, impotence, lack of self-confidence, opportunities and possibilities of life. It is not only a question of the size of the portfolio, to put it bluntly: it is a sociocultural system that reduces the capacity, respect and sense of self of the person, as well as the resources to participate fully in the life of the community. In the public debate the data we have quoted and all these indications become more and more known and the people more and more aware. Istat\\'s data on Italian poverty tell us that 1,582,000 families, or 4.6 million people, have crossed the threshold of absolute poverty and about 6 million are in relative poverty. They are devastating: in 10 years, since the beginning of the crisis, the increase is 155%. Madam President, I would like to reply to Senator Cioffi saying that we have not abandoned utopia (we will never do so), but we are living in reality and the reality tells us that if the crisis is responsible for the dizzying rise recorded, let us not forget that we are offering a backwardness of intervention by the legislators who have succeeded each other over the years and which make our initiative not further procrastinable. However, it is difficult not to see how the welfare state, which has had an important role in the past, now has to change structurally if it wants to be incisive, because the world around us is changing. Changing the forms of production and allocation of resources, the way in which wealth is formed, creates unequal societies within and between them, within the framework of complex and hard globalization, as well as increasingly intensive technological development. The bill delegates that we go to approve, even within the intrinsic limits of the same and in the difficulties of the national context, moving having in mind this framework of reference, theoretical and practical. I want to say a few words about the debate that accompanies the measures on poverty. In this year, but hopefully even more in the election campaign, we will often talk about poverty and talk about it in the media. Although many associations, civil society actors and intermediate bodies have been working on the subject for years, the Senate incardination of bill No. 1148, presented by Senators Catalfo, Puglia and others, certainly has the merit of having placed the theme with great force. And yet, one of the reasons why we are talking about it and talking about it is not related to the content, but to the possibility with which certain politicians and certain media can manipulate its meaning, making the public believe to propose one thing while they are proposing another, because the terms in the debate often become elastic and misleading. Let us therefore make it clear that there can be no debate on citizenship income, because no one is proposing citizenship income. Citizenship income indicates a universal and permanent transfer to each individual, who complies with certain minimum requirements of membership of a society, without any limitation related to the economic condition and without any obligation to fulfil in order not to lose the benefit. To use the classic example of the philosopher John Rawls, it should also devolve to those who surf all day in front of the beach of Malibu and I believe that we cannot afford this and fall into utopia. It is clear in the text of the law that I quoted on page 4 that citizenship income is an ideal model. What is proposed in practice - and I quote again - is a first step towards policy choices towards the adoption of a system aimed at reducing social exclusion and increasing the possibility of the development of each individual within the framework of modern organized society by introducing selective criteria with respect to the benefit and beneficiaries, including the ISEE which has been contested. Gentlemen, here we are in the area of inclusion income or various minimum incomes, not citizenship income. This is also recognised and emphasised in the hearing of the President of Istat. Returning to the draft law we are dealing with, the House text could not be amended in order to be able to implement the measure as soon as possible and to make contributions in the current year. There will be a further possibility of working in the Commission with the implementing decrees. We can say, however, that now, for the first time in its history, even our country finally introduces a national measure with a universal vocation: the income of inclusion, an economic support, of course, with a personalized activation project, carried out by local authorities on the network with all the services of the territory. A universal measure, valid throughout the national territory, which, through the gradual increase in resources and the principle of reality, taking into account financial constraints and sustainability, establishes a Fund for the fight against poverty for a national plan, to which the resources given by the absorption of certain partial measures already in force and additional appropriations decided by other measures will be added. The measure will initially be addressed as a priority to families with minor children or with serious disabilities, pregnant women or unemployed people over 55 years of age, according to the principle of the progressive confluence of existing national experimental or one-off benefits, with the aim of gradually covering in recent years all people in poverty, overcoming any category reference. On the basis of the experience of the main European countries and the work of experts in the sector, access to the measure is governed by evidence of means and linked to the acceptance of work and social reintegration projects. In defining the benefit, account shall be taken of the economic condition of the household and its relationship with a reference threshold for the identification of the condition of poverty itself. The personalized activation project will be carried out by the multidisciplinary teams formed by the Municipalities united in the social and health fields, on the network with all the services of the territory: a plant already provided by law n. 328 of 2000, that the bill intends to strengthen and that I think the administrators know that it works. The measure makes a precise choice to ensure the effectiveness of the interventions: to focus on a strong collaboration between the various institutional levels and a strong integration between different subjects (Comuni, centres for employment, ASL, third sector) at district level, strengthening the network of services through the use of European funds and defining stable methods of associated management. After years of experimentation that, for different reasons, have never seen the goal (even because of the zeroing of the kopecs implemented by you, dear colleagues of the center-right, when you have taken the money away from the funds for social policies), we resume a long interrupted road, taking a first step towards the construction of a real measure of minimum income of inclusion, re-aligning our country to the founded solidarity vision of the European model. We know from the literature data on the subject, as from the practices already in place elsewhere, that these measures do not produce the \"poor lazy\" as some believe. Far from it. It is shown that continuous and effective support, an intelligent take on, promotes family and personal activities that lead to work to overcome the difficulties of life. The poor is poor. If he throws in the towel, it\\'s because his community throws him in the corner and forgets him. Of course, there will be problems and difficulties in a country with variable geometries, where the diversity of territories is also evident in the diversity of territorial structures able to support the maneuver, where the economic situation demands that we proceed gradually. We will therefore need to monitor the continuous and regular influx of the necessary funds, we know that. Having said that, countering this intervention involves not only explaining the reasons for the difference between those who do not want, step by step, building a universal social protection, starting from what can be done today, and pointing all the chips on that one would ideally want. It also means telling the citizen that he waits - something, but waits - that, being unable to give everything now, we decide not to give or do anything. Who will explain it in the squares, in the markets, to who is in line for a hot dish and a coat? Can you explain it to those who sleep in cars? We really wouldn\\'t be able to, and, to be honest, we wouldn\\'t even want to be.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6362140774726868, 0.36378583312034607]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, Mr Senator, for more than half of the 20th century, in our country, the subject of extreme poverty and poverty, rather than of individuals or individual households, has concerned the normal living conditions of vast territories, if not of entire regions. We are certainly talking above all about the South, but also about vast areas of Central Italy and North East. Some of these territories have long been considered among the poorest in Europe and, between the fifties and the seventies of the last century, not only for post-war reconstruction, but above all with policies of redistribution of income linked to national economic growth, millions of people came out of the condition of extreme poverty, as never before in Italy had happened since its foundation. From the seventies onwards, this tells us all the statistics, the incidence of poverty remains in our country more or less stable. <p> The crisis, lasting over six years, and the presence in Italy of more than five million foreigners from countries among the poorest in the world, have determined, in recent years, the very evident finding of a phenomenon that can further expand in the coming years, with the risk of the sliding of entire classes, which until a few years ago we would have defined as average, towards the abyss of insecurity and economic uncertainty. <p> The greatest concern is one element that distinguishes new poverty from those of even a few years ago: work is no longer sufficient to remove the risk of poverty. Today, in our country, you can work and not have the means of sustenance adequate for yourself and for your family. This can only change the state's approach to poverty. Today, social assistance for citizens is largely shared by the municipalities, although in recent years the role of the regions that have almost all legislated in the fight against poverty has gradually increased. In most cases, however, these are measures which we could define as experimental and however very marginal, measures limited in time, with little funding, which have never allowed the construction of a stable and certain system for citizens and homogeneous throughout the national territory. Only a national legislation, contained in the 1999 Finance Act, had provided for the so-called minimum income of inclusion, a regulation which was certainly also experimental, which was growing over the years but which the 2004 Central Right Government had abandoned to propose different instruments such as that mentioned also this morning of the social card. This is more or less the national framework on which the need to find new tools to combat poverty has arisen, and I say new because the needs of millions of people in our country are also new. This is how bill No. 2494 was born. A framework of experimental and territorially divided instruments is opposed, for the first time, to a homogeneous and universal instrument, a tool that is born today but obviously needs to grow over the years to start with a much greater endowment. That of homogeneity and universality, however, seems to me to be the preliminary point but also the most significant one, in particular for future application prospects. It is not the State of solidarity that does charity to some citizens but it is the State that applies the second paragraph of Article 3 of the Constitution, taking on the direct responsibility of removing the economic and social obstacles that effectively limit equality between citizens. With regard to these ambitions, how is the draft law currently under consideration to combat poverty and social exclusion of citizens? First of all, through the introduction of the income of inclusion, providing for an essential level of benefits to be guaranteed throughout the national territory, a universal measure, conditional on testing the means on the basis of the ISEE, with personalised inclusion projects that do not end up in mere economic endowments but also concern the services to the person. The reference to families and in particular to those with minor and disabled children, to pregnant women and to over fifty-five years of age without work is fundamental. It is also important to reorder benefits of a welfare nature and to strengthen the coordination of social services interventions in order to ensure essential levels of benefits throughout the national territory. We then come to the promotion of territorial agreements between social services and other bodies and bodies competent for employment, education, training, housing policies and health in a close relationship - as never happened in our country - between the public, third sector and private social. Madam President, today we have a measure which certainly does not have the ambition to solve definitively a problem that has a huge dimension, especially when compared to its impact with our public budget. Senator Cioffi, this is not about utopia; if anything, it is - I don't know how to say - not to make fun of millions of citizens, especially the weaker ones. <p> It means ending with the rhetoric of a saving measure that is written on paper but does not indicate where to find the tens and tens of billions of euros that should instead support it. <p> We have some more certain and probably less eager ambition, that of a measure that needs much more substantial endowments than what is planned today, that must confront the unknown of its effective application in the different territories of our country, but that has the merit of associating the theme of poverty with that of the rights of every citizen who is in extreme need not to be left alone by the State. <p> WOMAN (<PARTY>). You leave them alone! ANGIONES (<PARTY>). The measure will initially be able to address just over 400,000 people or families. It will be said that it is little compared to the millions of people who would need it, but it opens, in any case, a new way in our country, building a system that empowers the State to take charge directly of its operation. It is little more than the beginning of a journey, but with this measure today we are taking a significant step in the right direction. I think I can say that this significant step forward is being taken in respect in particular of the weakest sections of our citizens to whom we turn and say: with the scarce economic resources on which the State can rely today, that is what the State can do. Everything else is not utopia, but rhetoric and mockery of these citizens.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.54532390832901, 0.45467609167099]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again in this House dealing with the issue of banks. It has already been mentioned earlier that the Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banca Etruria have been mentioned here. And I quote this bank to remember the four banks that were saved on that occasion. The bankers were saved. Really this government, like the previous one, is very strong with the weak and very weak with the strong. He's more of a sheriff than Robin Hood, just to give an example. <p> However, the issue of banks needs to be addressed, otherwise there is a risk that we will still be talking about this difficult situation in the next parliamentary term. And then we will enter into the specific substance of this measure, as other colleagues have already done and will do tomorrow Senator Carraro in an explanation of vote for our Group. The truth is, there's banking suffering. <p> The measure under consideration is wrong and, we say so immediately. Among other things, the question of trust has been raised and we could never feel like trusting this Government, which is doing so badly, as the Government of the former abusive premier, Renzi, has done badly. In fact, things are bad, and banks are bad because the economy is bad and the government does nothing to help the economy and employment. Banks are bad for two reasons. Today we are talking about two Venetian banks, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which represent what is called the golden triangle of the country: Padua, Vicenza and Treviso, that is the locomotive of the North-East. Today we are not talking about the Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), which has been managed by left-wing politics. We are talking about banks which, together with other banks, are those of the rich North-East. There will be, then, a reason if things go wrong. Certainly some things have been done wrong and we are talking about the culprits. I have seen that Minister Padoan said today that it is necessary to pay those responsible. Frankly, it seems to me that I have to say that. It is clear that those responsible, where there are, must pay. I am surprised, however, that a government minister, on the day that we are discussing this measure in this House, on which the question of trust will be voted on tomorrow, has to specify something of this kind. Honesty is in fact a prerequisite and is a necessary condition, but not sufficient, because then you have to do things well. As I said, things are bad for banks because they either lend money to people and companies that shouldn't have them, or because people who were solvent are no longer able to meet their commitments. Where there are such profiles, the judiciary will take care of them. And things are bad because the economy is not working and the country's overall picture tells us that only Greece and Cyprus in Europe are doing worse than we are. In Germany the economy pulls: in this regard we see what they have done in Germany and Great Britain for the banks. We cannot think of coming here to discuss only Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza: we discuss the system. Those who spoke before me recalled that in this House we discussed the Monte dei Paschi di Siena and the four banks, including Banca Etruria. There is therefore a problem with the general system. If the economy doesn't pull, I wonder where the measures taken by the government are to restart it: we are zero comma. Employment does not increase: let's think about flops act, which should have led to the recovery of the economy. Not by chance I call it flops act and no jobs act: there is nothing! I would like to remind you that in 2011 the Italian unemployment rate was 2% lower than the average European level, which was much lower than the current one. Today, because of the crisis, the level of unemployment throughout Europe has risen and Italy is no longer below, but is at a level of unemployment of 2% higher than the European average. Italy is also black shirt with regard to employment and it would be easy to talk about youth unemployment. There is therefore a government that does nothing, comes to this House and raises the question of trust. Then he will also have the courage to go to the territories and say: We saved you. Do you think there is anyone from our group here in this House who does not think of the 200,000 households that have deposits in those banks? Is there anyone who doesn't think of the 100,000 businesses on display? I think the figure was about EUR 26 billion. If the bank had failed, what would the companies and the Interbank Fund have done, which must guarantee deposits of up to 100 000 euros, with the situation of the banks we know and with the stock market developments of which we know? We don't hear about these things. Among other things, the measure is very late as the others are. If, in fact, we had intervened earlier, we would have helped many savers, pensioners and families who have invested in actions that have lost 98% of their value or have reset because Europe on 23 June said that there was a financial breakdown of those institutions. Here, however, we pretend nothing and we are told to wait for the white horse of Robin Hood, about which I was talking before, namely the Government, that fixes everything. That's not the way it is. As we are talking about Venetian banks, in Veneto it is said that in this case the patch is worse than the hole. The fact that the provision is mandatory and inescapable, but it is done badly and, moreover, it puts the trust, that we have never felt to give and we do not feel to give even today to this Government, because made of amateurs to the mess, if you want to see it well. If we had intervened earlier, we would not have had to put the current figures. Since numbers are not political, we cannot discuss figures. We can remind you wrong: perhaps for MPS more billions of those remembered before have been put, but it changes little. It's about 8 billion. Here 5 and 1.2 are guaranteed immediately for the staff at the close of the counters and up to 12 billion guarantee. On banking suffering the percentage that is being charged seems to me to be about 50%. Previously, for MPS the load rate was about 20 percent. There is also some clarity to be made about this. You will not get to put that 12 billion, because everything should go wrong, but you could put it much sooner if you had intervened in time. I have not heard a word from the rapporteur on the supervisory bodies. What did the Treasury do until today? Padoan today told us - I repeat - that we must punish hard. But until today, where did he live? This government or, better, this left-wing majority - I don't want to charge Prime Minister Gentiloni Silveri, who inherited everything wrong was also done by the previous government - and the Democratic Party that ruled this country until today where have they been? Wake up today? Did Europe have to tell us on June 23 that there was a breakdown of those banks? Couldn't you think of doing it sooner and better? I am a doctor and I ask myself: have we waited for the metastases around the body of these institutions to pay more and not help the families and businesses that make up the connective tissue of this country, the locomotive in the North-East of our country? Nothing has been done. What is being done today is an intervention that clearly could not penalise the families and businesses of the North-East, the people who have put their resources in the territorial banks of Veneto? I come from Veneto and can tell you that there is a strong identification with the banks of the territory. We wanted to penalise them even more, after pensioners and families saw the value of their shares in those banks zeroed? We also wanted to tell them that we did not even guarantee their deposits if we had something more than 100,000 euros or did we want to tell the Venetian companies to return immediately? I say another thing by the way, because the government has managed to do this, too. The previous government or, indeed, this majority - I do not want to refer to the government - which is the same one that was there before had said that we would pay all the debts of the public administration. They had to be paid already and, instead, not even 40% was made to that social fabric that in Veneto maintains the Italian economy. The small and medium-sized enterprise, which is the backbone of the country's economy, for the most part lies in the so-called rich North-East, which unfortunately is no longer rich today, also because this Government, beyond the international crises that have been and which we recognize, has not launched a single measure in the last five years to help the economy.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5387459397315979, 0.4612540900707245]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, I would ask that the agendas be voted on in conjunction with Rule 15 because, even if it is very acceptable in its content, the wording suffers a little.

The economy will face, as the rapporteur said, the need to sterilize the safeguard clauses and to anticipate the possible increase in rates, following a different policy that the European Central Bank will have to pursue. <p> For these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, the economy continues to grow little. Poverty and the middle class continue to suffer the crisis without real signs of recovery, confidence and well-being; debt continues to grow. Let's put it this way: our country is like a heavy aircraft, a kind of cargo, that in the crisis of the past years has managed to land, limiting the social and economic effects compared to other countries, despite the track was full of holes. The track was full of holes because of the bureaucracy, because of the corruption, because of the inability to produce product and process innovation, because of the lack of capitalization of our companies, because of the political instability of our institutional system. But when we take off, this freighter can't get up. This is the current moment: it seems that rollers a lot on the track at every financial, but then nothing. Looks like you're trying to take off, but then nothing on time. There's no way we're gonna make a flight out of this. <p> This is the long history of the second Republic. There has been a lack of guidance compass to reach the target of 3% of GDP growth, the only real threshold that can produce growth and recovery. Two particular cardinal points are missing in this compass: equality and the United States of Europe. Equality, yes it is, it is still a regulatory value, current and modern. An example of all: the tax wedge. Colleagues, we have finally managed to find a common synthesis in the diagnosis about the validity of this proposal, but we are divided and uncertain about the financial coverage. In addition to the recovery of VAT evasion, a solution has been proposed, which finally found attentive even the reluctant minister Padoan: it is the web tax. Trade and economic transactions have a high tax burden on their shoulders; on the web they move the economy and live the new marketing of products, but the tax burden remains ludicrous. Ladies and gentlemen, the United States of Europe is also an important lead, a cardinal point which we have not yet managed to find room within us and in the same European public debate. As Europe is, it is not good, it is shattered, it is at risk of its end. Going back is worse, dangerous and disastrous; staying like this is just as wrong. The proposal to move towards a two-speed Europe is sterile and inconclusive, like our current economic policy. Only with the United States of Europe can sovereign debts be negotiated and an expansionary policy can be established, in which Italy will be able to free up all its potential, together with other countries with high public debt.

More in detail, paragraph 1 (a) includes, among the crimes against the international personality of the State, two new cases: the crime of financing conduct for purposes of terrorism (Article 270-d.l) and the offence of subtraction of goods or money subject to seizure (Article 270-d.2). The first paragraph of Article 270-d.1, punishes with imprisonment from seven to fifteen years anyone who collects, distributes or makes available goods or money, in any way realized, destined - in whole or in part - to the fulfilment of acts with a terrorist purpose. The criminal case is applied outside the case of association for terrorism purposes already provided for in Article 270- bis of the Criminal Code and the organisation of transfers for terrorism purposes pursuant to Article 270-c.1 and regardless of the actual use of the funds raised. The second paragraph of the new code provision punishes with the penalty of imprisonment from five to ten years anyone who deposits or stores the goods or money intended for the execution of acts with terrorist purposes. Article 270-d.2 sanctions with a prison sentence of two to six years and a fine of 3,000 to 15,000 euros, anyone who subtracts, destroys, disperses, suppresses or deteriorates assets or money seized to prevent the financing of international terrorism. Point (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 4 inserts in the penal code Article 270-f, with which it is made mandatory, in case of conviction or plea for one of the crimes for the purposes of terrorism provided for by the code, the confiscation of the things that served or were destined to commit the crime and of the things that constitute its price, product or profit. If the confiscation of such property is not possible, the provision authorizes the confiscation by equivalent, i.e. the confiscation of other assets of which the deed has availability, for a value corresponding to that price, product or profit. Confiscation may not affect property belonging to third parties outside the crime. Paragraph 1 (c) includes among the crimes against the internal personality of the State the new criminal case of acts of nuclear terrorism (Article 280-b). The provision, in the first paragraph, punishes, by imprisonment from six to twelve years, anyone with a purpose of terrorism procures to himself or to other radioactive matter or creates a nuclear device or otherwise comes into possession of it. The article then punishes with imprisonment not less than fifteen years anyone, for the same purposes, uses radioactive matter or a nuclear device or uses or damages a nuclear plant, in order to release or with the concrete danger that it releases radioactive matter (second paragraph). The third paragraph punishes with the same penalties similar conducts with regard to chemical or biological materials or aggressives. Article 5 amends the letter a) of paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the decree-law anti-terrorism of 2015. This provision stipulates that the personnel of the Internal and External Information and Security Services, like the judicial police, are authorised to conduct as a criminal offence, including in relation to a specific series of crimes for the purpose of terrorism, operating against them the special cause of non-perpetuality referred to in Article 17 of Law No 124 of 3 August 2007. The draft law includes among the offences of terrorism referred to in the provision also the new crime of financing conduct for purposes of terrorism (Article 270-d). Article 6 identifies in the Ministry of Justice the contact point, for the purposes of the 2005 New York Convention, for the suppression of acts of terrorism. The following paragraphs shall contain a series of information obligations in the public prosecutor's office with regard to criminal proceedings for the murder of acts of nuclear terrorism, as referred to in Article 280-b of the Criminal Code. In relation to such proceedings, the prosecutor must inform the Minister of Justice of the prosecution and the execution of a protective custody measure, attaching a copy of the order. In addition, the judicial authority is required to communicate the final outcome of the proceedings, while, in turn, the Minister of Justice must communicate the prosecution, the outcome of the proceedings and the adoption of the precautionary measure to the States Party to the Convention, through the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The location and conservation of seized assets shall also be communicated to the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Article 7 regulates the fate of radioactive materials, nuclear installations or nuclear devices seized in the context of criminal proceedings for acts of nuclear terrorism, providing that the judicial authority should inform the prefect and the Ministry of Justice of the seizure. The prefect, in turn, informed the Minister for the Interior, the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, and the Minister for Health, in addition to the Department of Civil Protection of the Presidency of the Council, must adopt, in the opinion of ISIN, the necessary measures for the safety of radioactive materials. In cases where radioactive materials are to be returned to a State party to the aforementioned New York Convention, the Minister for Economic Development shall provide it in consultation with the Minister for the Interior, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea. Finally, Article 8 introduces into Legislative Decree No 230 of 17 March 1995 implementing a series of Euratom directives on nuclear safety, Article 156- bis, which refers to a decree of the Minister for Economic Development, in agreement with the Minister for the Interior, the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and the Sea, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, after the opinion of ISIN, the identification of a list of radioactive substances and the methods of their management and use, on the basis of the recommendations of the International Energy Agency.

In fact, the \"visas\" and \"considered\" and the presuppositions commit the Government to clarity on a subject relating to the disapplied law of 1993; but to date, after a discussion that has lasted for a long time, even in the previous legislature, there has not been a point of response. This undoubtedly leads to an imbalance between the powers of the Commission and those of Parliament, and then stresses the need to restore a sector which is penalised for the disapplication of a law which has been voted by Parliament and which specifically allocates economic resources. I would like to point out that in the last parliamentary term, for several times, I have joined the Government\\'s request to transform the agendas (I believe that in the last parliamentary term one was also signed by my colleague Vita).

The most worrying recession is the demographic one: the birth block is the real drama of our country. Precisely because the future of our children and of Italy comes before the constraints decided by others, the reduction of taxes will be our final goal. <p> Meanwhile with the growth decree we intervene on the guidelines of action that concern, on the one hand, the strengthening of public and private investments and, on the other, the implementation of incentives and tax reliefs to companies and citizens, including the strengthening of the protection of the made in Italy. Among others, I would like to mention some key measures of the decree-law, such as the re-introduction of the greater depreciation for new capital goods: a facility that allows to increase by 30% the cost of acquisition, for tax purposes, of investments in new capital goods. Then there is the increase in the deductibility of the Imu for companies, which reduces the tax burden on the companies themselves: the deductibility will reach 70% in 2022 and will reach 100% in 2023. A noteworthy intervention is also represented by the definition of mini-Ires. Indeed, in order to facilitate the capitalisation of companies, the benefit-benefit mechanism has been simplified through the application of a reduced rate on non-distributed profits. Unlike the current legislation, which provides for a 9% reduction on specific incremental investments compared to the past, the amendment provides for a simple reduction in the rate on non-distributed profits - within the limits of the increase in equity, excluding banks - linked to the re-utilisation of the same. Equally important is the planned reduction in premiums and contributions for compulsory insurance against accidents at work and occupational diseases, i.e. INAIL contributions, now foreseen for the years 2019 and 2020. With regard to public investment, we act by accelerating the use of resources already allocated to private investments, removing regulatory constraints, remodulating appropriations and encouraging public and private research. The objective of public investment is to boost public expenditure, which has been progressively reduced for more than ten years. For this reason, interventions are planned on the procedures for the realization of the works aimed at using resources already allocated and the allocation to the municipalities of 500 million euros for small investments of rapid execution aimed at the safety of the infrastructures, the buildings and the energy efficiency. Article 7b is very important for small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector because it provides for specific conditions of access to the special section of the Guarantee Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises. The crisis in the construction sector has reduced the rating of banks for these companies, putting them in difficulty for access to credit. One of the most important measures is the bonus earthquake, in order to facilitate anti-seismic interventions even for real estate owned by persons who do not have the liquidity necessary to anticipate such expenses, it is extended to areas 2 and 3 of seismic risk, while today it is only planned for the buildings of zone 1. This benefit allows the tax deduction of 75 percent in case of improvement of an energy classification class and 85 percent of the purchase price of the property unit in case of passage of two classes. The growth decree favours a series of tax reliefs and incentives and to revive private investments, provides rules for the protection of the made in Italy and other measures for the support of the growth. These are all measures that have always been hoped for by this majority and which are finally being implemented today. The decree-law represents for us an opportunity for growth and recovery of the economy. Before concluding, President, in terms of growth I would like to remind you of the beautiful victory of the award of the Olympics 2026 in Milan-Cortina. <p> It is the result of the great work done by those who have always believed in this goal. The regional administrations of Veneto and Lombardy, led by Zaia and Fontana, received the right recognition of the great work done and for having believed in it to the end. Compliments go also to the two mayors of the cities Ghedina and Sala for having shared efforts and enthusiasm, but fundamental was the contribution of Giancarlo Giorgetti in having managed to involve the Government in this wonderful adventure, which allowed to shout to victory all Italy, which from this event can find the inspiration and enthusiasm to start the whole country again. <p> I can only express all my joy at the great opportunity that this event can give our country. The international sporting events are a possibility of development and growth for the country if thought and planned as opportunities for construction and upgrading of infrastructure that can be used and requalified for everyday civil use. This was precisely the extra march that made possible the victory of our country. It is therefore not only an event that once again brings prestige and prestige to Italy, but also a possibility of developing a sustainable plan that will increase employment and consumption, not only until the event is realized, leaving good fruits usable and tangible to all citizens. <p> Finally, I would like to stress the attention the League has to citizens and businesses. The measure is proof of this because it will allow us to achieve the objective of meeting the needs of Italians and our companies, in the hope that we can recreate a relationship of trust between the State and the citizens. <p> .

It must be taken into account, mea culpa and proceed with actions necessary to change the state of affairs, as citizens and businesses demand. I am part of a parliamentary group - Forza Italia - that has never refrained from pointing out certain system bugs and has always worked to provide concrete solutions, now more than ever with our Ministers and Undersecretaries, who are doing a great job. This is the case with what Minister Brunetta has done since the first day of his work to try to make the operation of the public administration efficient. The decree-law under consideration today is the result of his work, in agreement with the other Dicasteries, to which I extend my gratitude through the Undersecretary Bergamini, present in this Chamber. I believe that the secret to the proper functioning of this experience of government is kept in a sentence pronounced by President Draghi: \"Every waste today is a wrong that we do to the next generations.\" In these words of the Premier there is no need for slogans, nor for slogans; in those words the dreams of young women and young men, of our entrepreneurs and workers are guarded. In this sense, the National Recovery and Resilience Plan is a single flywheel to be exploited to the full and no mistakes are allowed. Last March, during the Southern states-general, I had the opportunity to confront the players involved in the mobility system, who expressed the concerns common to all. Unanimous was the demand for simplification of procedures and legislative ageing, because with the procedures in force today infrastructure works with a cost exceeding 100 million euros have an average time of realization of about sixteen years. Without the work of this Executive, the risk would have been to spend only 48% of the resources of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. I provide some numbers so that I can be clearer. The bureaucracy costs Italian companies 57 billion euros a year and this is a real limit to the full expression of our economic potential. Because of too much bureaucracy, which results in inefficiencies and poor quality, Italy loses €70 billion of GDP every year. It is therefore clear that action to limit this waste is now more essential than ever, in the light of the economic effort that will be required of future generations. The decree-law under consideration, making possible the advance of 25 billion euros of the incoming European funds, is the guarantee that Italy will have to proceed at speed, without prejudice to the legitimate protections for the enterprises. The change of pace is evident: halved the time of environmental assessments, simplified the authorization procedures that also concern the production of energy from renewable sources and reduced the expectations for permits for the ultra-wide band. The procurements and the realizations of important strategic works for the entire country are accelerated, simplifying, among other things, the procedures for the works of important impact (I think, for example, the high speed on the Salerno-Reggio Calabria route). Finally, the government has kept its promise to unlock the 110% superbonus, which is an important incentive for energy efficiency and earthquake-proof interventions on buildings. With regard to anti-seismic interventions, particularly regarding public buildings, I would like to make a request to the Commission. A few months ago, the four-year period of funding for the anti-seismic adaptation of school buildings was concluded, and several administrations have fallen from funding due to the obvious delays in bureaucratic procedures also caused by the emerging situation. I therefore ask the representatives of the Government present here to make an effort to overcome this bureaucratic difficulty and to allow the money allocated to be used up to the last cent. By doing so, we will allow our children, starting next academic year, to study in safer places. Of course, this is an important first step towards the complex simplification of the bureaucratic machinery that we have been waiting for too long. To this - I am sure - will follow other concrete and incisive measures in order to restart our country in a roadway without deviations or reversals of march.

I do not think it is necessary to dwell on the reasons behind this vast will, so much is universally known to the whole world Gioachino Rossini, as well as his contribution to the music and culture of our country and the whole world. <p> I just have a few things to say, referring to the more organizational aspects of reading the report linked to the bill. <p> Gioachino Rossini was certainly an excellent figure of the cultural and artistic creativity of Italy; one of the greatest exponents of our opera tradition, still envied in the world today, and factor of Italian attractiveness, along with many other components. Rossini was an original musician, unpredictable, in some respects elusive; a mix of wit and depth, good mood and heroic splashes. He was able to interpret as a few times and a country. He played the first nineteenth century and its changes. After the classicist era, after Haydn\\'s epic, Mozart and Beethoven, there was a question of new emotions, new sensibilities; a request to represent different, new ideas and characters, and Rossini did so, as part of a movement that then led to the full deployment of musical Romanticism in Germany and throughout Europe. He then interpreted the talents of Italy, Italians and their character: fantasy, joy, satire, the desire to sing, and also good feelings, ideals, great passions on great themes. From \"Il barbiere di Seville\" to \"Guglielmo Tell\" to \"La Cenerentola\" to \"Otello\" to \"L\\'italiana in Algiers\" to \"Tancredi\" you have never forgotten its great sacred achievements. I am thinking of the two absolute summits: \"Stabat Mater\" and \"Petite masse solemnelle\": works of maturity and old age. In conclusion, the celebrations will certainly be useful in retracing the extraordinary creative parable of Rossini, but hopefully also to other. I think essentially of an accompaniment, important and positive for the activity of Rossini opera festival of Pesaro, to which goes our applause for having become now one of the most important annual cultural events of our country; and this to try to recover and enhance the documents, archives, places Rossini that still represent the split of a significant period in the life of our territory, and more generally to stimulate a new attention for the Italian opera in all its forms: the comedy, semi-serious, serious, heroic, tragic. Rossini has visited and practiced them all and for this reason he is one of the great in the pantheon of Italian and world music and culture. I would like to conclude with the hope that, alongside the Rossini celebrations, this year, together with the other achievements made in the field of culture, we can put in the carnier other significant achievements, among which I would like to mention the reorganization of the world of conservatives and musical formation, so much awaited today in our country.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5303090810775757, 0.4696909785270691]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> D'ANNA (<PARTY>).

We must therefore remember the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs Gaetano Martino, who promoted and presided over the Messina Conference, and that of the President of the Council Antonio Segni, as well as high-level diplomats, including in particular Roberto Ducci, who was President of the Committee for the drafting of the Treaties of Rome under the leadership of the Belgian Prime Minister Spaak. It was an example that we must remember, but above all it was a story of successive advances and achievements that it is very important that the President-in-Office of the Council wanted to make so much use of. It would be time to rediscover a European pride that we have lost and Italian pride for the contribution we have made to European integration. <p> President Mario Draghi has all referred to this in a beautiful speech such as that given in Ljubljana, in which he has unmistakably demonstrated what progress Europe has been able to make through integration and how we would be much poorer and more isolated if we had not taken that path. <p> As for what the Declaration can tell us, I would like first of all - and I think it is possible - Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Declaration for the 60th anniversary echoes the dramatic words that were spoken in Versailles the day before yesterday and that are a new fact. We have heard President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel (the Italian positions were already on that line) say dramatically that Europe cannot stand still unless it risks seeing what it has built collapse, that Europe must advance along the path of integration, if necessary even at different speeds. I believe that this would already be important and challenging, and I think that this can be achieved, because at a certain moment, for the sake of realism, we have noted that in the 2017 election year it would have been useless to expect decisions of extraordinary scope, but we have even feared that this year was marked, as well as by the inaction, by the silence of the Union. This wasn't and I don't think it should be when you gather here in Rome to celebrate your 60th anniversary. <p> The words of Chancellor Merkel first in Malta, and then his and those of the other three Heads of State and Government gathered in Versailles can also be considered an understandable and legitimate reaction to a long exercise of discomfort and patience that has accompanied us in recent months. Because Brexit has been answered by the 27 remaining members of the European Union with an appeal to unity, to remain united, but without taking a single step forward: this was the price that has been paid and that is rightly said today with conviction (it is not words that can expire twenty-four or forty-eight hours after the Versailles meeting) that we cannot stand still and that we must move in a precise direction: that of the further and more coherent development of the integration process. <p> Of course, we know that not all 27 share the goal, targets and modes or the speed of advance on that ground. There is also something more we need to be aware of. Last night on the news I heard and saw - and I don't think I was the only one - words and images that deeply impressed me: the words of xenophobic alarmism of the Hungarian Prime Minister, the images of barriers, barbed wire and a special body of anti-immigrant guards that characterize that Government's response to the great phenomenon of migration and the pressure of asylum seekers who invoke a universally recognized right. I would say that it is very difficult to understand at what speed and in what direction it is possible to move with these positions which deny the constituent values of European integration. <p> The roadmaps and even a roadmap for the development of the integration process are contained in a document dated 22 June 2015, that of the five Presidents, which also starts from the need for an economic union aimed at growth, employment and social protection policies. But soon the first stage of that road map will come to an end and nothing has moved: I wonder if they have weighed negatively more the timidities of the countries that believe us or the reluctances and obstructive challenges of the countries that do not share those directions. <p> We can move forward in the direction of different speeds; it is already very important that concrete progress is made on defence policies. Here we remain also in the field of a vision of the Treaty, which is that of enhanced cooperation or, indeed, in this case, of cooperation which is defined in the Treaty of Lisbon which is structured. We can move forward in that direction and begin to resolve all the other questions which concern first, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the exercise of the necessary decisions as a European Council, taking advantage of all the possibilities of majority voting, which are not subject to unanimity or mere informal absences, which make those decisions dead letter. There are many questions to be resolved in order to move forward on the road that has already been drawn up and, in particular, on the road to a common immigration and asylum policy.

We cannot and do not want to get used to this. In Sassari a woman, Anna Doppiu, sixty-four years old, was savagely beaten by her husband, who then burned her still alive. She had not felt the need to denounce her husband, from whom she suffered violence and from whom she had, moreover, decided to separate herself. On November 12, in Poggibonsi, in the province of Siena, another woman, Ionela Sandu was murdered in a barbaric way by her partner, by the man with whom she had a sentimental relationship, after a quarrel. She was hit by a truck driven by the man with whom she was having this affair. The man is now under arrest on the charge of voluntary murder. This brings to 26 the women we have remembered in this relay, which began only on 30 June. There are many people who in Sassari, last Saturday, participated in a flash mob in which were remembered, in addition to Anna, the 98 women victims of feminicide in 2016, as well as many people who in Siena, in these days, participated in the torchlight in memory of Ionela. ISTAT informs us that in Italy a woman is killed every 2.2 days. 46.3 percent of the women killed die at the hands of his companion. The dramatic bulletin is even more serious because physical and sexual violence has increased further and cases of assisted violence are also growing. As the cases of Anna and Ionela also show, feminicide is almost always the ultimate result of a series of long-standing violent behaviors. It is not only a matter of attention and awareness that we are facing a problem that needs to be tackled decisively, but also of giving protection, support, answers and concrete aid to all women who live in situations of potential danger. It is necessary to act with severity and constant monitoring of all situations at risk, so as not to allow them to disappear. Women and men together can stop this carnage. They can do this by demanding the strict application of regulations, but also by having the strength to trigger that change of pace, first of all cultural, that allows to support and make live gender equality everywhere, in every sector, to promote the education of children, in the school and family, to respect the body of women, together with the fact that daughters and young women must find the strength to have more respect for themselves and for their body, denouncing violence from the first almost imperceptible moves, without ever justifying it. The company and the institutions must be able to respond immediately to the slightest request for aid and assistance. We need an authentically equal democracy that asserts rights, to break down a culture that is still patriarchal, to prevent, to defeat sexual stereotypes and prejudices, to ensure freedom and autonomy of choice in the life path of women. Let us make our appeal with conviction. An appeal to the Minister for Equal Opportunities and to the Government everything: the directing booth constantly verify the application, the merits and the limits of Law No 119 of 2013 and, above all, give full and accurate implementation of the plan against violence. An appeal to the media: stop justifying murderers and blaming women. An appeal to the country, men and women: 160 women killed every year, we can no longer, all together, accept this massacre.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.8068959712982178, 0.19310399889945984]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, Senators and Senators, the bill we are debating today bears my signature, among other things, because this was my first act in this legislature, since on 15 March 2013 I presented a draft law, signed by Senators Tronti and Corsini, on this subject. <p> That is to say how much I care about this issue and to arrive at an important clarification. I intend to vote in favour of this bill, while expressing a strong perplexity and a radical dissatisfaction with the article. I explain the reasons for my position, which is not limited to some critical issues, albeit relevant, but concerns the establishment and overall inspiration of the bill. <p> In my opinion, it contains wordings which seriously weaken the meaning, the perspective and the purpose of this legislation, starting with the wording which provides for the recurrence of acts of violence, that is, the fact that they must be repeated for torture to occur. That sounds like a big mistake. <p> Moreover, among the penalties envisaged, life imprisonment is introduced in the most relevant case. And so, while in many other situations and in relation to many other measures, many of us work to overcome the \"end of sentence never\" here comes life sentence with respect to a new case. <p> And yet the fundamental reason for criticism is another. This is about the fact that in the measure under consideration torture is not classified as a crime of its own, but as a common offence. <p> I am starting from an article in our Constitution which is neglected, although it is - in my opinion - the basis of the speech that today, around the provision in title, is necessary to make. I refer to the fourth paragraph of Article 13, where it is established that any physical and moral violence against persons who are subject to freedom restrictions is punished. According to some constitutionalists, this is the only place in our Constitutional Charter where the introduction of a crime is expressly and openly provided for, which becomes legally and constitutionally mandatory. <p> Attention, the decisive passage of that paragraph is the formula: \"restrictions of freedom\". In fact, this explicitly refers to a condition where the State is deprived of freedom through its apparatuses, its organisms and its men. <p> This refers to another equally important wording, contained in the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, where, in fact, the offence of torture is classified as an offence of its own, namely that of public officials, officials of the State and those of any public authority. <p> This is the essential issue that is being totally eluded in the draft law currently under discussion, because the crime of torture is envisaged as a common crime, attributable to any citizen. <p> And this raises a question, not only fundamental, but even directly, because precisely in the 1984 UN Convention - against which our country is facing a scandalous delay of thirty years - the specificity of the torture offence is identified and firmly linked to participation, acts of violence, against those who are subject to restrictions of freedom, of those who are in charge of the public service. Above all, this is an essential element of the reasoning behind the bill signed by me and Senators Tronti and Corsini: I am referring to the fact that precisely that essential foundation of the rule of law, which provides for the ownership of the legitimate monopoly of force in the police bodies, is a very delicate issue. A function so essential that it requires maximum balance and intelligence in its exercise. <p> Therefore, it is not only possibility, but the duty of the State to publicly delegitimize those who abuse that legitimate monopoly of force. In fact, this is the knot. Torture finds its root exactly in this category, that is, in that of the abuse of power, the arbitrary and illegal exercise of a legitimate force, used extra legem. If we remove this circumstance from the scope of this reasoning and from the concrete scope of this structure, the measure in question is fatally devitalized. I would add that we have entered the heart of a crucial issue. I would like to draw attention to this because we are talking about the fundamental principles of the rule of law and of the democratic state because the safety of the person and his body while they are in the custody of the State, his apparatus and his men, the physical and psychic integrity of that person and his body, regardless of the biography and his curriculum (also a criminal curriculum), founded the social pact and founded the political obligation and the same legal and moral legitimacy of the democratic state. This is the essence of the obligation between the citizen and the democratic state: the certainty that the State guarantees safety, physical and psychic integrity, all the more so when in its custody, gives strength to the covenant of obedience to the State, and to the duty of loyalty to it. It is on this pact, between a guarantee of safety for the citizen, and loyalty to the State that is based on the order of the democratic state. Therefore, the violation of the foundations of this political pact between citizen and state constitutes the most serious crime and not only for humanitarianism: because every human life is unique and unrepeatable, but precisely for the legal and political reasons I have set out. Finally, I think that the honour of the police bodies, the dignity of the uniform, the integrity of their image descend exactly from the capacity of the State to sanction, on the basis of the principle of criminal responsibility as always personal responsibility, those who violate that pact between the citizen and the State and thus turn out to be unfaithful servants. Therefore, to defend that dignity and that honour is the capacity of the State, its laws and the same members of the Forces of the Order to recognize that the injury of the body of the citizen entrusted to their custody is indeed the most serious crime. And precisely because when the body of the citizen is in the hands of the State that body is the greatest and most precious good on which, precisely, the legitimacy of the State itself is founded. It is the State with its laws, with the institution of the crime of torture, that defends that dignity. It is the State, with its law on the crime of torture, that can better defend that dignity. Certainly not those hoodlums who protect the shame of those who have committed the crimes and murders for which they have been convicted, coming to offend the family members of the victims. <p> That is why, considering that we are having an important debate, thirty years after the UN Convention on Torture, my vote will still be in favour of this bill, which, however, leaves me dissatisfied on many points.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5446723103523254, 0.45532771944999695]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, representative of the Government, colleagues and colleagues, the subject of today's debate is very important and vital for so many families and companies in our country. The uncontrolled increase in energy costs risks having a devastating impact on budgets, especially of the weakest sections of the population, directly and indirectly. Directly, because with the winter season at the door the consumption for light and heating is destined to grow; indirectly, because the increase of the energy costs for the companies, cascade, will provoke an increase of the prices of the finished products, with the result to impact further in a negative way on the family budgets, even only at the level of the costs to be incurred in order to make the expense, considered the combined increase and so far uncontrolled of the costs to the fuel pump. It is enough to see, already compared to a year ago, how much the retail prices of many products have increased. <p> The situation worsened after the cost of electricity increased sharply from the second quarter of 2020 to August of this year, from 16,08 to 22,89 euro cents per kilowatt hour, according to the prices of the most protected service. In the meantime, however, prices have materially increased considerably. Suffice it to say that the price of oil has increased by 200 percent since spring 2020 and that of natural gas by 30 percent only in the last three months. This last aspect is particularly important for the situation of our country, since natural gas is used to produce 40% of electricity. <p> This situation has been caused by a combination of factors, including the reduced availability of gas produced directly in Europe and the decrease in supplies from Russia, from which Europe is heavily dependent on energy. <p> Without wishing to go into geopolitical considerations, it is clear that Italy's position is very weak, given the known energy dependence on foreign supplies to cover domestic needs. This is a condition which, in cases like this, of reckless price increases because of undoubted speculation, accentuates the fragility of our economy. <p> In this sense, the hasty abandonment of energy production through nuclear power plants is proving to be detrimental to our country from an economic point of view. <p> The issue of renewable energy is always used ideologically without concrete data, but the truth is that about 10% of electricity consumption in Italy comes from nuclear power and is all imported, mainly from neighbouring France, which also produces about 75% of its electricity with nuclear power plants. We have renounced the production of nuclear energy for environmental reasons, but we buy it from the other side, with the result that we pay for something that we could have produced at home, without being protected from the alleged risks associated with its production. <p> If there is a lesson to be used for the crisis in which we are debating, this is the fact that we must work to reduce our dependence on energy imports as much as possible. <p> If this has to go from the re-introduction of nuclear production by exploiting new technologies with high safety and low environmental impact, then it is good to address the issue, without bowing to the instrumental propaganda of the fanatics of environmentalism that, as some have said, cause more damage than the climatic catastrophe they are debating. <p> The government, with the measure we are discussing today, has put in place extraordinary measures to mitigate the effects of the surge in gas and light prices, committing a lot of resources overall. These are impressive figures, but not nearly enough to cover the increase in energy prices that we buy from abroad. In fact, with the heavy economic effort studied by the government the expected increases in bills will be 29.08 percent for light and 14.04 for gas, impacting in any case heavy on the budgets of many families, but not only. We think, in fact, of the increase in the costs of other raw materials such as steel and, combining them with the increases in the cost of energy, the result will be exorbitant increases for the final products. <p> If the cost of producing a car increases in line with that of its components, especially plastic and steel parts, the same will be done in proportion with the price to the consumer, with the result of decreasing the share of potential buyers. A reduction in car sales translates into less production and less work primarily for the workers of the assembly factories and later for the components companies, in a vicious circle that could have dramatic effects on the economy of our country. The example of the automotive sector could also be replicated in other sectors. The nightmare of a new bad season is not so distant and obviously not only concerns our country, but the whole of Europe with the due proportions. At this moment our companies - I am talking in particular about my area, the Canavese, where 70% of the steel is printed in Italy - are experiencing a recovery phase, after a stagnation due to the explosion of the pandemic. This phase, however, is likely to end very soon if the spiral of rising commodity prices is not slowed down. In this sense, the European Union is called upon to play an extraordinarily important role in avoiding, or at least mitigating, the effects of an economic crisis which is not yet well defined in all its seriousness. It is clear that Italy cannot continue indefinitely to provide resources to reduce energy costs, it needs a structural response to meet the challenges facing us in the current situation and to plan a strategy to protect us from dependence and imports of energy resources. These answers can only come from Europe, where we believe that our country will be able to recite a first-class role thanks also to the authority, competence and experience of our President-in-Office of the Council. With regard to the measures of the day to contain increases in energy bills, we at the League are certainly in favour, although we are aware that this is a palliative that cannot solve the problem alone.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6721147894859314, 0.3278851807117462]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> NASTERS (<PARTY>). Mr President, according to UN estimates, every year plastic waste at sea is around 8 million tonnes. Of course, waste is only the tip of the iceberg. The sea is literally invaded by plastics, which then go to degrade and damage fish fauna. The objective of this bill, which we have talked a lot about in the Commissions, for almost two years now, is to contribute to the recovery of the ecosystem and to the promotion of the circular economy and, clearly, to the recovery of accidentally caught waste, as has been said before, for the cleaning of the sea. Finally, one of the important aspects is the awareness-raising of the community with the dissemination of behavioural models aimed at preventing the phenomenon of waste abandonment. Let us not forget that Italy is two thirds wet from the sea, so who better than us should have at heart the emergency of marine waste? Brothers of Italy like it very much when the projects are ambitious. They fascinate us much less when these projects, which in theory could be ambitious, do not make the most of their potential. This has certainly been a handicap of the bill to our examination, so to define it today saves the sea is a discreet exercise of political communication. Certainly, however, it does not represent reality and, above all, the truth. We could call this, as I have often said in the Commission, a \"clean sea.\" We, precisely because we were aware of the importance of this measure, had tabled several amendments. To speed up the process, some of the amendments had been withdrawn. Brothers of Italy had tabled this amendment precisely to improve all the contradictions - and there are - within the bill. By the way, I would like to mention one important point, given the presence of Mr Undersecretary as well. In the budget law, the application of plastic tax was postponed to 2023. It should be understood, in the meantime, what is the government\\'s orientation: plastic yes or plastic no? We must not always reason in a punitive logic through taxation, because this certainly does not help. I would also like to say to my colleagues that the legislation in place creates a great paradox, namely that fishermen have to pay for the disposal of waste at sea. We, on the other hand, had prepared an amendment in the Commission, together with my colleague Mr Iannone, to establish an incentive, especially for fish farmers, to facilitate the recovery of waste at sea. We had proposed the figure of 40 euros for every quintal of waste: money recovered, but we were not heard. This is because, when serious solutions are proposed, they are clearly rejected. Instead of strengthening controls on those who discharge illegally at sea, as always, put costs on general taxation. An alternative system had to be found to cover the costs of managing waste recovered at sea. Why should cleanliness of the sea not fall within the strategic objective of the PNRR? In any case, it is said that it is necessary to raise awareness and that it is necessary to educate. What is said in this bill is that we must inform users and also the population. Let\\'s do it, then, but seriously. If we really want to defend the issue of the environment, we must also be a little brave and, above all, forward-looking presidents in legislative measures. We hoped that this would be an opportunity to solve the problems of waste, for example those abandoned on the beaches or on the coasts, which are then sucked into the sea, but that was not the case. There is systematic talk of finding synergy and also a union with the productive world for the relaunch of environmental issues. We were deluded that it was the good time, but it didn\\'t. For all these reasons, our vote will be a vote of abstention, because there has been a lack of foresight, but above all a strategy to be able to actually help, with this bill, so many people who needed it.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5871294736862183, 0.41287049651145935]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, representatives of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, this measure once again confirms the inability, now established, of a Government that does not know how to deal with such a serious and real problem with solutions that are not merely absurd and even harmful. Solutions that all do inside them except be such. This means dealing with a problem without solving it. You know this and the government knows it: with palliatives and a bill that bears a name that probably masks and hides what can be simply an indult and a false solution to the problem of prisons, nothing is solved, rather it creates a damage to our country. <p> Overcrowding is not in fact faced by emptying the prisons and freeing prisoners with convictions for serious crimes, but it is contrasted with interventions that go in the sense of prevention, first of all. The only method to prevent, according to the North League, is the certainty of the penalty; the seriousness of the certainty of the penalty is fundamental. We are therefore absolutely opposed to this measure and will put in place all the initiatives to counter it and stop an unholy choice. The text had already been blocked in the Senate in the previous legislature, because the criticalities were and are still evident. Several things in this text did not go then and even less go today. <p> We enter into the issues that the North League considers essential, namely security and, as already mentioned, certainty of punishment. We are talking about crimes of particular social alarm, but called minor crimes. If we can define minor crimes as those involving penalties of up to five years, then they will be decriminalised. If we can define minor crimes as theft, scam, concealment, stalking, violence, even child pornography and - I shall talk about it later - illegal immigration. I want to stress this by sharing the thoughts of the whole Group: these are crimes that involve social alarm at an already difficult time because of a heavy economic reality that is now unsustainable. Our people do not have a job and do not arrive at the end of the month, the economy does not start again, the companies close, the entrepreneurs are forced to make drastic choices. Let\\'s think about Veneto, where suicides are unfortunately a heavy but daily fact, because many do not make it anymore. What are we talking about? The problem at the moment is not the economy, but the empty-carriage measure. Definitely that of the prisons is a problem and a social emergency, but not the primary emergency that the country is currently facing, which instead is outside the doors and waiting for concrete answers. So, as I was saying, this is a wrong and rewarding measure, but to the sole benefit of those who commit crimes. We must stop with the goodness that justifies everything and everyone, by blaming society, which creates these poor people, these poor people! - who have no other way of surviving than to commit crimes. This is an absurd and offensive excuse for those who live and work with honesty, respecting the rules and others, for people who choose to live honestly, despite a thousand difficulties, without seeking excuses to live in lawlessness. But what message do we want to give with this provision? We want to tell the world that Italy is a country where everything can be done, so that we can say: I go to Italy, so I can steal and I don\\'t risk anything, at the limit of a few days at home, maybe even at hours or, I don\\'t know, on shifts. This is the message that is coming out: we will have a circulation of criminals, days or hours apart. You could also provide an incentive for work, a new regulation, such as a vertical or horizontal part-time at will of the recluse, identifying the days or hours of detention at your home. Or we may also decide to make a list of preferred locations. Are you kidding me? What message do we give this country? <p> We have seen how the Law on Indult, No. 241 of 2006, which the North League has opposed and on which, of course, it has not voted in favour, has failed, since 85% of the beneficiaries have returned to crime. We can say that the North League has always opposed populism and goodness, expressed for a vote, for an exchange of preferences or choices and not according to the logic of the defence of the citizens. <p> Let us therefore consider the further negative effects of this measure. Where does the educational function of punishment go if we want to talk about the education and integration of these people? We educate them by giving them freedom of action, the freedom to take away freedom from honest citizens, who in this country, fortunately, are still many. And we come to the madness of abolishing the crime of illegal immigration, as proposed by the 5 Star Movement. I am sorry, but this can only be called madness: open doors and the right to embark for Italy, with consequences not only economic for the country, but also without any respect for those people who, given false hopes, will arrive in Italy, with the ways we have seen in recent years, trying to make sure that it does not happen again. They will arrive with the boats, which will go deeper, and immigrants, with their dream of reaching a country that will give them nothing, will die in the middle of the sea. This is what you will do: this is the future you will give to these people. <p> I believe that you are really wrong, in the face of respect for the citizens, who certainly did not vote for you to have a less secure country, in which honest people, who have always worked there, find themselves at the bottom of the list of priorities. I repeat: people are already experiencing a moment of social crisis, conflicts and economic difficulties. Our role is to give security, not to exasperate discomfort, not to counter these situations. Our task is to give work and therefore not only relief to hire prisoners, but relief to hire first the citizens who have always worked honestly in this country. <p> Let us return to the problem of the overcrowding of prisons: 40% of the prisoners are non-EU citizens and in some parts of the North we reach a percentage of 60% or 70%. Should we therefore take charge of this? Can we take charge of this right now? Can we suffer crimes and also suffer the obligation to serve the sentence in the country in which they were committed, taking away resources from honest citizens, families and entrepreneurs? Can we not, then, talk about hypocrisy in acting? Instead, we must take concrete action, create new work, bring our country and our citizens back to life, so that we can eventually accept immigrants who enter our country honestly and regularly. No one has ever wanted to wage war on immigrants just because they are outside the EU, but in this case we are talking about illegal immigrants: this is a very different concept. <p> There is a crime that arises precisely from this situation and from the impossibility of giving them work and the future. Let\\'s stop talking about \"A\" and \"B\" crime. Crime is just crime and as such must be fought and our citizens must be defended. Bilateral return agreements are needed. These people have to serve their time in their country where, unlike Italy, dear gentlemen, the penalty is certain and prisons - pass me the joke - are certainly not five-star hotels. <p> And then the law enforcement? Who works there? What respect instead for these workers? What guarantees for those who, every day, fight crime and put at risk, at risk their lives, I say not without economic incentives, but even under paid and under organic, and discouraged by measures that like this will surely reduce their desire to fight and keep the country still honest and livable. I think it is incorrect, even with regard to those who fight crime every day, to accept this plan and, in particular, the annulment of the crime of hiding. We can\\'t discourage their actions. <p> Finally, let us think of the courts that, with the reform of judicial geography, are even closed, even the efficient ones. But perhaps someone should understand that the times of justice are inadmissible in this country and that it is necessary to make them work and not close. The efficient ones must be allowed to remain active and - I repeat - those who do not work, optimizing their work. Do we have to solve these problems and how do we do that? By closing them. <p> This is the work of the current Government: it dissolves a system and, instead of making incisive choices for a recovery, it continues to act completely contrary. As someone said yesterday, you seem to govern how shrimp move. <p> Gentlemen, justice has biblical and shameful times, times that fill prisons with inmates still awaiting judgment. That\\'s the truth. We\\'re going back every day more. Let us say enough of this populist demagogy, of this lack of and evident respect for your citizens, for the honest ones, my lords. Is it possible that the unique vision goes only in the sense of respect for the criminals who illegally enter our country? But what message do we give to our children, to our people? What future do we give them? And we wonder why they leave this country: not only because they lack work, gentlemen, but because it doesn\\'t give them anything anymore, it doesn\\'t give certainty and security. <p> He won\\'t let us stay there anymore. Our young people leave because there are many causes, and not just because there is no job. Believe me. <p> After this crazy measure the country will certainly have even less security, less possibility in the future, less work and less desire to stay. We keep illegals at the expense of honest immigrants. Let us remember that we also have an honest immigration, which has integrated into our country and - believe me - that it is itself contrary to the current situation that still causes problems to their families. There are immigrants in the country who want to have a future, to grow, to work, to integrate and to respect the rules. These people are also present, of course, and our country has never denied them anything, indeed it has allowed them to build the future that they so longed for and hoped to find in our territory. <p> We defend our people, the people who must now be locked in the house, who must defend themselves and who must defend their efforts - the elderly and the children - from those who have no respect for anything and no one, from those who have a culture quite different from ours. <p> I repeat, this is a government that works backwards. <p> Then we stop talking about the history of our country, a history of emigration and poverty. I come from Veneto and in particular from Belluno, a land of immigrants, gentlemen, who I think every day offend them in relation to these immigrants. Our migrants without a contract did not leave, otherwise the border was not crossed. They were checked and visited - there was still a health check in other countries - and sometimes even humiliated. They did not leave and do not arrive with the arrogance that today, unfortunately, immigrants have in demanding only rights and no duty in this country. <p> So let\\'s stop offending our emigrants who, abroad, have brought their value, their ability, the concreteness of wanting to do, to grow and give lustre to our country. However, they brought skills and distinguished themselves in various fields. And they have demonstrated it all over the world, among other things, our Italians who - I repeat - have been able to bring not only skills, but also remittances, capital and economy. <p> Now you, on the contrary, open the doors by deceiving these desperate to the sound of billions of euros, perhaps the last ones, but still billions of euros. We know what these journeys cost, among other things, to a practically non-existent future, to those who embark on this country, whom I would call hypocritical at this point: a country that has no respect for citizens, especially the weakest. But who should protect them but a government? Who has to give that security to the elderly, who after a working life are afraid of being mugged, maybe the only pension that allows them to sustain themselves, to live, when it\\'s okay? Or as it always happens (occasions that have happened recently also in my areas), they are beaten to death, and beaten by whom? In the last episode, my lords, the leaders were in any case non-EU, which these people had welcomed and helped because they also migrants in their youth; people who had given these immigrants confidence, so much to open the doors to them and to be filled with beatings and robbed. <p> This also happens, my lords, because our country is still ‐ as was said before ‐ open and available. But unfortunately, these things also happen. The trust that we give these people living in poverty is not always paid back, indeed, unfortunately - we see it every day - things go wrong. So we live in fear. <p> I truly believe that it is time for this Government to assess how the measure could represent, if approved, a further shame of this country. <p> We think, then, of cultures, of diversity of culture. We women, indeed you women (at this point my group and I call ourselves out, having a very different concreteness) have come here to speak, you have washed your mouth, you have spoken of the Treaty of Istanbul, you have demagogically carried out problems concerning violence against women; but do you have any idea how different we are culturally, the abyss that exists in the way of conceiving the family, the woman, the daughters in our culture compared to those to which we want to open the doors? I think the episodes you see every day can prove it. <p> There are cases in which daughters, born in Italy, if they do not enter our culture, in a culture however free, are killed, my lords, suppressed. Perhaps you should read some books about situations that have occurred over the years to Italian women who have gone to live in these countries; perhaps they would open your eyes to understand the brutality and violence that is being used towards the woman herself. We cannot do goodness and lose, we, our dignity and our strength, to leave room for these violence, which are unheard of. <p> We need a serious economic and social policy, rigid, with laws that see the answer in concrete and serious penalties. Give our people security, give them a home. Perhaps someone has already said this before: there has been a demonstration in Rome for the right to the house. But let\\'s look at the rankings, my lords, let\\'s look at who takes the housing, who has the housing of the municipalities, who receives support. They are not our citizens, who perhaps for a lifetime have worked and are with a minimum pension, certainly not with a golden pension (which, by the way, someone has still supported here). <p> They can\\'t even pay for their daily lives, and the last week they don\\'t even see the meat on the table. But the houses we give to the non-EU countries, those of course that have not so far produced any kind of income or security of the country. <p> Let us remember: first our people, gentlemen, who have the fundamental right to have an answer for what they have given to their country, working honestly. <p> We are therefore convinced that we cannot accept this bill at all, that we cannot take the future away from our children and our people. This measure today denies this future. <p> It is a measure that will really bring a change, an openness, in which Italy will be seen as the country of the \"Let\\'s all go, so nothing happens; let\\'s do what we want, no one will tell us anything; we can also occupy the country, indeed, why not? However, we will not have any kind of penalty, only discounts and only rights.

Gentlemen, perhaps this is the most serious thing about this bill that you find you have to vote on and, in any case, have to justify to your citizens too. <p> Today in this country you have legalized the invasion of those who will know that they are being protected, unlike our honest citizens. That is the truth, my lords, and when we talk about the security package that Maroni launched in 2009, well who said that our Minister Castelli absolutely did not act in the correctness of the result, I think that perhaps we should reread the data, verify it and understand its consistency. <p> However, by announcing what will be the final explanation of vote, which will be carried out by my colleague, we in the League are completely opposed to this measure and we want to reiterate that we will not be complicit in this shame.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5582025051116943, 0.44179749488830566]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> THE <PARTY>ETRA (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Senators, members of the Government, I have already had the opportunity to express our thoughts in general discussion, so I will try not to repeat concepts already set out. Our attitude was, above all, a stimulus to the measure. We have tried to make a positive contribution, even in the awareness of the real impossibility to modify the text of the decree-law that emerged from the discussion that took place in the House. Nevertheless, we have tabled a number of specific amendments in this spirit. I am thinking of the amendments to Article 2, which provide for a contribution to cover the costs incurred for interest on bank loans contracted by companies by 31 December 2018. We have submitted proposals for amendments with the aim of extending this contribution to other financial transactions beyond 31 December 2018 and until the entry into force of this law and the coverage of these costs not only for 2019 but also for 2020. I am thinking of the amendments to Article 3, with which we have tried to improve the traceability of sheep and goat milk by identifying all those involved in production. I am thinking of our proposal for a refinancing of the intervention fund for the olive-oil sector, with a substantial increase from EUR 5 million to EUR 10 million, precisely because of the importance of the specific sector. I am thinking of the issue of xylella, which is why we have tabled amendments providing for an automatic procedure for the eradication of contaminated plants in the infected area or the amendment calling for the establishment of an extraordinary Commissioner responsible for implementing all the measures necessary to stem the spread of the bacterium, not to mention our request for additional resources for the revitalization of processing structures. I am referring to the mills which, due to the decrease in the product, are likely to close. We have done all this without forgetting the real responsibility of the Puglia Region, which has transformed a situation of normal management into a real national emergency. We have also asked, through some amendments, to extend the aid for the weather events of 2018 also to other regions that, like Puglia, have suffered considerable damage. I am thinking of the amendments aimed at providing aid also following other emergencies, such as poultry farms and the sugar and maize sectors, and, last but not least, an increase in the Fund for the Experimental Zooprofiling Institute of the Mezzogiorno, which is carrying out all its activities with its own funds. In short, there are a number of concrete proposals to improve this law, but not only: in the Commission we voted against very few amendments; on some we abstained, but on the vast majority we voted in favour, regardless of the political side that had presented them, considering them all of common sense and in favour of agriculture, even if they were then rejected in their entirety by the majority in government. Too bad, because a further opportunity has been lost to contribute, all together, to one of the most important sectors of our production. Finally, I would point out that, despite the rejection of the entire package of amendments proposed by Brothers of Italy, through the work in the Commission, our Group has managed at least to obtain some commitments, thanks to the transformation of four of our amendments into as many agendas, all accepted by the Government, also in the Chamber. These are common sense measures, ranging from support to farms at risk of closure due to the decline in milling and the recognition of contributions to support the mills and processing cooperatives in order to support the production capacity of olive oil, to the extension of measures for the competitiveness of agricultural enterprises in the cereals sector, also to the cultivation of maize and, finally, to the facilitation of the prevention and control of infections in poultry farms. We hope that these commitments will actually be honoured by the Government, effectively pursuing the aim of relaunching a sector in deep suffering, which is proper to this measure. For these reasons, I declare the abstaining vote of the Brothers of Italy Group and ask you to allow me to conclude, Mr President, with an appeal to the Government, to the Minister and, in particular, to the Undersecretary in particular. The measure to our examination tries to give solutions to some emergencies, perhaps the major ones, but certainly not all: it would have been preferable to widen the horizon of intervention. The aid and everything we are doing is good, because the agricultural sector needs it anyway, but in all this there is no real and concrete intervention on the biggest emergency that stifles our agriculture, that is, bureaucracy, Mr Undersecretary. Our farmers, farmers and fishermen and the entire processing chain suffer continuously - as if it were an emergency, like atmospheric events - for an asphyxiating bureaucracy, which sees our companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, fighting daily with a system that prevents them from producing and working with tranquility. Nobody, be it clear, wants to avoid compliance with the rules, as long as they are simple and understandable. Mr Undersecretary, speak with the Government on what is the real and greatest emergency in the agricultural world.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.550325334072113, 0.4496746361255646]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> D\\'ANNA (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity to say in this House a few days ago (but the Minister was not present at the time), that even peritonitis leaves 48 hours. And when we have to put our hands on a fundamental part of our Constitution, which is its second part, all this speed, all this raging to stay within dates that are very close, they presuppose other purposes than the willingness to make this change in Parliament\\'s classrooms. I then had the opportunity to say that, from the procedural point of view, we had to work on an act that was not a parliamentary initiative, but rather of the Commission, which was not quite right. There has been a great deal of talk about the fact that the rules of the game are modified and we are competing to modify them all together, but it really seems a paradox that it is the Government (the power constituted at that time) that proposes this change of rules. I also believe that some form of obstruction, if necessary, we will do so, just as we experienced it when the center-right was majority in these classrooms. We will, yes, but from the point of view of the dispute over what we believe is not right. And it seems to me very strange, even from the somewhat apodictic statements that the Minister has made this morning in this House, that it is not our right to make us feel on the points on which we do not agree. It seems to me that a large part of the dispute and malumors is focused on the fact that we do not like a Senate that is not elective and its combined arrangement with Italicum (which is ready as electoral law). Basically, beyond the panagirics and the twists of words, we will be faced, when, unfortunately, this should become the law of the State, to the fact that we have practically conculcated the freedom and the right that the Italian people have to choose parliamentarians. That\\'s what this is all about, and that\\'s all. Therefore, we cannot understand why an animated government, to say of the Prime Minister and Minister Boschi, from all good sentiments towards the collaboration that must come in the parliamentary classrooms on these issues, gets in the head and makes this issue a boundary: as if to make the people choose their representatives is to be considered as the columns of Hercules between what is the old and what is the new. I, as a good liberal, am conservative and progressive. I tend to preserve freedom when it is threatened, and I am progressive when other spaces of freedom still need to be conquered. What I did not like and perhaps gave rise to this speech was the trenchant judgment that the Minister gave on the fact that whoever wanted to modify this plant belonged to the category of retrogrades, to the nostalgics of an Italy that in 30 years did not want to change things. Mr. Minister, you can change things for the worse. <p> Change as such is therefore an adjectivation, but not always a positive one, because change does not necessarily mean change for the better or change what is needed for change itself. <p> Just as I found it completely out of place - but perhaps part of the governmental dialectic - to call crazy those who are not there! Well, if I have to call Thomas More and what Erasmus said from Rotterdam in the \"Morias Enkomion\", hurrah God exists the \"Praise of madness\"! In fact, from \"Il capetto a rattles\" by Pirandello to \"Man and Galantuomo\" by Eduardo are constantly called mad all those who have an attitude of frankness, all those who fail to follow what Thomas Mann called \"the highway,\" at the bottom of which there are always conformism, opportunism and mediocrity. <p> So, let the government give us the license of fools - for the truth, I personally caught it also in other locations - God lives, Madam Minister, to say it with Eduardo, that in a famous dialect poem concludes saying \"and even you meet \\'to death look \\'on my face no fear \\'or myself, because to me it is scary \\'or fool! \" (Translated with Google Translate) \" (Translated with Google Translate) I translate: you must be afraid of fools, conformists, those who do not have the courage and freedom to express their opinions. So that you, with an angelic face and an elegant and persuasive act, give us madness just because we do not want to vote on this hypothesis of reform seems to me actually a little exaggerated. <p> Do so, either in the Commission or outside the Commission: tell your President-in-Office that it is enough to introduce the electivity of the Senate, that it is enough to introduce preferences into Italicum! <p> These elementary changes that bring sovereignty back to the people are enough, because the Senate cannot be the after-work of the Regional Councillors, nor must the sad history of a leaderism and a peronism that no longer have reason to be; the Baston leaders and party leaders are such only if they are chosen and if their political line can be confirmed by the voters. <p> On the other hand, Madam Minister, it is better a few more fools than some rather silly courtesan servant, who bends not to the wind of his own science and awareness, but to the scranno of Minister or to the fact that he has to say yes to the powerful on duty! <p> You learn this notion, you don\\'t treat us as people who have little sense of duty, because we don\\'t want, we can\\'t and we don\\'t have to vote for this reform.

Unfortunately, the government calls for confidence on this measure. <p> I read the statements made by President Conte, who said this morning: \"No to fences, politics must set an example, and that there is a constant confrontation between the Government and the oppositions.\" At this point, I do not know what to say except, with calmness but also really much bitterness, that in reality it would have been much more respectful for the country and especially for all the categories that are at the forefront, that fight against the virus and that are carrying out the country, if this measure had been approved - not to chat or in words - with the unanimous vote of all. It would have been nice to see tomorrow the Senate unanimously approve the measure cure Italy, this yes would have been symbolically a good example of national unity. <p> Dear Undersecretary, I greatly appreciated the work you have done all these days. That is precisely what we have been working on for days and days in order to be able to vote together on this measure, but in fact we are not allowed to do so, despite everything that has happened in these days. Mr Quagliariello first asked if the government wanted to do it alone. The Government continues to do so alone; unity and responsibility are merely appearances. Forza Italia and the whole centre-right, without any obstructionist spirit - we have shown - have tried to propose a series of solutions, from school to agriculture, from families to workers and businesses. There were hours and hours of video conferencing. In the face of all this, the government has made no commitment. We are told that the resources for this decree-law have been spent, we will go to reason on the next but we do not know when and what resources there will be. All wasting time? What good is it then to be here today to discuss and intervene? As a testimony - now only such - of this famous national unity? We have made a number of proposals. As you know, Mr Undersecretary, we have withdrawn a great many amendments, but those on which we have tried to continue working with you have all been rejected. Many have been reminded of the issue of the denseness of out-of-office students and our proposal to use citizenship income recipients for the emergency. This is not scandalous; everyone has to make their own contribution. I also recall the proposal to increase the salary of doctors, nurses and all health workers and, above all, our amendment on the temporary re-introduction of vouchers for an emergency period, which would give everyone a breath of oxygen: agriculture, crafts, personal services and traders. It was a total closure that I consider unjustified. I wonder what all these hours and hours of opposition meetings were for. Nobody saw the April decree. You even told us that you could not accept some of our proposals because you were ideologically opposed. But what does \"ideologically\" mean? You have the duty, together with us, to do the good of the country, not ideological wars. It\\'s not national cohesion! That\\'s enough, though. Enough with this regime propaganda. The President-in-Office of the Council, who invades and pervades information with his \"sermons,\" has done enough. The other day, President Conte made the Italians believe that he was giving money to the municipalities, and it wasn\\'t, because it was just an advance. He lied to businessmen, because he told them that he was giving 400 billion euros, while it is just a loan, among other things with interest. <p> This is incitement to illusion. <p> Mr President, citizens and businesses do not deserve this. Citizens and businesses now need money and certainty, immediate non-refundable compensation and economic support to move forward. How do we start with phase 2, if phase 1 is not finished yet and if, when phase 2 begins, maybe the country will be finished? I remind this government that the more it demands trust, the more it does not deserve a government to trust it. I conclude by quoting Cardinal Suenens: \"Whoever lights a light in the dark expects mosquitoes.\" We tried to make a contribution. We tried to improve the measure with you.

The sanctioning apparatus imagined is completed, on the one hand, with the confiscation of the goods that are the product or profit of the crime or that have been instrumental to it, and, on the other hand, with the obligation for the sentenced to the recovery and, if possible, the restoration at own expense of the state of the places. Finally, a reward mechanism for reducing penalties is envisaged for those who work with the authorities prior to the definition of the judgment, also to avoid further harmful consequences, and for those who secure, clean up or restore the status of the places. <p> The measure identifies solutions to a serious emergency that has been affecting our country for years and in particular the southern regions, to which we have not been able to give a strong and concrete response. The problem of the abuse of our territories is before everyone's eyes, but it seems to us that this bill is misconceived and, rather than being a first step in resolving the environmental issue, it is inevitably destined to increase confusion and uncertainty in this matter. We believe that we need more precise and specific definitions of new crimes, which we have proposed with our amendments. This was also the view of the 1st Commission, the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which stated the need to fully respect the principle of determining the criminal case. Only in the face of a precise and well-defined notion of crime can the culprits actually be struck and not leave an area of uncertainty in the interpretation of the norm that can hinder or unfairly affect the activities of honest entrepreneurs who want to carry out their work in a correct manner. <p> The solution certainly cannot be represented by new crimes linked to such high penalties as to reach up to twenty years of imprisonment. Our proposals to bring the penalties back to an acceptable and actually applicable level are linked to a precise consideration: such a highly sanctioning system is made even more ineffective and harmful if we consider that the limitation periods are doubled. The result is that a citizen can be subjected to a permanent crime, so to speak, in which the certainty and stability of the order is denied, just as the right to defence and a fair trial is denied. <p> On the other hand, the introduction of reward mechanisms, which have a common foundation because they make the person involved responsible for reducing the harmful consequences of his behavior, is rendered ineffective. For example, what interest can there be in reclamation and security of the territory if it is then confiscated by the public authority? The incentive for active repentance must necessarily be greater, providing, as our Group has proposed, to exclude confiscation in the event that the defendant has effectively put in place the conduct of active repentance. At the same time, longer deadlines are needed than those provided for in this measure in order to give the possibility to carry out the repair actions. <p> I would also like to stress the usual inconsistency of the Government that, completely distant from the reality of things, with the decree thousandprorogues cuts almost 10 million euros for the surveillance of the land of fires. This is one of the most painful aspects of the environmental problem in the Mezzogiorno, where an area between Naples and Caserta has been tormented for too many years by illegal practices that have led to the burial of toxic waste and where there is a very high percentage of mortality for cancers and leukemias. The Government has thought well to remove the already scarce resources in order to limit the problem and instead to allocate them to the EXPO of Milan, to guarantee the security anti-terrorism of the event. <p> To conclude, we are faced with a bill which is once again made up of unnecessarily punitive provisions, counterproductive to the important objectives it has set itself and which will increase legal confusion and uncertainty for citizens. The result will be to have unenforceable standards, which are not even a first step forward in solving a widespread state of environmental emergency and which has a direct and extremely damaging impact on everyone's life.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5063086748123169, 0.4936913847923279]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Mr Pagliari (<PARTY>).

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Grand Autonomous and Freedom Group will vote in favour of motion for a resolution No 3. However, we cannot forget that today we are evaluating a document in a somewhat abnormal situation. It was, in fact, prepared by a Government that is no longer in office and that had in its programmatic references proposals different from those of the current Government. The DEF is still lacking in our examination of the National Reform Programme provided for by the Accounting Act. The Monti Government had not presented it; in its place there is only an analysis of the implementation of the approved reforms, which, moreover, saw the Mezzogiorno in a position of constant subalternity and penalization. A large part of the DEF plant is therefore overtaken. The Letta Government will have to prepare the National Reform Programme and send it to the Chambers together with the Update Note to the DEF, to be presented as soon as possible, taking into account the programmatic indications of April 29, on which the Government has requested and obtained, confidence. This debate then becomes basically an opportunity for this Government: an opportunity to listen to Parliament\\'s thoughts regarding the preparation of the Update Note. Then there will be the real debate on economic policy choices. I would like to remind you that the Letta Government\\'s policy statements propose non-negligible changes in fiscal policies. We are talking about the suspension and abolition of the IMU (which is what we are asking for) and the renunciation of the application of the increase in the VAT rate: choices over which new and different revenue or expenditure cuts will have to be foreseen to cover the lower revenue; conditions that obviously could not be considered in the DEF. But first of all there is the need to determine a real change of course starting from the valorization of the resources that up to now have remained underused. And the first great resource underused, in our opinion, is represented by our Mezzogiorno. If the South resumes to grow, the whole of Italy starts again; Italy grows if the South grows, says the SVIMEZ: \"Italy must rely heavily on the possibility to reactivate the development of the South, defining the conditions that, with immediate anti-conjunctural effectiveness, have the breath of an action aimed at strategic objectives of national value.\" We have a series of emergencies: the first is that of work, in particular that of young people and women. We need more work, more work for everyone; we need work in the South. In Germany, half of the population is permanently occupied. Job stability is reduced to 38% in our country and even stable work in the Mezzogiorno is below 28%. Unemployment figures are dramatic: 11.6 percent, twice as high as the 2007 figures, and it is estimated that unemployment levels in the South account for 39% of young people and 50% of young women. These are dramatic data that determine a perverse spiral that inhibits every possibility of development. And short-term estimates are not encouraging, without considering the forecasts of international bodies that provide us with even more worrying data. We need to relaunch welfare, not by restricting ourselves to social security and shock absorbers and by identifying in this revival not only an opportunity to improve the quality of citizenship, but a concrete opportunity to build a new season of cohesion, which is what our country needs. The defence of the weakest and a credible system of protection against poverty can themselves become a flywheel to restart a positive spiral for development. In this regard, I would like to point out that expenditure is reduced due to the known economic difficulties and that Italian families have also reduced expenditure in two essential areas such as food, with a 3% reduction and even health, with a 2.5% reduction. These figures are worrying, not only because poverty risks sucking up thousands of families, but also overall, for the whole economy, which suffers in a very serious way. We must focus on the development of the territory, the environment and cultural heritage, especially in the Mezzogiorno. In such an important choice, it is also possible to identify extraordinary opportunities for development and new occupations. But it will not be possible to have an authentic revival of the development if one forgets to promote the strengthening and the completion of the infrastructural and logistic networks, lacking, above all to the South, rethinking, for example the choices on the Bridge of the previous Government and aiming on the improvement and, on the completion of the railway net in Sicily and the Regions of the Mezzogiorno. There will be no recovery unless there is the capacity to promote the integration of the southern production system into the international market with appropriate support measures. There will be no revival if we do not aim at energy sources, especially renewable ones, particularly important for the South and also for the whole country, to help achieve the objective, fundamental for the national economy, of reducing the rate of dependence on energy from abroad. We look forward to the Additional Note to the DEF, on which we know that Minister Saccomanni is working, but we want to highlight some priorities: to anticipate to 1 July 2013 the deductions of the IRAP that the law of stability provides only from 2014 (I remember: 7,500 euros of deductions for permanent employees, 13.500 euros for women and the under 35, that become 15,000 and 21,000 euros in the areas of the Mezzogiorno); to increase the deductions for small enterprises, those that have less than 10 employees, especially in the Mezzogiorno; to revise the Stability Pact, administering the oxygen that serves municipalities and enterprises; to revive fiscal federalism, allowing the municipalities to have the resources that derive from the taxation of their competence. A moment ago we exchanged with Senator Calderoli this consideration: we fly high - and it is right - but we are careful, because we risk planing and finding the majority of our municipalities \"jumped.\" We are still calling for a 50% increase in deductions for dependent children: this would be a fundamental step for low and medium-income families and especially for those in southern areas. We also need to rethink the possibility of creating large areas of benefit taxation and these initiatives must be put into practice in Europe: they could be a model to suggest to Europe\\'s friends for all disadvantaged areas. It is precisely the lack of a comprehensive strategy and serious coordination that has led to the failure of the policies put in place so far. The goal is therefore to achieve an interactive process between the Southern Regions and the Central Government, a process that will once again ensure unity and a unique strategic vision for the development of the country.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6069279909133911, 0.3930720388889313]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, frankly, the debate we are having in this House at other times would certainly have interested me. Given the situation of our Italy, in the light of the show made yesterday by the President of the Council, probably to the Italians, who were also evoked yesterday and who would have been asked if they had an interest in gender equality (it was recalled by a colleague that 67 percent replied that he has an interest in this speech), we should also ask if they prefer that those in the Senate (as long as there will be, because it seems that Renzi has a personal matter with the Senate and the senators, but we will see this separately) concentrate on this matter or try to understand, for example, in the matter of reducing the cost of work, where we go to find the resources, which to date seem to be smoky. Maybe we could go further on the issue of the discrepancy between the EUR 7 billion announced by your President-in-Office and the EUR 3 billion still mentioned by the spending review officer. I would like to understand, in terms of payments by public administrations to businesses, why the former Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance continues to speak of a certain amount while the current Government speaks of different figures. Of the two: if all this money has suddenly appeared, it means that the Monti and Letta Governments, which have always been supported by you, until yesterday they told us, not so much as the Italians, a series of lies. It would probably be more useful to discuss the real reforms, which we tried to launch in 2006, but against which a referendum was put in place by the same people who are talking about these reforms today. It would be useful to understand and understand that the operation and the simplification of the machine-state is important and direct to get our Italy out of the droughts of the crisis. Always with reference to reforms, it should be understood that a Senate - also on this today we are on the level of smokes - that today, at best, goes to do the duplication of the State-Regions Conference does not serve Italy and the Italians. How should we understand, always dealing with reforms, that, when it comes to the abolition of the Provinces, in reality, the attempt is to propose them in absolutely different terms, at higher costs, whatever your President-in-Office says, and as the Court of Auditors has also pointed out. Perhaps these are the issues on which we should be entertained, as well as the fact that, it is said, these covers will also be derived from a different taxation of financial incomes: when you go to Europe to say that the BOTs are out, I do not know if Europe will consent to this type of transaction. It is reasonable to think that, when this is announced, perhaps a mechanism is set in motion to resolve itself in a capital flight, which will eventually lead us to the taxation of the usual known, with perhaps an asset. And on this issue we must understand, for example, whether even the savings not made in BOT by the many families - I am referring to long-term savings - will be affected by this higher and different taxation. We should also have another subject: when you ask for an extraordinary contribution to gold pensions, because those who will take 2,500 euros, paid with contributions during their working life, fall into the golden pensions, I wonder if this pensioner is really cataloguable among the golden pensioners, expected to take 1,000 euros more than those that should be benefited and that are below 1,500 euros. Perhaps it would be appropriate, going to another area, to ask ourselves, given that the issue of democracy rightly arises, even talking about this proposal for a law, how is it possible in a democracy that a few hundred meters from here - I am referring to the Chamber rooms - for years is on track a sort of Big Brother who has been recording and recording the phone calls of all the parliamentarians. What does that mean? Who ordered it? However, we are here to talk about this measure. A measure on which, moreover, the government in office has never presented itself to the Commission, except yesterday afternoon, and essentially - as the rapporteur has told us - it has not provided any more technical insights. Given that we are not interested in the male-girl derby, I would like to point out once again an aspect that has emerged: our nation, without a great need for particular laws, has an average of 31 percent elected. I would point out that the European countries where this type of stakes have been introduced have, in fact, put in place an action that has then resolved negatively in terms of the election of female colleagues. Throughout Europe we see that, where there is a greater presence of elected persons, this happens not so much by virtue of laws, stakes, reserves, quotas (call them as you wish), but of a cultural process that, lively, exists in those parts, and probably the task of laws like this should be to facilitate these kinds of processes, not already to impose them. There is no problem, obviously on spaces - also here you have fun to call them as you want - so that the presence of women is repeated in the lists: what I find frankly non-drinking is the imposition, the obligatory preference. I have been taught that politics is a comparison and a search for consensus, and on this channel I obviously insert myself. Preferences of which, however, when we talk about other laws, everyone has the sacred terror, and we always take refuge in these de facto blocked lists, and, in this regard, the discourse could be long: I do not understand why the blocked list of thirty names is unconstitutional and instead that of six has become constitutional. Evidently in this country we make constitutionalities by weight. I should also like to conclude by pointing out that this issue is obviously not very much heard in Europe, given that it has been addressed in other terms and ways. It was clearly not particularly felt that, not later than the day before yesterday, a motion for a resolution which submitted this subject was rejected by the sender. So, probably the way should be to strike a healthy balance, in order to avoid, in fact, just one thing: a damage to women and colleagues who wish to engage in this electoral battle.

This path goes through stages of negotiation managed by the Government, in which the main concern of those who have to deal with it should be to take into account the national interest of our companies, our citizens and our social and economic fabric. European decisions, in fact, in all their questionable forms, affect the political, social and economic life of our country, not to mention their ability to affect health and nutrition. <p> The rapporteur correctly said that the text consists of 21 articles and that there has been a very lively debate in the Commission, but most of our amendments were and are of common sense, as has already happened to the House, and certainly improvements to the text. Therefore, if this Government really cared about the fate of our citizens and our businesses, I wonder why there have not been really serious discussions in the Committees on the merits and the purpose of these amendments has not been thoroughly analysed. <p> The arguments contained in the measure are clearly heterogeneous, both by subject matter and by competence. We are talking about labelling olive oils, honey, increasing VAT on risotto preparations to cover a different tax on gambling; we are talking about European student vehicles in Italy, VAT rates, basil, rosemary and fresh sage, truffles and compensation for victims of violent international crimes, provisions on the nature of wildlife; moreover, the measure contains recommendations from the National Railway Safety Agency and much more. These are certainly heterogeneous issues, Madam President, of which we recall Articles 1, 2, 21, 22 and 23, which do not remedy sanctions but intervene on EU Pilot cases which limit the values of transparency and correctness of information. These articles denote the renunciation that this Government continues to hold precisely in the agro-food sector, which should instead constitute the international pride of our made in Italy. Madam President, if we want to get into this matter, I must say that I am well aware of Mr Gozi, because we have spent an entire parliamentary term in the 14th Chamber Commission; we were both Presidents: I in the ascending phase and he in the descending phase of the formation of European standards. In those clothes many times we have faced each other and sometimes even in a piccato way, but always in the correctness of those who try to bring good to their country. However, it must be said that Europe as we understand it is not exactly that. We want a Europe that is attentive to the citizens, to the specificities of its territories, to the ability of every nation to enable citizens to make the best of their productive and entrepreneurial capacities. One of the most bald regulations we have considered in this period is the Bolkestein directive, which not many days ago has caused problems related to those who are managing our coasts. I would also like to address the President-in-Office of the Council who was talking about improvements here and there: perhaps we should have more strength and attention when we are invited to three at a very important table such as the one following Brexit and the British vote: perhaps we should understand that this invitation is only due to the fact that probably, if a referendum of that kind had been held in this country, the same result would have been achieved. The problem in this country is very simple: we have neither an industrial plan nor an energy plan. We didn't even have a strategy for tourism... president. Please conclude.

I repeat that we must remain calm because, if agriculture can earn a living, it will all be natural: children will go to schools, they will go to school and so on. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has done a lot, but we have checked that these funds have often been insufficient, and in line with the financing of productive activities for young people it should be stepped up.

The Agreement, which follows the model of the 1957 Council of Europe Convention, consists of 11 articles. <p> Article 2 in particular introduces rules on the non-applicability of the death penalty. Articles 3 and 4 provide for a number of cases where there may be a refusal to extradite (political crimes, well-founded fears that there are risks of discrimination against the person, cases of amnesty or grace, etc.). The Convention's rules restricting extradition in the field of customs and exchange charges and taxes are also repealed. The Agreement does not involve financial burdens for our country. <p> The second Agreement is intended to allow the transfer into its State of citizenship of citizens held in the territory of the other State, in order to facilitate their re-education and reintegration. The instrument is necessary because Morocco did not accede to the 1983 Council of Europe Convention and the subsequent 1987 Additional Protocol. <p> The Convention under consideration, consisting of 22 articles, provides that the transfer of prisoners does not apply to persons with dual nationality and also applies only if the judgment is enforceable, if the period to be atoned is longer than the year and if the offence committed is foreseen as such by the other State as well. The transfer may be requested by the State, but under no circumstances may it take place without the express consent of the sentenced person. The Convention provides, in any case, that the prisoner cannot be tried, arrested and condemned for the same facts that have already led to the conviction in the other State. There are also forecasts in relation to the documents to be submitted in support of the transfer application, the language of translation of the documents, the manner of delivery of the transferred person and so on. <p> The draft ratification law consists of four articles which form the basis for the authorisation of ratification, order of implementation, financial coverage and entry into force of the texts. The charges, based on an estimate of 200 annual transfers, are estimated at around 340,000 euros per year. <p> Finally, it is pointed out that the two bilateral agreements do not present profiles of incompatibility with national legislation, with the European Union's legal system and with the other international obligations assumed by our country. I would point out that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Emigration approved an amendment to the text of the draft law, receiving the opinion of the Budget Commission. <p> It is therefore proposed that the Assembly approve this measure.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5862966179847717, 0.4137033522129059]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, I would like to start with a note: even looking at this House this morning, I have to say that sometimes it is much more succulent and it seems more stimulating to discuss the subject of procurement when it comes to criminal sanctions and criminal offences, while the media also devote less attention to this matter when it comes to talking about it in order to try to correct the system and identify those mechanisms that can prevent and avoid rushing towards the results of illegality and the consequent criminal sanctions. It has already been emphasized by those who have preceded me the importance of the measure, for which I believe it must be addressed not rhetorical but sincere thanks, to the rapporteurs, to the Commission as a whole and - let me say - also to the President, who led an important work, for which he has given the House a text that has its consistency, perceptible and readable, where a subject such as this, for the thickening of convergent and at the same time divergent interests (if I pass the oxymoron) that concentrate on the subject of procurement, could have imploded in a coacervo of norms without their clear physiognomy and identity. This is not the case, and I believe that legality, transparency, simplification, efficiency and quality are the fundamental pillars that this text gives to our debate and I hope that we will also approve it. A number of points have already been mentioned in the previous speeches. I would like to highlight a few of them: as far as legality and transparency are concerned, it is important to have eliminated some of the mechanisms that Dr. Cantone rightly called criminogens, such as the general contractor's ability to appoint the direction of the works in the great works or the systematic use of the mechanism of maximum decrease. The gears that have allowed the proliferation of corruptive elements and the multiplication of the costs of the works have therefore been affected. Of course, the measure is not just about public works, but I am particularly concerned about this, because that is what I know best. Equally important, as has already been mentioned, is the part of the measure which aims, not only to reduce the number of contracting stations and to break the chain that very often binds the Selection Boards to those who apply in the notices to obtain the award of the works, but to achieve the objective of decreasing and at the same time requalifying the contracting stations. Because the big issue raised by the measure is not only about the prevention of corruption and the contiguity between criminality, organised crime and the procurement system, but also about the return of effectiveness and efficiency to a system that unfortunately sees us, in many respects, of cinderellae in the European panorama. Therefore, the effort made in the direction of the qualification of the contracting stations is really very important. There are many things to remember: to conclude, I want to dwell on a couple of aspects that I consider crucial. The first relates to a very important passage in my view contained in the measure under consideration. I am referring - and I am talking about it, because I was the one who made the declaration of vote of the Democratic Party Group on the so-called Italy release - to the qualitative leap that is being made today in relation to the system of motorway concessions, which certainly constitutes a great issue for this country, even if not the only one. Now, having courageously decided to introduce substantially 100% of the public evidence into all the mechanisms that the dealers in operation put in place to carry out the work, I believe it is a qualitative leap in the sign of the very important transparency, but that also helps the organization and the growth of the system of the enterprises, equally important issue: urges the companies to confront the market, to strengthen and to grow, rather than dedicate their time to tracing the most useful paths to bind themselves to predetermined strings that place them in the condition of being able to work. This is a fundamental element for the qualitative leap of our system. It is also very important to have established that this country must be in a position to entrust the motorway concessions through public races. I would like to stress, however, on this point, a need for the Deputy Minister. We need to restore the system of control and surveillance of motorway concessions with more solidity and effectiveness; a system which, since the dismantling of IVCA, has in fact been dormant. I say this because otherwise we can foresee the best mechanisms for the custody of concessions, but if then no one incisively controls how concessions are made we do not solve the problem. I look at one last aspect, and I finish. As I think it will have been noted - and I agree with this approach - in this text we entrust a significant role to the Anti-corruption Authority, and I believe it is important because the procurement system unfortunately today records a serious disease that requires this redundancy of the role of ANAC with respect to the normal functions of control and supervision, also in actively contributing to the development and operation of the system. Since the rules are also being made in the contingent situation, I very much agree with this approach, but I would like to take up a point I made in the Commission as well. The hope I express is that this intensive care, which is now being used by using this instrument and this involvement of ANAC, will help to get the patient out of the condition of serious illness in which he is now in order to return to a system in which today those who have to monitor and control do that, and overall an improved, simplified and retrained system of contracting stations succeeds in carrying out their profession with full autonomy. This would be, in fact, the best indicator that Italy has healed from a disease that drags it to the bottom of the European rankings also on this side, and finally it has become a normal country in which companies can compete on a transparent market and compete with the public administration to the overall growth of the country and the realization of works of good quality made in certain times, with certain costs and in the best harmonization with the territories in which they go to place. The measure before us helps us to go in this direction, and I therefore believe that it should be welcomed with all the positiveness of the case.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5224221348762512, 0.4775778353214264]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Milo (<PARTY>).

In this regard, I point out that since 2009 the \"Dossier Violence - stories of ordinary madness\" has been written by the national executive of the Italian Federation of General Medicine Doctors, which brings a complaint mainly concerning women who are in the positions of the medical guard, often targeted. In this regard, we recall an episode that took place at Tor Bella Monaca in 2010, when a doctor on duty barricaded her in the room because of a criminal who threatened her with death. I do not go into the details for reasons of time, but I would like to stress that the president of the Federation of Medical Orders, Roberta Cersevani, proposed yesterday to move medical guards inside the police stations or in the police stations to ensure safety at the doctors\\' workplaces, targeted because alone and at night. The same kind of need arises for other professions that are at risk of violence: those of women who work alone in police posts, such as security personnel, restaurant and hotel employees, taxi drivers, bus drivers and so on.

Certainly the pandemic, before, and the war, now, did not help, but it had become customary also in the previous legislatures to see an occupation of spaces by the various governments on purely legislative competences, on issues that must be dealt with in the parliamentary classrooms by those who are elected by the Italian citizens and represent them. If Parliament finds improvements to the text proposed by the Commission, we should all work in the same direction. <p> The measure in our examination is fundamental to the obtaining of the funds of the PNRR and also to avoid that infringement procedures are initiated against our country. It is absolutely necessary, however, to understand where the balance lies between the interests of Europe and those of Italy, because sometimes they are conflicting and a simple flattening on Europeanistic positions does not mean doing the interests of our fellow citizens. <p> Ladies and gentlemen, we are frank and aware: without a reform of the public administration for the simplification of procedures and the deburocratization we will not go anywhere. <p> ; a public administration often oriented towards maintaining its status quo, which relieves and dumps on citizens all kinds of burdens and responsibilities, almost forgetting that those who choose to work in this area should have as I do the interest of citizens rather than become the office complications simple business. Without this reform the valuable work done with this bill will also be watered down. In addition to the subject of bathing concessions, which has been raised more to the news, local public services, energy, waste, transport and health care are among the measures addressed. The Members who preceded me and those who will follow will enter into detail and substance of the various issues. Personally, however, I propose a reflection on the companies in house to remember how often the municipalities have often constituted these companies because the market did not offer solutions and it is not or was not economical. Just think of the services that connect morphologically difficult territories to reach. Parliament's work has also taken account of these aspects. The last thought goes to the great work done on the issues of health, where we have tried to find a balance starting from the fundamental need to ensure effective, appropriate and safe treatment routes especially in cases of particularly serious and disabling diseases. Monitoring and control of all facilities providing health services is essential to ensure the quality of services, fair access and eliminate opacity where health services are provided with public finance charges. A very important work has been carried out on equivalent drugs to make them readily available while respecting intellectual property rights. Research must continue fully in the interests of all.

Poverty in which a child lives, not by choice, carries a very high risk of social exclusion and condemns a large part of the population to a destiny of marginality. This determines for society a load of deviance, which can undermine at the base any possibility of economic and social development of the entire country. <p> The investment on human capital is fundamental for the future of the country and it must be implemented with concrete long-term and wide-ranging interventions, in place of sporadic and rainy financing. Clear, organic and evaluable programmes are needed so that they can also be economically productive. <p> The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out in a comprehensive manner the fundamental rights which must be recognised and guaranteed to all children. The Convention is based in particular on four priority principles: non-discrimination, providing that the rights enshrined in the Convention must be guaranteed to all minors without distinction; the interest of the child or teenager must be given priority in any public or private initiative; the right to life, to survival and to the development of the child; the right of children to be heard in all decision-making processes affecting them. <p> A number of instruments for the protection and control of children's rights have been put in place in recent years. A Parliamentary Committee on Children has been set up by several legislatures, with the task of monitoring, among others, the compliance of national legislation with EU legislation and the principles laid down in the 1989 Convention. The Guarantee Authority for Children and Adolescence has even been established in order to ensure full implementation and protection of the rights and interests of persons of younger age. Recently the House, inserting special rules in the law of stability, has refinanced its deserving activities. <p> With the ratification of the Lanzarote Convention, Parliament has tightened the penalties for the exploitation and induction of child prostitution, including through the introduction of two new crimes: the incitement to paedophilia and child pornography and the solicitation of minors. <p> However, limits remain to equal educational and growth opportunities, also conditioned by excessive fragmentation of skills in relation to family issues, also due to a number of wrong fiscal choices, which have not paid due attention to the respect of rights and the condition of the lives of children. <p> The essential levels of performance must be defined, without unequal access, in order to address the North-South gap. We need to invest in supporting the study and remove the causes of school dispersal. <p> ISTAT tells us that they live in situations of relative poverty of 1,822,000 minors, equal to 17.6 percent of all children and adolescents. Seven percent of minors, equal to 723,000 people, live in absolute poverty. This situation is very different depending on the place of birth: it is 10.9% in the Mezzogiorno, compared with 4.7% in the Centre and in the North of the country. According to the latest data, there are 758,000 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 who have left school prematurely or any other form of training. The phenomenon of early school leaving unfortunately continues to affect the Mezzogiorno to a greater extent. <p> According to surveys by the organization Save the Children, we are faced with a real childhood emergency, for which almost 32 percent of children under the age of six live at the limits of poverty and 23.7% live in a state of material deprivation. In contrast to this, the data of the Ministry of Health show how the phenomenon of obesity begins especially at an early age, between six and ten years, demonstrating that more than one in six suffers from the pathology. <p> Of course, the family has a fundamental and irreplaceable educational role. Parents who spend most of their free time dedicating themselves to their children impose sound rules and sound principles on them; at the same time, they keep them away from the tempting dangers of the network, that is, those websites considered uncomfortable. <p> However, in general, protecting children from poverty is an ethical and moral duty that should be a priority for every government, since today's children and adolescents will be the citizens of tomorrow and compromising their future means undermining the foundations and the very future of society. A society that respects itself must also be able to activate so-called social lifts and enhance meritocracy by facilitating access to the study, without cost, for the most deserving and consequent access to public and private careers. The same Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is now an integral part of the Treaty of Lisbon, states that the right of the child to the protection and treatment necessary for his or her well-being is paramount. <p> The even more dramatic figure of poverty in all its forms is manifested by the removal of minors from the family because of the poverty of the family itself. It is a shocking effect, which should be enough alone to shake consciences and activate interventions as soon as possible, in order to guarantee the child to grow up in his family, as provided for in article 315-bis of the Civil Code, appropriately introduced by law n. 219 of 2012, laying down provisions on the recognition of natural children. In this regard, the Senate Justice Commission, after a long debate started in March 2014, has dismissed bill No 1209, amending Law No 184 of 4 May 1983 on the adoption of minors by foster families, which will shortly be before the Assembly.

Many had then considered that the new dangerous challenges were only those brought by Islamic fundamentalism, after the attack on the Twin Towers and in relation to the rise of terrorism. It was believed that the winds of war and repression could come exclusively from some dangerous dictator in North Korea or Venezuela; it was mistakenly believed that the mother of all problems was China's overpowering economy. <p> It had not been understood or underestimated the message born from the end of some European political hegemonies that had led to the destruction, for example, of the former Yugoslavia, a federal reality that shared similar ethnicities, but different, which, after the failure of the political glue given by General Tito, turned into an armed clash without neighborhood, which inflamed the last decade of the last century. <p> Europe and the West should have responded together to these systemic challenges, which are challenges to our values, our culture and our way of life, exporting an idea of Europe and the West to all peoples and nations of Greek-Roman and Jewish-Christian tradition, even those freed from the game of communist dictatorship. <p> In order to do this, it took and takes mediation skills, the art of convergence and strategic vision. It'll take, it'll take, and it'll take capable interpreters. In other words, leadership is needed and political leaders are needed to create the conditions for its implementation. Let me say here that it is all too easy to say and recognize that only one man, one enlightened and capable leader, was able to interpret this political knot; only Silvio Berlusconi understood that between the countries of NATO and Russia had to lay the foundations for a convergence of perspectives and strategic interests and in 2002, in Pratica di Mare, he initiated this virtuous process that would bring a better future for the world, for Europe and for Italy. Malcolm X said that history is the memory of a people and, without a memory, man is reduced to the rank of lower animal. In fact, only those with no political leadership have no memory of it. To think that the ruins of the communist regime, made up of oppression, invasions, repression, the artificial famine with which Stalin massacred millions of Ukrainians, the ruthless repression of the anti-communist patriotic resistance in Lithuania, the Russian tanks in Budapest and Prague, did not deeply mark the sentiment of those peoples once freed from dictatorship not only towards the communist system, but towards the country with which the system identified itself. Those peoples who have chosen the freedom of democracy have turned to Europe, asking to be part of our community of free peoples and we have a duty to be on their side, with those who have joined the Atlantic Alliance and with those who, like Ukraine, with the Atlantic Alliance and Europe were building a relationship of mutuality without any hostile significance towards Russia. On the origin of this conflict there are, in any case, objective elements of discussion such as discrimination of Russian minorities in some areas of Ukraine or the Azov Battalion with mercenaries exhibiting swastikas. It is not our job to exegesis the conflict; the Government and Parliament have a duty to respond to the geopolitical, economic and social context that these events have brought about. The approval of this decree-law, with the first urgent measures, are a tangible sign of the response of the Italian people. Politics also has a duty to prevent wars in the third millennium. We therefore urge the Government to act in the wake of mediation, leading as soon as possible to a ceasefire and an effective negotiating solution. Last but not least, we must reaffirm that where there are violations of territorial sovereignty, where there are pseudo-intelligent bombs, where there is destruction and deaths of civilians, without whether or not but, Forza Italia in the wake of the constitutional dictation, the founding spirit of our movement and in respect of the inalienable rights of the citizens of Italy and of the world, has been, is and will always be on the side of freedom and self-determination of peoples.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5765429139137268, 0.4234570562839508]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, Amendment 2,360 on the composition of the Senate of the Republic accepts the logic of the majority, therefore of a Senate composed of regional representatives.

Senators Quagliariello and Bruno made a valuable contribution to the drafting of this amendment, to a certain extent also the rapporteurs Calderoli and Finocchiaro, Mr Chiti and other members of the Democratic Party and even Matteo Renzi who had evoked him in one of his speeches. Then, suddenly, the proposal was trash. We went to the trash can, to \"explain\" this piece of paper and we took it back in the debate. Sometimes it happens that the best proposal was just the trash. This is a good proposal that came out in the course of the discussion held in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and is different from all the starting positions, both from the one that wanted a direct universal election of the Senate, and from those who want a second-degree election instead. It would therefore be one of those inventions that ripen at the best moments of the constitutional debate, when we agree on an unexpected proposal that puts everyone in agreement without anyone being able to boast of a primacy. I therefore call for a moment of attention and reflection on this amendment, and this would - if I may - not only be an opportunity to solve in the best way a problem that has very much engaged us in the debate, but also a signal to give a new climate to our debate.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5052642822265625, 0.4947356879711151]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, representatives of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the debate and some speeches have left me very surprised. Therefore, I will devote two minutes to them, because I believe that assessments have been made which are absolutely not acceptable and far from reality. <p> I would like, however, in anticipation to acknowledge the Government, President Marino and rapporteur Zeller that they have allowed very fruitful work to be carried out in the Commission, which has seen all the forces of majority and opposition contribute positively to the work and improvement of the measure under consideration today. I also acknowledge Mr Carraro's correctness, as always, because he intervenes in the same way in the Commission and in this House. He, in fact, although he did not fail to show limits and shortcomings from his point of view, acknowledged a positive work, unlike other interventions in which, in the constructive climate recorded in the Commission, then in this House, he followed real propaganda meetings with various insults. <p> On two points, Senators Crimi and Carraro began and closed the debate. Senator Crimi has made a number of critical remarks, stressing the difficulty of credit in supporting the real economy, focusing on the topic of productivity and the need for modernization of industrial machinery. These are all situations absolutely far from reality, since the issue of interventions on the entire credit system and on the strengthening of the banking system is aimed at enabling the improvement of support for the real economy; on the other hand, the measures taken, with the Sabatini law and with the super depreciation, have led to very positive results in the industrial machinery sector, so much so that from this point of view the recovery has been very vigorous and strong in the mechanical and manufacturing sector in which we are world leader. It has, therefore, a double positive effect. If we want to highlight the issue of productivity that has gripped our country for twenty years, I believe that the various and different opinions that have been measured have given us a sense of the difficulty, of the difficult situation that we live in. Until 1995, in fact, the dynamics of our country's productivity has been in line with that of other European countries and in the last twenty years we see a situation of swamps, stagnation, which is a real problem. Probably it is right who among the observers has identified the real cause in the blockade, in paralysis, in the lack of reforms that in the end, in the competition with globalization, and therefore with a global competition, all our country system with its backwardness (from the public administration, to the labour market, to the training, to the tax and to whatever else) has taken advantage and continues to serve. And only now with the vigorous reform season are we trying to get out of this difficulty. On the subject of savings, I would like to point out to Mr Carraro that, at an early stage, we had a recomposition of the stock of household savings that had consumed it in the years of the crisis. In fact, the data tell us that the recovery of GDP, precisely in the face of the difficulties of global trade, is supported by domestic demand, the resumption of building loans, consumer credit, the purchase of cars, houses and so on. There is, in fact, a recovery in confidence and expenditure, which is also supported by some measures. It is true - as you yourself have emphasized - that an important part of our country lives below the poverty line and, therefore, we need measures that go from the income of social inclusion, to the support for the dependent children, to the support to the medium-low incomes, to the renewal of the contracts that, in reality, serve not only to give economic boost to the country and confidence to the people, but also and above all have the value of social justice measures that no longer can be postponed. The decree-law that we are about to convert into law today is an important measure that is part of a comprehensive reform of the Italian banking sector, which in turn is part of the wider process in place at European level. Since the beginning of 2015, the Government has launched a reform process aimed at making credit institutions more competitive and enhancing their role in supporting the real economy. In particular, the reform of popular banks and the most recent reform of cooperative credit banks should be mentioned. The positive effects of the reformative action put in place with these measures will be observed in the coming months, contributing decisively to the strengthening of these banks and, in general, the Italian banking system, promoting their capital consolidation, improving governance models and credit assessment systems of companies, as well as increasing the supply of finance. Within this strategy it is worth remembering that the Government then intervened with several measures on the main obstacle to the restart of the credit, represented by the amount of the deteriorated credits accumulated in the balance sheets of the banks. In this regard, I would like to recall Decree-Law No 83 of 2015 (so-called bankruptcy decree), which introduced measures to make debt recovery more efficient and facilitate the use of negotiated forms of corporate resolution, providing for full and immediate deductibility of credit losses. With this last forecast, the tax treatment of credit write-downs has been aligned with that of the other main countries, allowing to increase provisions on deteriorated loans and to reduce disincentives to their disposal. The subsequent Decree-Law No 16 of 2016 (so-called banking decree) provided for a State guarantee mechanism, at market prices, to cover senior tranches issued in the framework of securitisation operations, carried out in response to the sale by financial intermediaries of non-performing credit portfolios: a central role in facilitating the transfer of non-performing claims and the creation of an efficient market for such claims, which can take place thanks to the important role that will be called upon to play the Atlas Fund. This is a broad strategy which, in line with the new European measures, should reconstruct a new relationship between investors and the credit sector, and between the latter and the real economy, in order to bring them into line with the needs of the current economic situation. Finally, a positive systemic notation concerns the fact that the measure in conversion is part of an overall cultural rethinking of the various procedures that are activated in the face of non-payment of credits. The decree-law, in fact, arrives a short time from the bill delegates for the organic reform of the disciplines of the crisis of enterprise and insolvency where, in line with the orientation adopted by the main European systems, it has been attempted to express a new vision of the state of financial difficulties, even serious, seen as a possible physiological evolution of the cycle of business, to be prevented or managed at best. On the merits of the individual provisions, measures on insolvency proceedings and enforcement procedures are important, in addition to those already launched a few months ago, which, together with the so-called pact, will help to simplify compliance and streamline procedures for the recovery of claims. All the interventions will have a positive impact on the real economy as banks that are more easily covered by their loans will have more space in the budget to lend to companies. As far as the repercussions on the production system are concerned, I should like to point out one thing. The Italian situation with regard to outstanding claims has peculiarities compared to other countries. A coherent response can only move along two lines: to speed up the recovery of banks' claims towards companies, aligning Italian times with the recalled international best practices; to make the guarantee system that assists the financing more flexible, in order to facilitate the acquisition by companies. The legislation introduced and under discussion today is built around these two guidelines, thus responding to a requirement repeatedly represented by the entrepreneurial class, namely to return efficiency and profitability to the credit system in order to ensure greater availability of credit and better conditions, for the benefit of the real economy. In particular, the measures taken will have a positive impact not only on the opening of new funding lines, but also on the renegotiation of existing funding. Thanks to this text, it will be easier for businesses to obtain funding from credit institutions, which can rely on simplified and rapid procedures to recover sums paid in the event of default in payment of instalments. The Marche pact provides for the out-of-court assignment of the property data to guarantee a financing and is the most important novelty among those of the decree-law. It provides for the possibility that, in the event of a loan, the parties may enter into a contract for the transfer of an asset as a guarantee of repayment. In case of default of the debtor, the bank enters into possession of the property in a very simple procedure, without the passage to the judicial system; the debtor is however responsible for the difference between residual debt and the value of the property, which is estimated by an independent expert, appointed by the judge. For the short time available, I will not dwell on other important aspects, but they have been highlighted by various speeches by my colleagues and the rapporteurs. For example, measures affecting financing contracts already concluded and renegotiating these contracts are important; measures amending bankruptcy law and insolvency proceedings, as well as the impact of other important measures such as the non-possession pledge, are important. In essence, the measure under consideration introduces elements of functional rebalancing of the legal and economic system able to favor an effective factor of support to the real economy, contributing to the revival of the productive fabric of the Country. The interests at stake are balanced by safeguarding the principles of good faith and contractual correctness. In the current economic context, it is crucial to ensure that, in the face of an accelerated lane for the recovery of claims, garrisons are introduced capable of generating concrete benefits for companies in terms of the amount, cost and duration of the financing, which will have to be more sustainable for the same companies, contributing, in line with the line adopted by the ECB, to outline a national policy for the anti-cyclical credit.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5247781872749329, 0.4752218425273895]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will focus on some paradoxical aspects that are characterizing this debate with respect to a measure recognised as important by all, on which, on the other hand, a question of constitutionality was raised again the other day and yesterday the question suspended in order to try to block it. <p> The debate on the Zan draft law seems to be about questions of detail, procedure, parliamentary practice, exaggerated delay in timing or not. President Ostellari gave us an essay the other day, claiming the role of the Senate, which is not called upon to ratify the deliberations of the Chamber of Deputies: just, correct; we do not understand, however, the obstructive attitude carried out in recent months by the President of the Justice Commission. <p> Senator Renzi went even further: he recalled that he was for the abolition of the perfect bicameralism but, after the outcome of the referendum, he became a champion of the specific role of the Senate, which, in a few days, can do a mediation that was not possible in eight months. Not only that. According to Renzi, the Senate can create a pact between political forces for rapid approval of the Chamber of Deputies as well. In these political skirmishes all the contents of the measure which is the subject of our debate are absent; they are put in unorganized thesis and antithesis which, in recent months, have filled the pages of the newspapers, but which have not been able to be deepened in this House. Everyone recognizes that the Zan bill is very important, that it must not have a political intestatary, that it cannot risk the secret vote, but that it must be voted in the light of the sun, from the wider array of forces in respect to the vast majority that supports the Draghi Government. It is enough to want to enter into the substance of the content of the Zan bill to understand, as happened in the debate of these two days, that the gap between the political groups is very clear. A great philosopher of the school, Pietro Abelardo - it comes to my mind - found that on various theological questions the judgments of the fathers of the Church were often divergent and sometimes antithetical, he proposed a method that is still at the basis of university teaching: the method of Sic et non, of the quaestiones disputatae, which led to those notebooks quodlibet, fundamental for the growth and development of the debate. Abelard preceded the principle of authority that of reason to come to the head and reasonably take off on a thesis. All the opposite, I think, of what we are trying to do today in this debate. Between the authority of Senator Pillon, who contrasts science with anthropology, and that of Senator Salvini, who proclaims that within this Senate there is no MP who supports archaic gender discrimination, there can be no mediation. Or with respect to the statements of the authority of President Ciriani, according to which family is union between man and woman in function of reproduction there is possible mediation with respect to the authority still of Senator Salvini, who would welcome without any problem to his home the companion or companion of his son? In politics mediation, we know, is necessary, but it must not confuse the waters. I understand that it is better for a party to look at some of the merits for the adoption of a measure recognised as very important, but it would not be a disgrace to vote against or abstain when there are reasonable doubts. The clerics varantes, to return to our Middle Ages, at the end of the examination of the various and sometimes opposite positions in the Sic et were not required to take part, which was not that of an impalpable molasses. This is how a scientific method has been established in our universities. Otherwise, identity flags will be unleashed, which replace quaestiones only with names. However, nominalistic relapse does not help us to improve the knowledge of things and, in the end, if we limit ourselves to it, appoints nude tenemus. For example, the word genre from the Latin genus and from the ancient French genre, then spread in English in the form of gender, is commonly used to refer to models of relationship, expectations, constraints and different opportunities between men and women. In this it is distinguished from the sex that instead refers to the biological nature of the male and the female, therefore to the physiological dimension. Now, around the gender identity syntagma, a highly pretentious spread is developing. It would appear that putting it into law would mean opening the door to a cultural definition of diversity, while not admitting it would limit the definition of law to that of biological characteristics. It\\'s not like that at all. The facts of the case law are quite different. Already the current regulatory data, the Constitutional Court with judgment No 221 of 2015 in the matter of judicial correction of the attribution of sex affirmed that the right to gender identity is a constituent element of the right to personal identity, fully falling within the scope of the fundamental rights of the person. In the same sense, the Court expresses itself in judgment n° 180 of 2017, in which it reiterates that it must once again be noted that the aspiration of the individual to the correspondence of sex attributed to him in the personal registers at the time of birth with that subjectively perceived and lived is certainly an expression of the right to recognition of gender identity. <p> 12 p.m. (Follows MARILOTTI). How did the judge of the laws get to all this? With the usual field invasion of jurisdiction against Parliament? Doesn\\'t look like it. The Courts say this starting from the word \"genere\" which is already present in the various laws and decrees in force for several years in our order, such as the electoral law for the House and Decree-Law No. 93 of 2013. Nothing easier, therefore, than that the word \"genere\" is accepted in the mediation to which Senator Salvini mentioned, without his colleague Pillon beating an eye, and a consistent jurisprudence in a few years comes to apply the law of Mancino also to gender identity. Why, then, so loud? Isn\\'t it that on whether or not to send the measure back to the House you are by chance playing games, muscle-type tests within the majority? To conclude, I am absolutely convinced that the Zan bill is a measure of civilization, which helps us to live in an inclusive, tolerant, respectful society of the rights of all, beyond and beyond the identity groups that make up our diverse society.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5146409869194031, 0.4853590428829193]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, unfortunately, the desired change of pace announced on several occasions by this Government has not taken place and has not taken place in practice. <p> I can only judge insufficient the answers given by this decree-law support, which pair both with restrictive measures and with the reopening claudicants that have put and threaten the survival of many companies. <p> It is not rational to argue that one can save a company by giving it only aid that usually corresponds to a percentage ranging from 2% to 5% of the decrease in turnover. <p> As Brothers of Italy for months we insist that the only way to help and support companies is to intervene on fixed costs. One of the important instruments, perhaps the only one that had carried this Government well, was linked to the 110% superbonus. It is certainly an important tool that serves to help and can be a flywheel for our national economy, as well as being a strategic tool to achieve the goals of urban regeneration. It is therefore an instrument that must not be lost at all, but it is an opportunity that must be taken. <p> As I said earlier, it must be a flywheel for the national economy, so much so that we have seen in recent months how this instrument has led to an increase, week after week. Let us take a few examples: on 19 March, there were some 6,500 interventions amounting to 733 million euros and, only after ten days, we have reached an increase of almost 40%, moving to 9,207 interventions, worth more than one billion. Therefore, the superbonus would certainly be an anti-cyclical measure. <p> Brothers of Italy has always considered that, in order to revive the economy, and above all to support companies, it was necessary to stimulate consumption and also production. This is the logic behind the superbonus too; but in order to achieve this, two elements are essential: the first is the extension. An extension to 2023 is essential because the deadline is in June 2022, and this would certainly discourage all those who want to draw. The other important element to be able to follow up the superbonus is certainly linked to bureaucracy and simplification. <p> In this case too, the Government announced, a few weeks ago, the decree-law simplifications; therefore, it would be important for the superbonus to be part of this logic of simplification. <p> Only from a verbal point of view has there been a commitment from Prime Minister Draghi both as regards the extension and as regards the issue of simplification. An important aspect is to extend the audience also to accommodation facilities, hotels, but an effect related to the superbonus concerns the development of raw materials since the works are increasing, so you have to monitor to avoid speculation. <p> In short, Mr President, in conclusion, this is a government that does the opposite of what it would be right to do, i.e. it does not confirm the only bonus that should have been confirmed, that of 11%. Instead, it has given rainy bonuses and denies the financing of the only bonus that, as I said, would be able to guarantee development and growth. So the government walks backwards, like a shrimp, and risks crashing. What interests us and worries us, however, is that it might be the Italians who go to battle. We of Brothers of Italy will not allow it and we will be vigilant, so that this bonus can actually be realized, because it is fundamental, precisely in order to create a flywheel that serves all companies, in the field of construction, which represent a backbone of our economy. So we will be vigilant, so that these words can be carried out in concrete acts. <p> I call on my colleagues to remain within the allotted time frame.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6846882700920105, 0.3153117895126343]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote in dissent from the Group. <p> TOCCI (<PARTY>).

Many colleagues have only made dissent with the secret vote; it is a pity that they have not expressed it in the light of the sun. On the other hand, those who criticized in a transparent and loyal manner have been treated with personal insults. When it comes to the Constitution, it is the quality of the debate that largely decides the outcome. It had never happened, in republican history, that the Head of Government imposed a sort of vote of confidence on the change of the Charter. He promised to cut the costs of politics, but he decided not to reduce the number of Members and this failure created an imbalance. The House becomes six times larger than the Senate and allows those who win the election to use the majority prize to take over the Quirinale. Let us be honest: if Berlusconi had modified the Constitution by weakening the independence of the Presidency of the Republic, we would have filled the streets. <p> Over the past twenty years, not only on the right, but also on the left, the executive power has been strengthened to the detriment of the legislative. Yet the second Republic had not finished the work; it took a new man to implement the program of the old political class. The Italian crisis is not institutional, it is political and depends on the lack of clear and distinct projects. The right did not realize the liberalism that he had promised and the left did not counter inequalities as it was up to her to do. The two poles have asked for more powers of government, without knowing what to do with it. All this has produced many laws, but no real reform. The void is filled with media illusions.

A few days ago, a social cooperative asked Mortara football to be able to use the Mortara stadium free of charge. The request that was made at Mortara football was also motivated by pressure from the prefecture. As a result, Mortara football, in front of the word \"prefecture\" has pulled back and granted, mistakenly, the use of the stadium of Mortara, in order to be able to do the training and carry out the activities, to a football team or such made by illegal migrants, people who at this moment do not have Italian citizenship. <p> MIRABELLI (<PARTY>). They\\'re asylum seekers! PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. Migrants are fine; asylum seekers and illegal immigrants know that they do not match. CENTINAIO (<PARTY>)... Migrants, illegal immigrants, asylum seekers... use the term you want but for me they are not Italian. Too bad that exists in Mortara, as in all the other municipalities of Italy, a convention that binds the relations between the football team and the municipality. As a result, the Municipality grants annually - there is this special convention - the use of the structure of the Mortara stadium to the team in order to be able to play the youth championships and championships to which Mortara football is registered. Among other things, the parents of the children who play on the Mortara team pay an annual tuition to send their children. The mayor Facchinotti, when he learns - not from the Mortara football team or the Faber cooperative, but from the local newspaper - the constitution of this team and that the same will use, without being authorized, the Morara stadium, immediately summons the Mortara football and communicates the impossibility, by Mortara, since this convention exists, to use the stadium to play the people we talked about before. I don\\'t see anything wrong with that, President. A mayor enforces the law, a convention. <p> There\\'s nothing wrong with it, nothing illegal, nothing racist. Mayor Facchinotti had a convention respected, so he did his duty as mayor, as all the mayors of Italy should do, from Bolzano to Lampedusa. <p> What happened was absurd because, at a time when Mayor Facchinotti declared, among other things, that he did not know who these people are and not even what they are doing, he was absolutely right because a few days before - and whoever lives in the province of Pavia knows - in the local newspaper, Mr. Garavaglia, president of the Faber cooperative, declared that only five percent of his guests would obtain refugee status and that the others were illegal (words quoted by Mr. Garavaglia, and not by Gian Marco Centinario or the Province of Pavese). So Mr. Facchinotti, Mayor of Mortara, simply enforces the law. The end of the world is unleashed by those who do not know that there are laws to be enforced (alas for them); a hallucinating ending that some fellow senators present a parliamentary question to the Minister, including those who laughed before. The question asks the Minister why the use of the field has been revoked. Well, the use of the field has never been revoked - let people know before they speak - rather it has never been authorized. Then we talk about a clearly discriminatory and racist decision. Then, this attack on the part of those who make politics towards a mayor who does his work I send him back, also because generally when a mayor of my party makes a chapel - I say the word, President - I am the first to say and to recognize that you can also make a mistake, but in this case Mr. Facchinotti, mayor of Mortara, is everything except a discriminatory and racist person. I think that the colleagues of the Democratic Party, so talkative in television broadcasts, should be informed before talking about this person, because Mr. Facchinotti, mayor of Mortara, former city council member of the culture of the Province of Pavia, is a mild man, a person of culture not only appreciated by the militants of the League and its citizens but also by those militants of the Democratic Party who at this moment tore their clothes to go after news and above all that they should have informed the senators, who so much say and so much do but do not know Mr. Facchinotti.

Synthetically nicknamed save Rome 3, in fact it contains numerous measures concerning the local authorities and the regions that are waiting for them. It is no longer the same text as the so-called provisions save Rome 1 and 2; it has been greatly improved by the whole discussion that has taken place in recent months. <p> In advance, it is noted that the measure is provided with the updated technical report, pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8, of the Law of Accounting and Public Finance. With regard to the profiles of interest of the 5th Commission, Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Decree-Law provides for the coverage of the increase of the State contribution to the Municipalities, through the reduction of 118,156 million euros of the Fund for urgent and indifferent needs and 6,844 million euros of the Fund for structural interventions of economic policy. <p> Article 2-a refers to the postponement of the deadline for the resolution of the forecast balance sheet for the 2014 financial year of local authorities, from 30 April 2014 to 31 July 2014. Allow me to make a statement to the budget: the extension is necessary for our fault, because the state does not provide in good time all the information necessary for local authorities to adopt the budget. Let us remember that it is a duty, but it is also a right of the municipalities to be able to express their budgets and to be able to work in an orderly manner within their communities. Article 3 contains a number of amendments to the single text of the local authorities, with a view to giving greater flexibility to the multiannual financial rebalancing procedure for local authorities: a new plan is accepted, including as a result of the refusal by the municipal council or the Court of Auditors; the time when the local authority can use the procedure for rebalancing is extended; the activation of loans beyond the existing limits is permitted; plans can be re-modulated in some cases. In addition, for municipalities with more than 20,000 inhabitants planning a reduction of at least 20% in service costs and the rationalisation of participating companies, they are allowed to achieve a balance within a maximum period of three years. Finally, the possibility for subsidiaries to apply mobility processes between companies is widened, eliminating the constraint of consistency with their professional system. (Brusio). PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed. Senator Romani, I invite you to lower your voice. ZANONI, rapporteur. Thank you, Madam President. Article 3-a reduces the minimum amount of the local government credit devaluation Fund and the amount of the local government credit write-down Fund for liquidity advances granted for the payment of past dues by these institutions, from 25% to 20% and 30% to 20% respectively of the assets remaining under Titles I and III of the entry, which are over five years old. This is a measure strongly awaited by local authorities, which have great difficulty in implementing this rule in a short time, especially with regard to very large authorities. Article 4 provides for a specific procedure for the gradual absorption of the sums allocated to the staff of the regions and local authorities in breach of the financial constraints imposed on supplementary collective bargaining. Paragraphs 3-a to 3-c allow the payment by regions and local authorities of the benefits of workers who are socially useful for the remuneration earned during the period 2010-2013, in compliance with the Internal Stability Pact and, in any case, ensuring the safeguarding of budgetary balances. Article 5 allows local authorities, for the years 2014 and 2015, to take on new loans and access to other forms of financing available on the market, beyond the limits of 8% of the revenue set by the single text of local authorities for an amount not exceeding the capital shares of loans and bonds previously contracted, repaid in the previous year. This is a very long-awaited measure, also in order to trigger again the lever of development in communities. Article 7 introduces provisions for the verification of IMU revenue for the year 2013. Given that of course the 2013 budgets are already closed, I would ask the Government to pay attention to the modalities of application. Article 8 provides for the provision of an advance of 20 percent of what is due for the year 2014 as a municipal solidarity fund to the municipalities of the Sicilian Region and the Region of Sardinia. Article 9 reduces, as from 2014, the ordinary contribution to local authorities by EUR 7 million for the Provinces and EUR 118 million for the Municipalities. Article 10 confirms, for the year 2014, the modalities of repartition to the Provinces of the Experimental Rebalancing Fund, already adopted by ministerial decree of 4 May 2012. Reductions in resources for the revision of expenditure and transfers to the Sicilian and Sardinian provinces are also confirmed. Article 11 amends the rules of the provincial and municipal end-of-term report in order to simplify its drafting and publication procedure. Let me say something about this: the end-of-term report is an important instrument of transparency; making it more simplified probably facilitates the municipalities in its drafting, which, moreover, seems very important for the sake of political and administrative transparency. The article 12, paragraph 1, intervenes on the beginning of the delivery of the extraordinary contribution for the mergers of Municipalities; to the paragraph l- bis allocates to the Regione Emilia-Romagna the sums entered in residual account for the year 2014 on the fund destined to the supply of contributions to the natural persons for the reduction of the price of gasoline and diesel for automotive to the pump, which extraordinary contribution pairs to 2 million euros. Article 13 provides that the financing allocated to the Municipality of Lampedusa and Linosa from the Development Fund of the smaller islands, for the year 2008 and 2009, is entirely paid out and intended for the realization of urgent interventions of the Municipality related to the reception of refugees and the primary needs of the island community. Article 14 deals with the discipline of the Municipal Solidarity Fund, establishing that 10% of the Fund under consideration is distributed among the municipalities on the basis of standard requirements, specifying that tax capacities must also be taken into account. This is also an important provision, reflecting the work done by the Bicameral Commission on fiscal federalism on the definition of standard needs and costs. Article 15, paragraph 1, clarifies that, for the Provinces that in 2009 were affected by the break-up of newly established Provinces, the objective of the Internal Stability Pact is calculated by assuming the current expenditure of the two-year period 2010-2011, instead of the three-year period 2009-2011; in paragraph l-a it provides for an mitigation of sanctions for the Provinces that have not complied with the Stability Pact. Article 16 contains provisions on Roma Capitale. I believe that a fair balance has been struck between the need to help and support the Municipality of Rome to overcome the budgetary difficulties and the necessary assumption of responsibility by the Municipality itself with a three-year plan which provides for the reduction of the deficit and the structural rebalancing of the budget, waste management measures, subsidiaries and subsidiaries, tax and tariff evasion. In fact, it is expected that by 4 July 2014 the Municipality will send a report highlighting the causes of the deficit formation and adopt a three-year plan for the reduction of the deficit and for the structural rebalancing of the budget, which must be approved by decree of the President of the Council of Ministers. It also authorizes the extraordinary commissioner of the Government for the Municipality of Rome to insert, in the passive mass of the debt of the Municipality of Rome, additional debits for a total of 115 million euros. Finally, the finalization of resources, amounting to 12 million euros in 2014 and 10,5 million euros in 2015, is expected to ensure the implementation of planned interventions to overcome the ongoing crisis in waste management in the territory of Rome, after validation by the Ministry of the environment of the three-year work programme on separate collection. Article 17 provides for the payment, by the State, to Trenitalia of the amount of 13,4 million euros for consideration of the services rendered in the first seven months of 2014 in Valle d'Aosta. Article 18 refers, to paragraph 1, provisions aimed at limiting, in the year 2014, the application of certain sanctions provided for in the current legislation for the failure to comply with the Stability Pact against the Municipalities of Venice and Chioggia. The paragraph l-a contains a rule of authentic interpretation of paragraph 76 of Article 1 of Law No 311 of 2004, concerning the arrangements for the inclusion in the balance sheet of debt and income deriving from loans. Article 19 extends to 31 March 2014 (instead of 28 February 2014 originally planned) the deadline set by the 2014 Stability Act for the continuation of contracts concluded by state educational and educational institutions for the purchase of cleaning services and other auxiliary services. The paragraph l- bis previews that the resources destined from article 18, paragraph 8-a, of the decree-law n. 69 of 2013 to the safety of the school buildings, pairs to 3,5 million euros for each of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, are also aimed to guarantee the continuation of the activities of monitoring of the seismic risk. It is also envisaged that the implementing decree should no longer identify the institutions to be entrusted with the above activities. Article 20 provides for financial facilities in favour of the Province and the Municipality of L'Aquila, as well as the other municipalities of the crater, affected by the earthquake of April 2009. Article 20-a allocates a share of the resources of the Development and Cohesion Fund, amounting to EUR 50 million, which will be made available as a result of the verification of the actual state of implementation of the actions foreseen under the 2007-2013 programming, to the financing of the National Emergency Fund. For all that said, and with the awareness that the measure has taken into account the debate and the observations that the Senate expressed in the discussions on the so-called provisions save Rome 1 and 2, I believe that this measure is necessary and urgent for the local authorities, the Regions and for the country and that it must be voted in its entirety.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6167868971824646, 0.3832131326198578]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> LAI (<PARTY>). Mr President, I was encouraged by Mr Sonego to speak on this issue. I very much share what he has emphasized is a concern, in the sense that we obviously agree on the necessity to revise with a delegation to the Government all the norms that concern the matter of the fiscal incentives, social security and contribution of the marine enterprises, but that paragraph b), besides to have doubts of legitimacy, regarding us, intervenes on a state of the market of the transports that is already well configured. In fact, there is a duopoly over which, with such a rule, Parliament would choose one of the two parties in a clear way and without going through the competent Commission. I say more. I have been told that this rule would promote maritime continuity in Sardinia. In this regard I note that maritime continuity in Sardinia did not work with a single subject; today it begins to be a more competitive system because there are at least two subjects competing. It would be good to favour them even more, also because the prices to connect to Sardinia during the tourist season or for the transport of goods continue to be rather high, and would certainly not be favored by the fact that one of the two subjects of the current duopoly is privileged. The proposal that I feel like making to the Government is therefore that letter (b) be withdrawn or voted separately. The amendment can be maintained as a system of delegation, without point (b). Otherwise, if not, after hearing the debate in the Budget Committee over the past few weeks and the opinion of many colleagues, one abstention vote would be the minimum in the face of the maintenance of the amending proposal in its current wording.

Madam President, it is with conviction that the Group for the Autonomies (SVP, UV, PATT, UPT)-PSI-MAIE will vote in favour of the motion for a resolution No 5 tabled by the majority, which approves the Economic and Financial Document. This conviction is supported by the presence of a macroeconomic framework that is finally more favourable, which has been extensively illustrated by the rapporteur and Deputy Minister Morando. It is a confirmation that the measures taken in the last period are giving the expected results and that it is possible to seize some opportunities to promote real growth. To be clear, with these statements we do not hide the problems that still prevent our economy from starting a sustained phase of growth, but rather we want to reiterate and share what is contained in the premise to the DEF that we have left behind a dramatic situation, an economy in recession and that we are ready to restart, to change gear, so that in order to talk about real economic recovery, growth, recovery and competitiveness we need to wait for the effects that will actually produce the reforms put in place by the Government and those in the process of implementation. These are important reforms on which not only the Government, but also the entire Parliament, in our opinion, are playing their credibility at national and European level. It will be the implementation of these reforms that, by renewing our institutional, administrative, social and fiscal framework, will create the conditions for greater flexibility, as provided for in the 1997 regulation and not the other day. Finally, we are dealing with a Commission that can interpret in a more intelligent way the rules that we have given ourselves since entering the euro. This is an opportunity not to be missed if we want the word \"growth\" to appear in the next DEF in full title. The new direction of the European Commission offers additional opportunities for increasing employment by opting for a choice that is a break from the past and that has seen only one policy: austerity policy. The three guidelines on which the Commission\\'s programme is based (tax responsibility, investment policy and structural reforms) represent an important occasion for our country too and above all. In this context, the initiatives contained in the Juncker Plan, which ultimately led to the establishment of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, as well as the so-called quantitative easing, initiated by Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank, should be taken into account. If we move in the wake of the Commission and the European Central Bank itself, which also makes various instruments available to us in the real economy, and implement the programme of reforms identified by the Government, we will be able to speed up the process of growth effectively and above all with a relapse into the economy of people, families and businesses. As reported by an important rating agency, the economic potential of our country is high and our rating could improve if the prospects supported and induced by the ongoing reform process recorded a real strengthening of the real economy. But in order to give solidity and perspective to growth, in addition to the called structural reforms, as is also noted in the DEF, we believe it is important to relaunch, above all, public and private investment, a fundamental step in stimulating domestic aggregate demand. In order to make a change and make a stable and substantial contribution, however, we should grow by 3% of GDP, as some say, and this is the challenge we face in the coming years. However, we also have at our disposal EUR 13.6 billion, which can be used, as the new Minister of Infrastructure said, by starting new investments or by renewing and realising those planned. In this regard, I would like to mention in particular the multimodal corridors and above all - with regard to a work that is very dear to our territory and which has been reiterated in the law of stability - the continuation of the Brenner tunnel and its access routes. This will be crucial to linking the North and the South of Europe: thanks to these infrastructures we can grow and restore prospects for the economy. So let us consider this as a transitional period, in which the measures approved so far have not yet been fully implemented: I am thinking in particular of some of the measures contained in the Stability Act for 2015 and we hope that they will be extended to the following years, such as the decontribution for companies taking on permanent employment and the elimination of labour costs from the IRAP tax base, which, together with the current regulations contained in the jobs act, are beginning to bear fruit; just read today\\'s news agencies. There is no doubt that the loss of precarious employment will also have a positive impact on investment, in particular on the construction sector and on the real estate market, which will greatly help this fundamental sector of the national economy. It will be especially important that the implementation decrees of the jobs act are issued according to the timetable set out in the national reform programme and it will be equally important that we do not remain imprisoned for too long in the links of a certain bureaucracy. I am not referring to all the bureaucracy, but certainly to a certain bureaucracy, which is often synonymous with impediment. That is why we believe it is essential, indeed strategic, to approve as soon as possible the reform of the public administration, which in our opinion will allow us to cut unnecessary snares and snares and, above all, to intervene on the so-called unnecessary and unproductive expenditures. To give certainty in the procedures and in the times means to offer the necessary guarantees to all those who intend to invest in our country. A more efficient public administration at the real service of businesses and citizens will be the backbone of the new country system. For the same reasons, we believe that the structural reforms already undertaken and the new initiatives, which will also have an impact on debt growth and sustainability, are necessary. I refer in particular to those concerning civil justice and the so-called fiscal delegation, which will be strategic, as it will be definitively declined by the Ministry. Finally, I would also like to mention the so-called treasure, which is expected to be due to the better performance of GDP. In these days we have heard a number of proposals, some of which are very imaginative and which have also been discussed during the hearings that have taken place in these days in the Commissions. That is why we have listened very carefully to the real intentions of the Government regarding its use. The Minister\\'s statements, today reiterated by the Deputy Minister, have given the precise indication that it will be used for measures with temporary budgetary effects, in line with the reform process. We consider it reasonable and believe that this means better defining it with consistent and flexible choices, which should consolidate the recovery. Therefore, in our opinion, these resources could be channelled towards productive activities that can help expanding sectors: I am referring, in particular, to investment in so-called broadband, to strategic sectors such as agriculture in the year of the Expo, perhaps providing for a greater extension of the IMU exemption, I am also referring to the idea of banking suffering, through state aid, according to the possibilities allowed by European regulations, since our system was not financed at the beginning of the crisis of the banks and at this time such intervention could be useful to restart credit policies. Of course, these are measures which, at this point, will facilitate recovery. Finally, let me mention something that is particularly important to us and that is also reiterated in the DEF: I am referring to the question of finally making a real contrast to the phenomenon of tax evasion and avoidance. In fact, the measures put in place to date by the Government and those foreseen in the delegation are aimed at creating a fairer, more transparent, simplified and oriented system, precisely, to growth. Of course, there are still a few pieces missing to complete it, but we want an acceleration of the path aimed at obtaining, finally, a system characterized by certainty, stability, reduction and simplification of tax obligations. We therefore consider these three reforms and these three elements to be essential, namely the tax system, the labour system and the civil justice system. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed.

Madam President, in working on this reflection and this remembrance, I have come back to the passages of our history which we, too, sometimes risk forgetting here. He recalls Gaetano Arfè, in an essay on the Italian Historical Review, that Piero Gobetti dedicates to Giacomo Matteotti even a number of his great magazine \"Liberal Revolution\" on July 1, 1924, just twenty days away from the crime. The profile of Matteotti written by Gobetti himself outlined for the occasion a picture of reformist socialism, mutualizing many reasons for the controversy between Salvemini and Gramsci. Gobetti wrote: \"He (Matteotti) was the only Italian socialist (preceded by Gaetano Salvemini) for whom reformism was not synonymous with opportunism.\" The essay of Arfé bears this title: \"Giacomo Matteotti man and politician.\" It is in this synthesis of humanity and politics that I believe this figure should be brought back to memory: the first symbolic martyr of anti-fascistism, but also political of race, who makes a very young choice of life of practical commitment to the living and working conditions of the popular classes. When Matteotti was born, he exploded in his lands, the Polesine, that movement of just, even if of exasperated protest that will go under the name, and the cry, \"La boje!\" He always remained passionately in this tradition, which is precisely the history of that socialist reformism, intransigent and radical, even in its gradualism, whose social base was located in the countryside of the Valle Padana. It has been said that, as for Gramsci the first reference will be the industrial proletariat, for Matteotti it was that exploited and yet dignified proletariat, politically advanced in its forms of struggle and organization. What for Gramsci were the factory councils, for Matteotti were the municipalities and the leagues. As an expert local administrator he came to propose a consortium of municipalities: our Soviets, he will call them at the Congress of Bologna of the Socialist Party. And he saw in the Padan countryside as a great city: the city spread, not urbanly, as it is said today, but socially. His feet as a agitator and a scholar were always planted on this fertile ground. He deals with agricultural agreements, schools, roads, phones. Luigi Einaudi, with whom Matteotti had fierce controversy, paid posthumous homage to his financial skills, to the scientific dress with which he faced the problems, far from the facery and demagogy. Matteotti, strongly opposed to the war, as has been mentioned here, and severely controversial with the representatives, even socialists, of democratic interventionism, was among the first to appreciate Keynes\\' brilliant writings on the economic consequences of peace and the criticism of the devastating sanctions imposed on Germany defeated. It was recalled that in 1919 he was elected a Member of Parliament. In October 1922, following the further split of the party, after that of Livorno, he was elected secretary of the United Socialist Party. A few days earlier, in the newspaper \"La Lotta\" of Rovigo had written: I am ashamed that our congresses devote all their time to these diatribes; that we think of nothing but divisions. The proletariat must be united: one block, even under the storm. Already in March 1921, in the course of a bitter trade union struggle in Polesine, he was attacked. It is loaded on a cart by the fascists, beaten, threatened with death, abandoned in the open countryside. On June 10, 1924, the fatal ambush, kidnapping and murder. Two years earlier, in 1922, the same fate had come to Walther Rathenau, the exceptional political and intellectual, then foreign minister, by a group of German nationalists and revancists. It is against these figures, you see from us Aldo Moro, that the most fanatical barbarism is always fierce. In the end, these are the most dangerous personalities. Political violence belongs to the weak, not to the strong. Those who fail to fight their opponent with the weapons of criticism, resort to the criticism of weapons. This is what great totalitarianisms have done, and this is what small terrors have done. In June 1985, on the centenary of the birth of Matteotti\\'s death and on the nineteenth anniversary of the death of Matteotti - I take this quotation from a very documented monograph on Giuseppe Saragat, by our colleague Senator Fornaro - Saragat, called to hold the official commemoration in the presence of the President of the Republic Sandro Pertini, makes an interesting notation: Matteotti\\'s reformism is an attitude of seriousness in the face of problems that are not resolved with the conati of pseudorevolutionary amateurism or with the violence of fanatics, but with a conscious and creative action. Matteotti, in his brief intense existence, was deeply concerned with that \"reformism to the test,\" which is the title of an article by Filippo Turati on social criticism, not by chance at the time when the long Ministry Giolitti opened. Giacomo Matteotti is a vaccine against the possible disease of reformism. Arfé concluded his essay by recalling the intuition, which immediately spread then, that he had voluntarily gone to death or that he had waited for it, without looking for it, but without stepping back. And remember that Claudio Treves was the first to greet him as a martyr, that Piero Gobetti called him \"The volunteer of death,\" that Ernesto Bonaiuti challenges him: \"Do you go in search of the face of God?\" Carlo Rosselli wrote to Nenni: You spoke to me once and so that I was moved by Matteotti. I too have often dreamed that I could end my life so usefully. And we know he\\'s gonna do it. He concluded the essay: \"They are testimonies of men, among the highest consciences of Italy of the time\" (). And, it would be bitter to say, of a time. Dear Madam President, Senators and Senators, we have the duty, the ethical obligation, to convey to the new generations the example of these people, who have made the vocation to politics noble. It is not enough for the judicial tribunal, it is before the court of this history that they are and must be summoned, so that they may come to be ashamed of themselves, they are still able to do so, all the corrupt and corrupt who infest, with their plague, our Republic.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5396847724914551, 0.4603152573108673]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, distinguished colleagues, today we are not just going to decide on the future of an entire territory, but we are going to write a new page in Italian institutional history. With the approval of the amendments to the Statute of the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia we are operating an epochal change within the Italian institutional structure. The process of reform that is now investing my Region could, in a very short time, manifest itself also in the rest of the country, therefore I assert without any difficulty that, at this historical moment, Friuli-Venezia Giulia is a precursor of the times. With the removal of the Provinces from the Statute, the Region is putting itself at the vanguard in the Italian institutional reorganization, especially if it is considered that, with the definitive realization of the reform of Title V of the Constitution, the Provinces will no longer be previewed also in the rest of the Country. <p> It must be pointed out that in Friuli-Venezia Giulia the Provinces have already begun to overcome, with a reform of the local authorities that respects the constitutional principles of subsidiarity, adequacy and efficiency. This reform will lead to a new organisation of the regional institutional structure and the improvement of services provided to citizens. It is therefore a complex process, which will lead to an integrated system based on two pillars: the Region and the Municipalities. The Intercommunal Territorial Unions, which are born from this reform, are the direct emanations of the Municipalities - this must be emphasized in particular - that are in the process of carrying out an overall reassignment of the administrative functions in the Region. These Unions will exercise in an associated form municipal and large-area functions, both provincial and regional, thus giving rise to a new form of government of the territory, able to work more efficiently in favor of the citizen. The municipalities will thus be required to work together, generating a whole range of positive processes, including the exchange of good practices and the specialization of services. <p> What the Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia has done with the remodelling of its institutional architecture and the consequent rationalization of the local autonomy is in fact one of the maximum expressions of use of its specialty. Friuli-Venezia Giulia is therefore demonstrating a serious, determined and coherent autonomy, exercising its skills to lead to an efficiency of services and better management of public money. Friuli-Venezia Giulia is therefore an important vanguard of a change capable of improving the quality of life of the resident population. The text that we are going to vote also provides for the possibility of establishing, as has been said, metropolitan cities in the territory of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. It should be remembered that this amending intervention has been much debated and also criticized by the political forces in the Council of the aforementioned Region and I myself find it rather forced, also because the Region has already begun a process of profound change that will lead the Municipalities to work together. The Metropolitan City would therefore run the risk of overlapping with the already established Intercommunal Territorial Unions. It should be stressed, however, that there is no obligation to establish the Metropolitan City and that, under the legislative power in the area of local authorities, the discipline in this area is entrusted to the Region. <p> Well, then, but we can't afford the luxury of wasting more time. Friuli-Venezia Giulia must be able to reason with serenity on its own future and carry out a reform, which will make the organization of its local services more modern and efficient. It is time for courageous choices, such as those made by us. <p> What we are prepared to approve is a good law and it is the autonomous region itself that has asked to approve it as soon as possible. I therefore call on my colleagues to get rid of the delay and I am in favour of this bill, which will enable an entire territory to grow, progress and develop.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7177852988243103, 0.2822147011756897]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> MOLES (<PARTY>). Mr President, I thank the Government, in the person of the Undersecretary, and I am partially satisfied (I will also explain why).

I am partially satisfied, because in the conclusion of its reply the Ministry ensures a high level of attention. This is what we actually need; this is what we wanted to have as an answer to our question, because I stress with great bitterness that this is a story that has been going on for many years. Many were the solicitations, many were the initiatives of the communities and institutions; many were the reports of the same companies that orbit in that area. The perception - which is not only a perception, but a certainty - is that Basilicata is almost a trash can; and these are not the only cases of environmental pollution, as we know well. No response in these years has come from the agencies in charge and from the Basilicata Region. Why? Perhaps because with this bounce of skills you wanted to cover a number of shortcomings? Perhaps because the Basilicata Region, having no more landfills available, did not know where to take the waste? To conclude, what I ask the Government is to maintain the commitment it has made towards the conclusion of its response, because we can clearly no longer trust and we can no longer believe absolutely reliable, neither credible, the controls, acts and initiatives of the local authorities and of a Basilicata Region that has been ruled irresponsiblely by the center-left. There have been many initiatives that have not been answered. Only recently, thanks to the intervention of the judiciary and the NOE, has an answer been given.

And, as long as it is necessary, we will remind Parliament and our country of the urgent need to stem violence against women. There are five feminicides that we have to deal with today. Two similar episodes took place last week. On March 9, in Gambellara, in the province of Vicenza, Vanna Meggiolaro, fifty years old, was killed by her husband, who had denounced for ill-treatment and from whom she was separating. As he had repeatedly threatened to do, her husband, with her aboard, threw himself at a TIR killing her and was in turn killed. In the same way, a few days later, on March 12, in Pordenone, Jamir Temjenlemla, thirty-seven years old, was killed by her former companion, who also died in the clash he caused with a TIR, which this time also caused the death of the driver of the vehicle. Again, the episode takes place after a series of threats and ill-treatment for which the woman had denounced him. In the night between 17 and 18 March in Orte, in the province of Viterbo, Silvia Tabacchi, a 28-year-old woman, was shot dead by the former boyfriend, from whom she had recently separated, who then killed herself. On 10 March, Xiang Lei Li's husband, 36 years old, was arrested on charges of killing his wife in Genoa during a cruise. The woman's husband was about to return home, to Ireland, with the two children aged five and seven. Of particular heinousness was then the killing, on March 8, in Cirò Marina, in the province of Crotone, Antonella Lettieri, forty-two years old, which was ferociously murdered with 12 stabbed and as many hammered by a man who knew and who was part of his network of closer relationships. This increases to 45 women we remember in this relay, which began only on June 30, 2016. We propose with conviction our appeal; an appeal to the Government all and to the Undersecretary with delegation to equal opportunities: the directing booth monitors the application, the merits and the limits of law no. 119 of 2013 and give full and accurate implementation to the plan against violence. We must intervene in the environment of training and education of each person; the school and the family are the educational communities that accompany the growth of each.

According to data provided by Save the children in fact, two thirds of our kids believe that cyberbullying is the main threat in their lives. <p> An important measure, therefore, for which I thank Senator Ferrara, not only for the topic she addresses, but also for how she addresses it. <p> I would like to highlight two aspects. Firstly, that the measure is based on prevention by placing at the centre the training of school staff, of all school staff. This makes a big difference because cyberbullying in schools has already intervened but it has always been about projects that were born and then died. Founding prevention on the training of staff means choosing an effective and lasting way because training teachers in close collaboration with families and local institutions means that conscious education on the network will be a permanent activity, it will become a sort of DNA of school education. <p> Moreover, with regard to the method, the definition of an integrated action plan, also through the establishment at national level of a technical table composed of various ministries and projected (as stated in the guidelines of the Ministry of Education) at local level is an absolutely important choice. <p> I repeat the importance of the measure here also in response to the too many, ingenious criticisms that are read on the media, but above all on the web that have emphasized the uselessness of the bill declaring it, sometimes, also inappropriate. Those who have supported and still support this thesis have founded this opinion on the idea that the only things that serve against cyberbullying would be self-regulation initiatives that, among other things, are also on the run at European and international level and to which have already joined most of the managers of the big social networks platforms: from Google to Facebook, moving from Microsoft and Apple. They support, in short, these people that are essential, direct and sufficient is the commitment of managers through the adoption of reporting and control mechanisms. And how can we not agree with the recognition of this path of responsibility for social networks? It is important and it will certainly have to progress further, but with as much clarity I say that this is not enough, it is not enough. A law is necessary, this bill absolutely not based on sanctioning attitudes because it is a measure that does not criminalize the web: it is a bill based on prevention, on the cultural promotion of the conscious use of the network. It is a bill that in promoting the correct use of the network has something fundamental, because it puts individual and collective responsibility at the centre. It is not a measure based on coercive and punitive proposals, but on the promotion of a civic culture based on respect for itself and for others. Respect for oneself and for others: these are the words that dress the clothes of prevention and education, because without these words education and prevention would be empty words. That is the important challenge. Education to the conscious use of the network is not, will not be and must not be alone and only the implementation of a knowledge, a technique to defend or to defend children, but must carry out an equally important action. Obviously, it is necessary to know also the techniques, but just as important is the activation of an educational process of citizenship, to increase that awareness of the inseparable existence of rights and responsibilities, of the inseparable respect that everyone claims for himself and that must correspond to respect for others. It will have to be, and will be, a path that will help and support the construction of individual and collective identities stronger and less fragile, helping children to be able to respect those who, instead, are all too often lived as different today. Most of the episodes of bullying and cyberbullying are directed towards young homosexuals, disabled people and immigrants. And here I add nothing else, because I fully share the intervention of Senator Lo Giudice. I spoke of self-respect and respect for others, but why did I do it? I did it because we must not forget that two are the subjects damaged by cyberbullying. Certainly, in the first place and in a dramatic way, those who suffer it. People who in a short time see their reputation and image damaged, and in a very large community. The contents, in fact, once published, still today can reappear, on several occasions and in different places (I remember that two thirds of the children consider cyberbullying the main threat to their lives), and all this makes the victims insecure in all areas and moments of their lives. But I believe that even those who do it are the victims of cyberbullying, because violent, evil and bullying are not born. The explanation is that what you met, or did not meet, in your life has made us somehow fragile compared to the risk of activating such violent behaviors. If those terrible acts are carried out at twelve, thirteen, fourteen or fifteen years old, we should first of all ask ourselves why this happens. If, in fact, it is true that the anonymity of the Network pushes to carry out gestures that it would be difficult to carry out in other places and other spaces of life, it is also true that more and more, in the published videos, are well visible, not only the abused subjects, but also the authors, who exhibit, almost as a muscular test, their anger, their aggression, their own contempt for those who are mistreated and represented as weak and different. So there\\'s something going on, and we should think about it. For this reason, too, I stress the importance of the proposal for a law placing the subject of school at the centre. European research also confirms that it is the school where more than 90% of bullying takes place. While I stress the importance of school, however, I also say that we have a duty not to delegate this issue to the children alone, to the schools alone and to the families who, moreover, must be helped to act together. This issue, in fact, calls in the first place, as many other colleagues, we adults, have said. It is we adults, not only as parents but the world of adults in general, who are responsible. We all grow and build our identity, not on the basis of the words we are told or the \"pistolotti\" that we receive in the family, but for the examples and situations, those that we live in the home but above all those that we see outside. We must reason on our responsibility and on what are, individually and collectively, the examples we live on in our daily lives. And I can think of the episode of these days, about the people killed because they are unable to live in that difficult climate of relationship within the condominiums. But what image do we give of the ability to weave relationships based on respect for oneself and for others? I\\'m deeply concerned about cyberbullying, but I\\'m also concerned about adult behavior. To give examples, I think of that group of parents who have all rebelled against the principal who suspended for four days the students of a class who had used a really terrible violence against a classmate on a school trip, during one of those nights when you get drunk, then posting the video of such violence on the web. Those parents, once they were called by the principal and became aware that their son had performed those acts, became angry with the principal and said that she was a girl and were concerned not that her children were capable of this violence but only that the suspension could harm the outcome of the school year. I say this also by referring to a survey developed in 2004 within the European anti-bullying network which concerned, on the one hand, the children who have undergone cyberbullying and, on the other hand, a group of 2,000 adults. The survey shows that 35 percent of children who have suffered cyberbullying have committed acts of self - injury, 55 have fallen into depression and 38 percent have thought of suicide. Here I cannot fail to remember the victims, those who took their lives, and the insurmountable pain of families. On the other hand, on the side of the adults interviewed, in the face of this fatigue that young people experience having undergone cyberbullying, do you know what comes out? 34 percent thought that basically acts of cyberbullying are a normal phase of growth, while 16 percent consider cyberbullying as something that forms character: in short, 50 percent of the adults interviewed do not have the right perception of the violence that suffers those who are subjected to cyberbullying and not even of the violence and discomfort that their children and children have. The world of adults must be reconnected with reality. Also for this reason it is essential that both in the bill and in the guidelines of the public education, which I remember has already financed with 2 million euros training interventions in the school, they are indicated as important subjects to involve also the families and all the institutions that have competence in education and in the accompaniment to the growth. Correct education on the Net helps overcome cyberbullying, but there is another important thing: the perception of the danger inherent in the misuse of the Network. I say this because it is important that the protection of minors is considered and perceived and stirs up as a collective responsibility that must be shared by parents, institutions and operators and the fight against cyberbullying cannot ignore the synergies of these forces and the conscious use of the web by everyone. That ministerial and territorial table will have to be inclusive and the training and co-formation of all the institutional and professional entities that will be part of it is essential. Not the formation disjoined, but the co-formation because only in this way is built not only an embankment to spread the phenomenon, but also a new common awareness that will also help to avoid other heavy consequences to those who use not correctly or unconsciously the web. We know that one out of every three children makes new acquaintances on the net, which are then realized by real relationships. I would like to point out a figure that has come out of the bicameral committee\\'s survey of children\\'s prostitution. I do not quote the figures at random, but because they were dramatically denounced in the opening of the judicial year. In large urban areas since last year, child prostitution has increased by 400 percent. Of this 400 percent, a very high percentage (almost 60 percent) is made through net lure. Therefore, a conscious and correct use of the network means not only helping overcome cyberbullying, but also avoiding other terrible damages that through misuse of the network increase child pornography and prostitution cases through online solicitation. I hope that the draft law that we adopted in the Committee on Institutional Affairs unanimously comes out of this House and will be adopted as quickly as possible in the House, so that, together with the Ministry\\'s guidelines, which are already funded with insufficient but important resources (two million euros), it can really quickly activate not only an information journey but also that training path with respect to the fundamental respect for itself and for others. It is a path of promoting true citizenship, but also of promoting the fundamental element of the social question, that is, individual and collective well-being. <p> I shall refer the following to another session of the debate on the draft law.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.688942551612854, 0.3110574781894684]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, today's draft law concerns the ratification and implementation of the Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of the French Republic for the implementation and operation of a new Turin-Lyon railway line, signed in Rome on 30 January 2012. The text, already approved by the House of Deputies, consists of five articles necessary to ratify this Agreement. The Agreement defines the general framework for the implementation of the rail link project between Turin and Lyon, as well as the subsequent management of the Italian-French cross-border section. <p> I would like to point out that the Agreement does not in itself allow the construction of the link to be started; a further Additional Protocol between Italy and France will be necessary. I therefore do not understand the ostracism of the 5 Star and SEL Movement, nor the presentation of a total of 1,116 amendments and agendas; a blind and unproductive obstructionism. <p> It is certainly true that the work is also criticized by a part of the populations concerned, but with many of them, especially those who reject violent manifestations, the conversation has been held constantly and agreements have been reached that convince us to support the process of this measure. The final project differs substantially from the original one, since many of the observations made by the local people and their representatives at institutional level have been accepted. The Agreement does not result in any new or increased burden on public finance. The costs will be incurred only at the time of signature of the Protocol and will be provided for in the draft law ratifying the Protocol. It should be noted that the Turin-Lion high-speed line is part of the Lisbon-Kiev Corridor 5, one of the ten most important transport links in the European Union, both for passengers and freight. I stress that the work can provide Italy with significant economic and employment benefits, and allows a strong reduction in pollution related to road transport. The technical data shows that this is an important infrastructure for our country: 33 kilometers in France, 57 kilometers of tunnels, 3 kilometers open in Susa and 19,5 kilometers between Susa and Chiusa S. Michele. The total cost is about 23 billion, half of which is borne by Italy. The potential traffic in 2035, year in which the inauguration is previewed, will be pairs to 25,5 million tons; this traffic will lighten also the tunnel of the Frejus, that otherwise would reach 39.9 million tons per year against the current 15,5. And again, 17 million passengers by car and 4.5 million passengers by rail make understand the strategicity of the work. The benefits are obvious, considering that it is expected that in the yards will be occupied 1,850 people direct annual and 5,800 people will be occupied in the induced. The number of persons employed under the scheme will be 280 per year and 140 per person employed under the scheme. France has already ratified the Agreement and the opposition is certainly a small minority, having also understood the French part what the strategic interest of the infrastructure is. That is to say that we are in favour of the ratification and implementation of the Agreement between Italy and France. PRESIDENT. - The debate is closed.

One of these is the local authorities. For some years now, one of the most harmful and controversial battles that have united the parties of this majority is that of the cuts and the reduction of the costs of politics, with the illusory hope that this demagogic idea could be the solution of all evils.

Mr President, I have signed the motion and therefore, of course, I support it, but I would also like to offer a consideration to the Government, which kindly listens to us. The measure we propose does not involve any additional State resources, nor does it involve any less State revenue. This is not a welfare measure and it is not an aid measure. We ask that the Italian State and the European Union itself, since Switzerland is a non-EU country, calculates properly, I would say safely, what can be the results of the adoption of the measure that we propose. I also mention the precedent that my colleague Senator Candiani has already mentioned and that he then negotiated with the State, in the years 2000 and 2001, in my capacity as President of the Lombardy Region. Actually, it took us several months to convince the state to take the measure of lowering excise duties on fuels sold in the border bands (i.e. in the 20 and 30 km range). When the State finally became convinced and accepted, the state's revenues increased considerably, following the increased sale of discounted fuels compared to the previous time, but that Italian consumers resident in those border areas preferred to buy in Italy, instead of going to buy them in the nearby Swiss Confederation. Since then, from 2001 to the whole year 2013, the Italian State has collected more: there is talk of more receipts for the Italian State for tens of millions of euros as a result of that favourable tax regime, which allowed Italian consumers resident in those border areas to spend less. It has allowed those areas not to be deserted from the point of view of the presence of fuel distributors; it has therefore allowed several families that practiced that trade to continue to live. It is the typical win-win solution, where everyone wins and where, if anything, the Swiss citizens lose themselves; but the Swiss citizens do not fall under our jurisdiction and therefore it is not up to us to suggest measures to them. They have sufficient skill and have fought with us in a diversified way to try to recover those revenues. We must constantly update the tariffs; it is a nice trade war, but so far it has seen the winners of both the Lombard consumers, the Italian State and the European Union itself. I therefore ask the Government - and I am sure that this will be the case - to apply to the competent Brussels and Strasbourg offices so that the Commission too will make this calculation, and I call on the House to support this motion.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7174422144889832, 0.28255778551101685]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, it is to the free movement of ideas, which travel with people, goods and information technology, that the positive efforts and actions to be taken over this 17th legislature must be addressed. Having a horizon, giving oneself a polar star is the task of the most knowledgeable ruling classes, which is also entrusted with the driving role of involving, in democratic terms, the social body of the country. <p> The improvement of rail transport along the Adriatic ridge is one of the founding themes of the economic and financial programming of the next decade, as well as the shortening of the north-south distances of the peninsula, oriented to favor a process of inclusion in the southern part of the country to the regions of the center-northern. <p> In short, it is time to give broad adherence to the legitimate demands of modernity, of contemporaneity of the southern populations, freeing them from the weight of development delays, historical slowness, apathy and resignation: attitudes these, senator lords, who have filled and fill still today wide pages of literature and custom, narrative and essay, often with accents of teasing and derision, on some occasions motivated, given the manifest faults of the protagonists. <p> So let us think of the young people, the many women and men who today, as unfortunately yesterday, for reasons of work or study are forced and have been forced to live the railway distances as nightmares. Let us not leave these generations to resignation; let us crush them from the physical and psychological discomfort of farewells, freeing them from the urgent need to emigrate at a high price by abandoning affections, legitimate interests and life prospects. <p> How far-sighted was the vision of the legislators and the post-unitary ruling classes in thinking, lawmaking, planning the realization, in the second half of the nineteenth century and in the early years of the twentieth century, of the great infrastructures of the country. Let\\'s think of the extraordinary epic of the Autostrada del Sole, but also of the highway 16, the one that runs along the Adriatic dorsal (the zero kilometer is placed in Padua, the thousand kilometer is placed in Otranto). Let\\'s think about the railway Bologna-Otranto: it has shortened distances and put the Italians in a position to call themselves such and to feel united. It is said that there is no economic sustainability. It is said that there is not enough question. But it is not said, Senators, that demand can be supported by an adequate infrastructure supply and that economic sustainability will be able to find adequate satisfaction, inevitably implementing the great tourist flows that from the North of Europe will be able to flow into the Mezzogiorno, as part of a desirable effort of modernization of the country passing through the use of new technologies of communication, the formation of human capital, the infrastructural endowment and the intermodality of the means of transport. The museums, the art galleries, the fascinating historic centers, the archaeological ruins and the extraordinary coasts of the South can therefore represent the supply and stimulate the demand. Employment will also benefit and young people, with their degrees and diplomas, will be able to find employment, even self-employment, because this choral social effort will be able to participate in the best energies of the South, the most beautiful talents of Italy. Adhering to this motion and to the subsequent one, we put the South in a position not to contemplate its navel, like a fallen nobility that sees the shadows of the magnagreci, the Byzantine and the Norman-Svevi. So let us give dignity to this remote past by redeeming the recent past and especially our present, the winter of our discontent. Senators, we haven\\'t dared. Maybe we didn\\'t want to dare to think big. The call is therefore to implement every action aimed at meeting the demand for participation: we involve schools, the education system, the business world and the professions. Politics is asked, in this process, to give body and substance to the demand for participation, favouring the social debate in the country, with the involvement of stakeholders and the world of information. In this regard, Mr President, I must praise the valuable initiative taken by the major, for vetusity and for reading, the regional newspaper, the \"Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno\" (Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno), which first interviewed the presidents and administrators of the Adriatic coastal regions, from Friuli Venezia Giulia to Puglia, and then gathered them in an extraordinary workshop recently held in Bari.

The responsibility of this page will be a matter of reflection and perhaps also a bit of investigation on why and why an attempt at mediation, the one attempted by Senator Chiti to restore a climate of constitutional collaboration, even in the distinction of roles and opinions, has not gone through. Now, Mr President, much of the weight of the need for the debate in this House to proceed in a positive and conclusive way rests on your shoulders.

I didn't share yesterday's attacks that were brought to his person.

In this interview Barbera seems almost to suggest (in fact, she openly suggests) the adoption of this mechanism and refers to the previous experience, by now many years ago, of the President of the Chamber Nilde Iotti, an unforgettable person for all of us, who used that mechanism to tame the obstructionism that then came - Barbera says - from the radicals and the ranks of the Communist Party itself (of which many heirs are present here in the Group of the Democratic Party), the same Group that had indicated Nilde Iotti to the Presidency of the Chamber. I have read with emotion this memory of Barbera because, beyond technicalism, it reminds us as one of the greatest Presidents of a Parliamentary Chamber - Nilde Iotti, precisely - knew, in crucial moments, how to distinguish itself from its own field of origin and belonging. <p> I know that you - and you have shown this on more than one occasion - know how to be the President of all, not the President of the party for which you participated in the election campaign and from which you were brought to this House. <p> I ask you, then, if you have five minutes of patience, to explain once again, in order to allow all of us a more mature reflection on how things are going and how the debate in this House develops, the relationship with the high tradition of Italian parliamentaryism and, in particular, with the nature of the kangaroo mechanism, which there is not in the Rules of Procedure and practice of the Senate, but that there is in that of the House, with the exception declared in the Statute of Constitutional Laws, which some colleagues raised yesterday. <p> I have no prejudices of any kind, we can also innovate, but an innovation of this magnitude - which I understand, but perhaps I am wrong, and I would ask to be enlightened - deserves an additional explanation, because perhaps in this way the atmosphere of this House will improve.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5094646215438843, 0.4905353784561157]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, Madam Representative for the Government, ladies and gentlemen, the converted decree-law has the merit of ensuring the continuity of the State's presence in the areas of Emilia-Romagna marked by three tragic and calamitous events affecting families, communities and businesses in those territories. <p> It is therefore necessary to share the ratio of the decree in question. Even for a political force placed at the opposition such as ours, the reasons and purposes of the measure are to be welcomed and supported, without giving in to the easy and hypocritical temptation of exploitation for exclusively demagogic use. Moreover, I would like to point out that already in the transition to the Chamber the Group of Forza Italia has committed itself seriously to improving and further enriching the decree. The text, as we have heard, is divided into two parts: two articles dealing respectively with the urgent interventions of the Commissioner for the reconstruction of the Emilia-Romagna Region and the integration of the National Emergency Fund. Article 1 certainly has the merit of improving and completing reconstruction activities. In order to achieve this objective, the breakdown of financial resources for private individuals, economic activities and hydraulic safety works is specified in detail. The measures identified to give benefits to farmers affected by calamitous events are very welcome. These measures are introduced by paragraph 5-a of Article 1, which refers to Legislative Decree no. 102 of 2004. They also have the advantage of simplifying paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, which govern the powers conferred on the Commissioner and the arrangements for granting contributions. All the provisions relating to the management of the loan operations carried out by the owners of buildings destroyed or inaccessible are certainly acceptable: these are several paragraphs, which deal with different needs, all of which must be taken into account. These reflections, together with those concerning the use of the tax credit, the measures relating to the Cassa Integrazione Guadi and the extension of the terms of Decree-Law No 74 of 2012 for the buildings used as main residence - to allow therefore also the sanatoria of the registration, with a mockery payment of 2 percent - are the positive and most shareable part of the decree-law. Article 2 deals with the operation of the National Emergency Fund, and I must make a negative comment on this, because the results are not satisfactory, given its limited appropriations. In particular, it should be pointed out that this legislative text completely escapes the issue of the prevention of hydrogeological failure. It should be pointed out that in recent years the two branches of Parliament have repeatedly raised this issue with motions, draft laws and other parliamentary initiatives; yet, on this occasion too, the Government has glittered on the subject, limiting itself to addressing only the issue of emergencies. I understand that there was a problem of skills and subjects that were not to be superimposed, but, as we have heard from Senator Uras, the problem arises again and there are laws that are waiting for answers in this regard; moreover, all this goes to the detriment of the needs of prevention. It is therefore the most appropriate forum to remind ourselves and the Government that the objective of preventing hydrogeological risk must be a priority, to remind them that it does not live there by Expo alone or by MOSE alone, to emphasize that in the last two years no concrete initiative has yet been implemented by the Executive: we are still at the slogans and record the punctual tragic recriminations of the next day without being able to do anything. Returning to the decree-law under consideration, the inconsistency of the Government with respect to the role assigned to the Provinces of Modena and Bologna is still to be highlighted. The same government that empties the Provinces (in fact, that abolishes them with constitutional reform), then realizes their function, their irreplaceability, and tries to involve them in the management of emergencies. In this case, the comment would be a bitter irony that could be used to point out the inconsistency and contradiction of government policies. Before concluding, let me give you two more reflections. The first concerns the invitation to the Government to address the problem of the recent natural disasters that have affected several areas of Puglia, with considerable damage to the agricultural enterprises of that territory. In the coming days I expect eloquent and punctual answers also with the use of the National Fund, as well as in Article 2; however, if it is true what happens for Sardinia (and I refer again to the words of Senator Uras), I do not have much hope from this point of view. The second consideration, Mr President, is of a more political nature, and concerns the management of emergencies in our country. Over the past few years, the work of the center-right governments has been stigmatized for the frequent use of emergency legislation and commissionerial powers, as if this practice were the figure of the governments of President Berlusconi: after years the same practices take place also under other Executives, without particular and significant differences.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6369242072105408, 0.363075852394104]}, {'sequence': \"Mr President, I would like to reason with my colleagues on Decree-Law No 19 to deal with the emergency from Covid-19.

I think they\\'re proposals of common sense, like the ones we at the League are used to carrying on. I am thinking, for example, of extending to people with disabilities, suffering from cancer or serious illness, the exemption from the motorway toll for transfers, specialist medical visits and treatment, or the payment of the train ticket and the reduction of 50% for those accompanying them. I still think of the incentives to take the necessary licences for freight transport, as well as out of the House, without forgetting the transport of people. This is an important point, a fundamental deficiency affecting the drivers of heavy goods vehicles. This shortcoming can only be addressed by encouraging young people to cope with this type of work, bringing together labour demand and supply. There are other measures; the mandatory safety belts on the school buses, the allocation of resources for new hirings at the civil motorizations. We know, for example, in my province, Bergamo, but also in the neighbouring Provinces, I think of Como, what is meant by the very strong expectation of driving licences and revisions due to the lack of staff.

We cannot believe that our mountain municipalities are abandoned. <p> They are proposals of common sense that have taken forward the League and that have been approved as agendas; I really hope that with the commitment of the Government they can become reality. Within this measure, which comes from the other Chamber, there are really important commitments, which concern: the timely realization of the interventions of adaptation of the Olympic bob and sled track of Cortina d\\'Ampezzo, with an appropriation of 24.5 million euros; facilities for the society Infrastructures Milan Cortina 2020-2026; simplifications of the procedural iter and acceleration of the works previewed by the Plan. However, we cannot miss this opportunity. The Olympic Games represent an exciting challenge, an opportunity for the whole country, important to solve the junctions between our regions, which will serve, yes, for races, but also in the future for all our citizens. Keeping together more reality is a good opportunity to involve the territories and make sure that you do not miss this precious opportunity that is offered to us. Many other rules have been adopted, as other colleagues have also mentioned, such as parking spaces for pregnant women and parents of children up to two years old, the famous \"pink stalls,\" which up to now were not completely normalized. There is also the regulation on the use of scooters. Probably what has been approved will not be enough. If it is true that, on the one hand, scooters are the green revolution (there is all this ideology about the fact that it is however a simple and green means of transport), on the other hand we must be careful that this green new does not become road rude, because for now what we have seen is this. <p> The issue of heavy-duty vehicle revisions, including for trailers and semi-trailers, has finally been resolved. <p> There are novelties to understand in the category of vintage vehicles of interest and collectivism also mopeds and agricultural machines. <p> There is a free parking area for disabled vehicles in paid parking spaces, if their stalls are occupied. <p> I mean, there are so many important things. It was an opportunity, however, to be able to work as a Senate. We, with common sense, have agreed to be able to work even in such a short time.

I am starting from a fact that I too had pointed out and was taken up by many: the measure that is at our examination has a long process behind it, but let me stress that this does not mean that it has been a waste of time. Some more urgent parts of the bill as it originally was have already been in force for some time, having been deleted and having been inserted in other regulatory vehicles, because the urgency there pushed the action of government. During the course of time new parties have been added both in the first reading in the Senate and in the Chamber of Deputies. In any case I believe that everyone can recognize that the bill today retains its true organicity, in part with different characterizations, in part preserving many aspects of the original plant. The novelties derive precisely from greater deepening and adaptation to the changed political and factual context general and sectoral. I am not here to reiterate - I have already done this in detail yesterday - the most important areas of action in the draft law. Let me, however, stress once again that these are areas of primary importance which have found support and support from the vast world of those directly concerned. I would also like to mention - because I took note of this in the course of the debate - the problems which have been raised, which relate to matters which are undoubtedly important and which have been complained of in the draft law. But here too the point I want to make is that this is not an omnibus measure. The issues that have been mentioned are important: those who have mentioned milk quotas, those who have competed with imports of rice from abroad, those who are mountain farming, those who are in agricultural education, those who are in phytosanitary emergencies and scientific research, those who are in agri-environmental crime, those are pesticides, those who are in imbalances in the agri-food chain, those who are protecting the Italian agri-food heritage in general or the important issue of female entrepreneurship in agriculture. It is true that these issues are not specifically considered within this measure, but I would like to point out - especially to those of my colleagues who are not members of the Agriculture Commission - that some of these issues have already been dealt with by the Committee on Agriculture for a long time, with diligence and diligence. We will therefore be able to propose specific interventions to the House on these issues in the coming weeks and months. Other issues are on the agenda or are in our drafts for action. I believe, therefore, that it can be said that, overall, the Senate, its Commission and the Government are trying to outline, during this legislature, an organic intervention on all the issues that concern the primary sector. I would also like to thank my fellow Senators who stressed in their speeches that the measure is an important signal in this area. This measure represents - as I said yesterday - in some ways a point of arrival, for others a point of departure. We deliver important delegations into the hands of the Government and we hope that there will be an urgent action on the part of the Government to ensure that these delegations, once implemented, give further legal certainty to the system. Moreover, the immediately perceptive provisions are, in some respects, even more important and important than the delegations and will allow with immediate simplifications regulations. I would like to stress this point: Parliament and public opinion have been debating simplifications for too long, but the simplifications contained in this measure respond to important demands and will facilitate the lives and work of employees. There are support measures in productive sectors, measures to meet the supply and demand of agricultural land; we intervene on the functionality of agricultural activities through network contracts, on the fight against fishing and aquaculture infringements and on the fight against fishing poaching in inland waters. Never, as in this parliamentary term - I am convinced, Madam President - has the synergy between the Government and Parliament allowed important interventions in the agricultural sector. I recall again - nobody can forget it - the law on social agriculture, that on the protection of agrarian and food biodiversity, the conversion of the decree-law on the revival of the agricultural sector, as well as important profiles of competences in broader laws, first of all the decree-competitiveness law. Once again, economic data in this area is right. The economic data confirm a positive development of the agricultural sector; certainly, not without criticality, but the overall sign is clearly positive. This is, therefore, a trend that must be sustained and consolidated, because it can make even more important the action of our fellow citizens engaged in this field; and this despite the difficulties, which come from natural causes (the numerous disasters) or are of a political type (I think of the Russian embargo and the always unfair competition that we have to verify on the foreign markets). We are responding to these challenges - and we want to respond more and more - with the protection of excellence and qualities that make our food products the most famous in the world. That is why I renew my invitation to my colleagues in the Senate to approve this measure. <p> Mr President, I would ask you to be able to give me an additional text of my speech so that it is annexed to the shorthand report of today's sitting.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5150021314620972, 0.48499786853790283]}, {'sequence': \"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure that we are going to adopt - as has already been well mentioned in the previous speech - has an ancient genesis, which dates back to two legislatures ago. However, the importance and the need to conclude its approval remains unchanged, because we know how much the agricultural sector has suffered from serious difficulties that have persisted for many, too many years. <p> I come from a region with a winemaking vocation, from a territory that produces excellence and that has been able to question itself since the seventies-eighties, preferring to an extensive production an intensive production, quantitatively reduced and selected, which wanted to look at the quality of production instead of the quantity. At first it might seem a heresy to give up production numbers, but time has given reason to that generation of young farmers who have been able to make a courageous choice and, in many ways, in opposition to the way of thinking of their parents and grandparents. It is an example of a happy choice. However, there are conditions - the term must be understood literally - that go beyond the will of the operators and do not allow to choose, do not allow other roads. These conditions are dictated by nature, by the morphology of the territory: for us the karst ridge, which runs along the sea to Trieste and has morphological characteristics similar to those of the land destined to citrus grove, which is the subject of discussion today. Again we are in a situation where the use of machinery is inhibited by the morphology of the ground, which involves manual processing. Here too we are talking about intensive and non-extensive plantings. Also in this case we are in the presence of dry walls that need continuous maintenance. Here again we are talking about areas subject to hydrogeological risk, which constitute a historic heritage in the production of indigenous crops with virtually unchanged methods over time. It is the island territory of the coastal bands of particular landscape value at hydrogeological risk. <p> This preamble means that the measures contained in today's draft law - and I am referring in particular to the allocation of contributions in support of those who challenge the time and the laws of free competition of the markets - are indispensable in order to safeguard both the territory, understood as heritage, from a degradation and a progressive abandonment, and the agro-food excellences that distinguish, here as elsewhere, our country on a global level. <p> With all due respect for European regulation, which we know is essential and to which we stressed in the measure the alignment on the basis of the principle contained in Article 1 ('Finalities') there are no justifications if, in order to standardise the market and its rules, we risk destroying the peculiarities that distinguish each country of the great European family. <p> Therefore, rules are indispensable for the protection, recovery and protection of the precious citrus groves characteristic of the territories that are of particular value for the country. These are the terraces of our coastal areas, such as the Amalfi Coast, Gargano, the coasts of Calabria and Sicily, Garda, where the cultivation of citrus groves is not only a fundamental source of income, but also an important factor of environmental protection, preservation of the integrity of the territories and coastal natural balance. <p> The measure in our examination favours the conservation of traditional landscapes and the protection of biodiversity in order to enhance a product with unique characteristics. The objective of the legislative intervention is therefore to support one of the characteristic crops of our coastal and island territory in the Mediterranean, re-launching the Italian citrus cultivation for years in a state of deep crisis; crisis determined by unsustainable production costs due to the presence of small companies, little connected with each other and with the processing and distribution industry; with obsolete promotion and marketing strategies, which no longer hold up to the increasing foreign competition. <p> The harshness of the places not accessible by mechanical means - as I have already said - determines the use of manual work which today is inexpensive and tiring both for crops and for transport. From this comes the abandonment by the farmers, already highlighted by the colleague who preceded me; farmers few and elderly who still practice so-called heroic agriculture, with the degradation of the social fabric and the loss of a job become over time a fundamental part of the culture of those territories, but also with the progressive alteration of the landscape. In fact, the presence of uncultivated areas and land-use damage, deprived of the maintenance of the farmers, is increasingly visible and hydrogeological phenomena are increasingly visible, due to the loss of the function of dry walls that the terraces carry out in the containment work of both water and land. <p> As I said initially for the karst ridge, we must stop the slow and inexorable degradation and the abandonment of those territories, supporting those who work to safeguard an invaluable rural landscape and productions of unique quality. That is why I would like to congratulate the Members who have been able to conclude the legislative process of a measure much awaited by all the producers of citrus fruit, especially the smaller ones, who, with difficulty and so much effort, have been able to resist in recent years, at the cost of great sacrifices. These farmers deserve, with gratitude, to keep alive the extraordinary, spectacular coastal landscape.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5438389778137207, 0.4561610221862793]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> ANITORI (<PARTY>). Mr President, I would like to express a general appreciation for the content of this decree-law, because the aim of the measure is to achieve an effective composition among the various requirements that must be met in the administration of justice, the urgency of ensuring the speed and bureaucracy of the proceedings, the need to ensure working conditions that promote the professionalism and efficiency of the magistrates. I therefore intend to refer to some significant passages of the bill: first of all the provision of Article 1, whereby the magistrates employed in the office of the maximum and the role can be used exceptionally to compose the judicial colleges, both civil and criminal, of the Court of Cassation, with the just aim of strengthening the organizational garrisons necessary for a faster disposal of the backward. Always dealing with this topic, it is appreciated the intervention of the Chamber at first reading, which limited the application of the provision only to magistrates who have achieved the third professional evaluation and placing a three-year limit non renewable. Article 2 provides for measures to improve the efficiency of judicial offices: to cover the staff gaps of the ordinary judiciary, up to a tenth of the number of places available among those put in competition in the 2014-2015 two-year period will increase; moreover, it will be possible to obtain a faster coverage of vacancies in the staff of the first-degree judicial offices through the reduction of the internship, from eighteen to twelve months, of the magistrates declared suitable for the outcome of competitions launched in the years 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, with regard to the provisions of Article 3, I would like to stress that this applies only to the period of legitimacy within which a magistrate may apply for a transfer to another office or to another function. The extension to four years is dictated by the consideration, moreover easily shared, that the three-year term is not fully sufficient so that the magistrate can make an effective contribution to the full performance of the assigned assignments: when you enter a system, in fact, we must guarantee a time horizon that puts the magistrate in the condition to carry out that function with the necessary planning of the choices of the office and with the highest stability of the position, prerequisite for the full manifestation of professionalism and ability. I therefore believe that the rule of Article 4 also goes in the right direction, aimed at exploiting all the human resources available within the staff: it is established, in fact, that the staff of the chancellories and of the judicial secretariats and the staff assigned to the surveillance offices cannot be temporarily assigned to other offices of the judicial district of belonging without the nullity-host of the president of the supervisory court. At the same time and consistently, until 31 December 2019 the non-directive staff of the Ministry of Justice cannot be commanded, seconded or assigned to other administrations. The intervention of Articles 5 and 10 of the Decree-Law, far from representing violations of the principles relating to equality and equal treatment, let alone interference in the competences of an autonomous and independent order such as the judiciary, as it was felt during the discussion at the other branch of Parliament and also in this Senate, must be understood as strictly limited over time and aimed exclusively at ensuring continuity in the apical and managerial duties at the Supreme Court of Cassation, its general prosecutor, the Court of Auditors and the Court of Auditors' Court of Auditors, because of the multiple requests for reform for the definition of pending litigation. Chapter II of the Decree-Law is dedicated to the telematic administrative process. The articles in question contain important forecasts aimed at enabling the electronic administrative process to take place, laying down precise rules for the coordination and adaptation of the discipline to principles of common sense, functionality and simplicity of compliance. Specifically, the new process mechanisms based on technology, the launch of which is already scheduled for 1 January 2017, will be promoted by simplifying its operation, through the introduction of measures to harmonise the tools of the telematic administrative process with the code of the digital administration. I am referring in particular to the digital domicile and the extension to lawyers defenders of the attestation of the probative effectiveness of copies by image of paper documents. The same objective is pursued by measures aimed at extending the use of the procedures for the filing of documents also for entities not equipped with certified e-mails. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, this is an urgent measure which, after having also been duly integrated by Parliament, provides rapid, concrete and effective instruments to continue to attack, beyond the usual and sterile preconceived criticism, the chronic ills that afflict the field of justice of our country.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6093499660491943, 0.3906500041484833]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, this decree of value for culture is a long-awaited measure, and it is certainly worthwhile that the Government has tried to give answers to a crucial sector for the development of our country. There are so many good intentions, so many good things, but as many shadows, I have to say frankly; what is missing is above all an overall project and what strikes the most is the return in style to the state and welfare approach - as in the case of the lyric foundations - to the detriment of a necessary path of liberal reforms. But the biggest flaw perhaps lies in finding resources with the usual system of the increase of the excises, imposed by the usual Ministry of the economy, recently renamed with a good neologism: • Ministry of Gasoline • Ministry of Gasoline • Ministry of Gasoline • The vice is always the same: to invent new taxes to the detriment of a coherent development of the sector that rewards those who have managed their budgets wisely, instead of throwing millions and millions of euros to lose money. <p> It took more courage, in short, and the People of Liberty, through its amendments, strongly pushed towards the main road of a fiscalization that favors the intervention of the private in the culture. However, we do not give up on those who, for convenience, find no better for financial cover than fishing in the pockets of citizens, instead of cutting unproductive state spending. In fact, the decree provides that excise duties will once again finance the permanent tax credit for 50 million euros to the cinema sector, a measure which, moreover, goes in the right direction and which has been loudly demanded by companies operating in the sector, which otherwise would have enormous difficulties in planning further investments for the future. The new jumps will then affect smoking products, lubricating oils and alcohol. But it is philosophy that inspires this provision to be the most questionable thing. The finding of resources takes place in the usual way: it is always pervicaciously going to affect consumption, they take away funds, even if provisionally (and we hope that the Government in this regard will keep the word, in the sense of a rapid return to that chapter of expenditure), to the measure paid-businesses, a measure that many small and medium-sized companies have been waiting for years and whose expectations cannot be disappointed once again. Once we define our stakes on the financial aspects, I also want to clarify the terms of a useless controversy, raised by the mayor of Florence on the hypothesis that the <PARTY> wanted to boycott the Great Uffizi in retaliation towards some unfortunate statements of Renzi himself. As a Tuscan, I can only be happy with the attention this Government shows towards Florence, although I must point out that the mayor, a former scraper and now aspiring asphalter, acts as if he were Lorenzo the Magnificent, even if under his administration the Florentine musical May has reached its failure. But, leaving aside the Renzi controversy, on the New Uffizi there is a point on which we will watch with great attention: the report annexed to the decree says in fact that \"Since the available funding did not allow to contract the entire project, unitarily conceived, the same was subsequently divided into two lots. At present, a total of EUR 50,600,000 remains to be financed in order to complete the project. And he goes on to say: In order not to frustrate the possibility of continuing with the custody of the ATI, it is essential that there be a constant flow of adequate funding...................................................................................................... Well, here we put an unavoidable question of transparency, because it would be at least abnormal to entrust tout court to those who won only the first contract all the execution of the works. This is a problem that we are putting forward and on which we are waiting for precise answers. As far as Florence is concerned, we have tabled an agenda to guarantee the autonomy of the Opificio delle Pietre Grazie and to increase its staff. We are talking - for those who did not know - about one of the few world excellences that we have left. Since the project intended to definitively annex the Opificio to the Florentine Museum Polo was fortunately withdrawn, it seems obvious and natural that the Opificio is put in a position to function best, with a transfer of personnel without any additional burden for the state coffers. I begin to conclude by pointing out that this decree value culture represents an act due to such an important sector also as a flywheel of economic development, but it has been conceived with a view too statist and with an approach that lacks organicity. The call, for example, of 500 young people who will be employed as trainees to catalog cultural heritage risks becoming yet another factory of illusions. Just as the Grande Progetto Pompei will not have to trace old experiences of carriages that have proved useless or insufficient to give concrete answers to a cultural heritage of inestimable value. There is one last point to note: companies operating in Italy in the cultural and creative field are faced with enormous problems in accessing credit, due to the inability of banks to properly assess intangible assets (ideas, such as in the United States). In short, there would be a need for a cultural revolution that in this decree is not there, even if approving it we will try to see the glass half full, promising to work so that politics gives a response to the level, able at last to take full advantage of the potential of a cultural and artistic heritage unique in the world.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6092460751533508, 0.3907538950443268]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> <PARTY>IMBERTI (<PARTY>). Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Senator Pelino for the spirit and work she has done in carrying out this draft law. The aerospace industry is strategic in advanced economies, as a generator of wealth and high technology, and Italy, with its two billion euros, ranks third in Europe behind only Germany and France. Those who preceded me stressed that the economic return of the research and technological application activities of this sector are five times higher than investments, with a concrete impact on the entire industrial sector, because the aerospace sector derives more patents and applications covering entire sectors: from telecommunications to security, from infrastructure to construction and even pharmacology. I would like to stress that aerospace is an Italian excellence. In fact, despite our economic model is composed of a network of medium and small industries, it is confirmed at the forefront also in the various levels that make up the production chain. And this is demonstrated by the many successes we have achieved in recent years in the various space missions to which we have contributed through housing modules, communication systems, scientific satellites and propulsion systems. Think of the many collaborations with NASA, which have been consolidated over the years, as well as our participation with a primary role in ESA, the European Space Agency. And it is precisely in Europe that an Italian company, AVIO, has scored yet another milestone: the production of the world's largest monolithic solid carbon fibre engine, which will equip the new European launchers. However, the great dynamism and efficiency of our companies are not enough to enable the sector to unlock the potential that it really has. In fact, we need a unitary organization and an overall industrial policy that impose those effective responses and that strategic vision that our country would desperately need, but that the last governments have not been able to guarantee. Therefore, the Forza Italia Group can only look favorably at a measure that aims to equip the space and aerospace sectors with a new system of Government that keeps more and more in mind the complexity of the challenges of the sector, the need for a holistic approach guaranteed by a structured coordination and to give back centrality to the debate on the role of the space industry in Italy; a task so far well carried out by the Italian Space Agency, which has been able to guide the sector always at the forefront of the world, but which will now be made even easier thanks to the creation of a coordination committee, placed under the direction and political responsibility of the President of the Council of Ministers, who can effectively support the ASI. To underline the real reversal of trend and the centrality that is intended to give to the topic of aerospace policies, it is sufficient to scroll through the list of Ministers provided for by this measure in the Interministerial Committee for Space and Aerospace Research Policies: ten Ministers to which are added the President of the Conference of the Presidents of the Regions and the President of the Italian Space Agency. In the light of what has just been said and in the hope that the path taken for the aerospace sector with this bill, through the definition of strategies, industrial policies, synergies and development lines, can represent the main path to follow for the development of the entire country with an industrial policy worthy of this name, I announce the favorable vote of the Forza Italia Group.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6238901615142822, 0.37610986828804016]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, I rise to explain the agenda for the G7300, which replaces my withdrawn amendment 7.0.7. <p> The agenda concerns an apparently secondary but paradigmatic issue of the various unresolved issues of our country: an earthquake forgotten or removed by all, that of 1967 in the valley of Belice. <p> Several people know, as I believe you too, Mr President, that in those areas of Sicily there are still territories and people crying out for revenge against the delays of the state and the bureaucracy.

Of course, we of Brothers of Italy are not and will never be for a consumption of wild soil, but we cannot remain hostage. <p> We must say that there has been great scientific progress in recent years, including with regard to innovative materials, and this could enable us to govern the process of energy transition in our territories and also in our cities. We know perfectly well that there is no zero impact. <p> What is lacking in this measure is clear, namely a reference to fuels, which nowadays certainly represent one of the highest costs that both companies and citizens have to face. <p> So this is certainly a problem and the government has done little or even nothing to date. <p> Let us not forget that inflation rose to 6.7 percent in March. The transport sector, which is certainly a very important sector with regard to our country - especially the rubber sector - plays a primary role and is also a key sector with regard to the employment front, so the objective would be to immediately reduce the excise duty of 40%, as we have repeatedly proposed in all the various Commissions. We must also intervene on VAT and not create disparities, as many industry associations denounce. An entire chain risks being brought to its knees because of this Government which has created a real competition between fuels. It is clear that this situation has become unsustainable, both for operators in the sector and especially for users. The process of ecological transition, of which so much is spoken (and, as I prefer to define it, of ecological conversion, because in fact they are all conversions), is irreversible and crucial and must lead Italy towards the definitive abandonment of fossil sources and adopt more sustainable energy sources, as I said before. Mr President, we know perfectly well that nothing has a zero impact, but we must also get used to the idea that we can no longer procrastinate and that we also need sensible and courageous choices. <p> In this measure, as I said before, I see no simplification at all. Unfortunately, this decree-law creates additional bureaucracy and above all confusion. That same bureaucracy, perhaps, represents the worst limit for achieving the decarbonisation objectives, so much desired. These limits, of course, will never allow us, continuing with this step, to achieve what our country needs, namely energy independence. <p> The real nightmare, especially in recent years, is the construction of RES plants (renewable energy sources), but the lack of streamlined procedures discourages investments in our country. Let's not forget that Germany has started running, also launching an important plan to install 20 gigawatts per year for the next three years, which will accelerate to increase to 40 gigawatts until 2035. Same thing France is doing. What about Italy? Nothing, and this is definitely your demerit. <p> The aim is to avoid losing the great opportunities that are provided to us, as we have always said in this House, by the PNRR. We must remind all of us that it will be our children and also grandchildren who will repay the debt. Therefore, it should also be implemented in a strategic way. <p> What is lacking today is not only strategy, but also foresight. You have not approved any solution regarding the promotion of self-production and self-consumption of energy for households and businesses. The energy efficiency of buildings must be encouraged. <p> Let us not forget that a large part of the public administration offices is old and obsolete. And I want to denounce, in this House, also the waste of heating in public facilities, of which no one is talking and which represent a real slap to all those families that today are struggling to reach the end of the month and who do not know how to pay energy bills. <p> No mention of the Made in Italy and the incentives to re-launch the national production of the sector and also of the induced. We have completely forgotten the territories that have been affected by the earthquake. More could and had to be done for the implementation of centralized systems for production and distribution in the community. The laws should include some measures, but they have not done so for a long time and this is certainly a big problem. When the left was a social left, he said that there was an obvious problem of development model. He doesn't say anything anymore. The need to supply gas, especially during this period, certainly exists, but we cannot and must not make the same mistake that we have made with Russia and that Brothers of Italy has always remarked. Self-sufficiency is certainly important to us and it is clear that going to Qatar today, rather than to Algeria, serves. Self-sufficiency, however, involves a serious battle, and nothing is said about this in the provision before our examination. This decree-law does not even mention the energy transition plan. In conclusion, Mr President, we are also genuinely concerned about the superficiality with which such a sensitive matter is being dealt with. This is a situation, as I said before, which is certainly unsustainable and cannot and must not be put on the subject of Italian energy shortages on individual citizens and on individual families, because this would bring our businesses to their knees. The Italians look at you, they hear you. Definitely without strategy this country will have nothing. This is an empty decree-law, which, as I said before, lacks strategy and foresight. But the Italians are there, they hear you and they will surely take them into account.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5346688628196716, 0.46533113718032837]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> D'Ambrosio Lettieri (<PARTY>).

There is also another small anomaly, which I note without controversy but also to make the whole House understand better: the final report came to the Commission after the programme report. So this evening, in fact, the consuntiva report follows the programmatic one just because this is what happened from the point of view of the work. <p> It is true that some time has passed and that there is some delay, but it is nevertheless useful and important to make an evaluation, even ex post, of Italy's participation in the Union in order to be able to make a reasoning that allows us to indicate where to give continuity to the administrative action that has taken place, and where, if necessary, different guidelines must be given. I will give a brief explanation of how this document is composed. The report was drawn up in accordance with Article 13 of Law No 234 of 2012, and is divided into four parts. The first concerns the development of the European integration process; the second concerns Italy's participation in the implementation of the main sectoral policies; the third concerns Italy's participation in the Union's regulatory process, including, therefore, the issues of training and communication in European matters and the involvement of citizens, on which I will say something later; the fourth and final part describes cohesion policies, the development of financial flows and their use, as well as the results of the work carried out. Let us enter into the substance of the contents. The 2012 activity was dominated by economic and financial issues, with the aim of maintaining the stability of the euro area and making governance measures operational. It is clear and in the eyes of all that the particular cyclical moment and the structural crisis we are going through, which afflicts the European countries, has not yet allowed - it is useless to deny it - to produce visible effects. To be honest, even in the light of the news that today comes from Prime Minister Letta about the meeting in Europe, progress has been made, but not yet with the expected effects. The political commitment of the European Council of 28 and 29 June 2012 on economic growth, following the Government's strong impetus, has resulted in the Pact for Growth and Employment, which sets out in a comprehensive way the measures to relaunch the legislation on budgetary discipline. As regards the strengthening of the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union, the Italian side expressed its full support for a credible and ambitious reform process, also ensuring the involvement of the European Parliament and individual national parliaments. The prospects for the reform of economic and monetary union are based on four pillars: the establishment of an integrated financial framework (the so-called banking union); the new common fiscal and budgetary framework; the integration of economic policies; the legitimacy and democratic control of decision-making. As regards the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, the Italian position at the table was to improve the national net balance and on the other hand to have a global approach, based on the principles of efficient use of resources, solidarity and equity. (Brusio). Madam President, I'm sorry, but it's really hard to move on with this buzz. I understand the time and the fact that we are all tired, but making one last effort may be more useful to everyone. <p> I said, improve the net balance according to principles of solidarity and equity. This means recognising that there are in fact European public goods that can only be protected, or more efficiently, at EU level, by recognising that they are public goods. <p> Within the external dimension of the Union, the objective of strengthening the role of the European Union on the international stage has been predominant, and the need is to speak with one voice. In this regard, the UN Resolution on the strengthened status of the European Union in the sense of the UN General Assembly was a result for which the Italian Government fought. In the area of enlargement, the Government has worked to ensure proper recognition of the negotiating progress of the candidate countries, in particular for Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro. And we all welcomed Croatia's entry into the European Union a few days ago. On the subject of European neighbourhood policies, in particular with regard to the southern shore of the Mediterranean, Italy has stressed the need to provide adequate responses to the demands expressed by the countries in which the so-called Arab spring took place, from the point of view of political and economic support, but also to bring to completion privileged partnerships, with the establishment of new action plans with Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. As far as development cooperation is concerned, as my previous colleague said, Italy is the third contributor to the EU budget and the fourth contributor to the European Development Fund. Obviously, from this point of view, the initiative is specifically aimed at achieving Millennium Development Goals by 2015, with a particular focus on the historical challenge posed by the Arab Spring and the link between migration and development. Italy has strongly supported the action of High Representative Ashton to strengthen its trade relations with third countries. Also in commercial matters, and in view of the specific characteristics of the Italian production and industrial system, in order to protect its many excellences, the Government has successfully supported the need to reach balanced trade agreements, mutually beneficial and inspired by the principle of reciprocity, which pursue in an incisive and contextual manner both the commercial interests and the protection of the production system of the Member States. Therefore, not a closure and protection, but also the possibility of development. In this context, the Government has committed itself to achieving a compromise solution for the adoption of a regulation on the labelling of certain products from third countries (the so-called made in). Following the Commission's decision to withdraw the proposal, Italy asked the Commission to consider possible alternative solutions and to provide a detailed legal analysis to define a labelling scheme for consumer protection, market transparency and fair competition, which could not be regarded as a technical obstacle but, on the contrary, as a means of countering the fraudulent use of indications of European origin. It is clear that on some issues it has gone ahead, because this is a summary and, in the meantime, the action taken early in 2013. In the field of common security and defence policy, Italy was the fourth country to contribute to the fight against piracy through its Armed Forces in 2012. As far as home affairs are concerned, Italy has committed itself to issues related to illegal immigration, although, from this point of view, we must find strong resistance from the Member States not directly involved in the management of the external borders, especially those of the European Union's maritime borders. In the context of internal market policies, a review of the various existing disciplines has been undertaken to assess the compatibility of State aid with the Treaty rules. In the area of intellectual property, as regards the creation of the European patent (we talked a long time about this with the Minister, and then we were given indications). Italy and Spain had appealed to the Court of Justice on the way in which enhanced cooperation was used. But - this is not mentioned in the report, because it happened later, but of course we are still counting - on 16 April 2013 the Court expressed itself in the sense of rejecting this appeal. It is therefore necessary to consider whether to join the European patent system or how to move forward. In the context of social policies, the flagship initiative is the European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion. The Senate, in particular, is working and producing proposals, because this phenomenon particularly affects the child age group. In the field of education, efforts have been made to emphasise the role of education as an instrument of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the need to modernise higher education through five policy directives, on which national authorities and higher education institutions are working and confronting each other. As well as for culture, where much has been done to make the theme of cultural diversity and access to culture a predominant theme, also through the promotion of creative partnerships. In the tourism sector, it is interesting to see the creation of a European quality label, which aims to increase consumer confidence and safety in tourism products and to reward industry's efforts to offer quality services. On health, the issues addressed were not only the free movement of health care services, but also the serious cross-border threats to health, in other words how to move in such situations. On 11 October 2012, the Council approved a resolution on the European Consumer Agenda, which should therefore lead to a proposal for a regulation to resolve online disputes, with the aim of simplifying bureaucracy and leading to the settlement of online disputes. In my view, research and development is very interesting, because one of the limits that can be found is due to the lack of use of funding in some areas, which is due to a thousand reasons, some of which I will try to explain. In R &amp; D, the Horizon 2020 legislative package provides around €80 billion for 2014-2020 with the objective of achieving 3% of GDP by 2020 and enhancing the overall competitiveness of the Europe system. Environmental and energy policies are another of the very important areas on which work has been carried out, and this Parliament is also paying great attention, in order to promote the transition to a green economy in Europe and the adoption, in the pursuit of environmental policies, of an integrated approach with social and economic aspects, therefore no longer to watertight compartments but according to a more complex reasoning that uses substantially three pillars of reference (targets to 2020 emissions by 2050, improving environmental legislation and transition to a green economy), giving priority to the achievement of a single energy market so as to succeed in having the same treatment between regulation of renewable and traditional sources. I am beginning to conclude on the issue of cohesion policies, on which there is a great deal of work but on which there is also a new point. At the end of 2011, a reinforced action and cohesion plan was adopted in December 2012 with two further steps. It reprogrammed EUR 3.5 billion of Structural Funds managed by the Regions on four priorities: education and training, employment, railway infrastructure, digital agenda. Subsequently, in December, two phases were reconfirmed and launched that make available 2.9 billion, the first, and 5.7 billion, the other, for matters related to social inclusion, growth and competitiveness, with attention to the worsening of the youth situation (in fact we know how much Premier Letta has put the emphasis and is working on this), also to help businesses and work. In this respect, however, we must note that there is little access to these funds, rather than an important contribution to the European budget. This is partly due to excessive bureaucracy, partly to the issue related to the Internal Stability Pact (today we have read a positive news in this regard), on which the co-financing of the regions and bodies is burdened, and partly to the difficulty also in training and in the capacity to design. So on this point there is also an invitation to improve. In the summary report you will also find all the annexes that provide very detailed information.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5596566796302795, 0.44034329056739807]}, {'sequence': \"I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> THE RUSSIAN (<PARTY>).

Yes, exactly. As far as the double threshold is concerned, the Government points out that the EU directive does not clearly indicate whether this is possible. In a liberal state, anything that is not clearly forbidden is possible: we are in a liberal state, we are in this rule. The Government itself recognizes that in some countries - not minor, let me add - there is a double threshold for compulsory takeover bids, similar to that proposed by the motion of which I am the first signatory. Therefore, the point is whether, considering the particular nature of our country, its business system, its Stock Exchange and whatever else, it is suitable for our country to have the compulsory takeover bid regime or have, for example, the regime in force in the City of London. I believe that the structure of Italy is very different from that of the United Kingdom - better in some respects, worse in others - and therefore the double threshold system better intercepts the objective we have, namely the protection of savings.

This reduces the constraints on budgets, but it remains, however, a prior and final check on the final balance of competence. <p> It is expected that the tied multi-annual fund, intended for capital expenditure, will facilitate the planning of expenditure on the territory, encouraging its integration, leading to a higher level of investment. <p> For the local authorities, it is possible to reclassify any debt into constant shares, divided in three years. <p> There is also an attempt to change the mindset in this draft law in the way of tackling the problems of the levels of government of the territory, because, finally, with regard to the local authorities, rewards are also introduced and not only sanctions, as has been so far, among other things with an appreciable mechanism such as the one inserted during the work of the Budget Commission. <p> It has probably been noted that the levels of government closest to the people have suffered too many penalties and are those that in recent years have paid the highest price to balance public finances. <p> Too many sacrifices were sacrificed in the name of budget balances and too many financial cover obtained through cuts in transfers to Municipalities, Provinces and Regions, used in spending laws, whether they were financial laws or one of the many law decrees born with the intent to \"save\" Italy. <p> Wrong was also the idea of using the municipal tax instrument to allocate it - for more than 40% of the total resources - to the horizontal equalisation of other local authorities. <p> It should also be stressed that the only rules relating to the Internal Stability Pact and new accounting have resulted in municipal budget cuts of more than EUR 3 billion over the last five years. <p> The reality is that citizens really cannot do without the services provided on the territory to the community, because they are the ones materially closest to their needs. <p> The sacrifice - let me remind you - has been heavy, managing to reduce the total resources available to the Municipalities (climbed in the last five years of 3.8 billion, in the 8,000 Municipalities) and to reduce the volume of investments in their territories (climbed by 25% in the same period). <p> The Provinces, with the few resources left, can not even cope with the essential functions identified by the Delrio law, which, basically, has emptied them of competences. But there are, for example, two of these competences on which cutting has an important impact. <p> The first example I would like to make is the maintenance of roads: we see every day, in our former Provinces, how the mantle of controlled roads is reduced (130,000 kilometers of competence). <p> The second example concerns the high schools: 5,000 throughout Italy, more and more dilapidated, where the alarm for the collapses of plasters or false ceilings is recurrent. And it is really sad to think that even the solidity of a school building has become one of the parameters to consider for the choice of the school to be attended by our children. Just as sad to think that parents need to self - tax themselves to buy goods of primary benefit. <p> Well, because of the cuts, this year the Provinces will have a structural deficit of over EUR 1 billion. <p> Even regions, whose fundamental function should be to guarantee standards of quality services that are homogeneous, such as - for example - in the primary health sector, continue to have poor budgets. We all know that, unfortunately, they too have paid an important price in the name of public finance maneuvers. The same Regions now live in limbo until the celebration of the constitutional referendum that, if approved, would relegate them to marginal competences, having been reduced - as we know - their power as a result of the rewriting of Title V of the Constitution. On the contrary, economic resources are needed and, above all, multiannual planning of expenditure is needed to share investment. It is now essential to create a new framework of local public finance that fully involves and empowers all levels of government in the territory. It is essential to return to a framework of own resources that can guarantee a level of revenue that ensures the essential levels of services and services rendered on each territory. In return, however, the State must reduce the weight of the central tax levy. On the contrary, we read that the only positive data that arrive on the work of this Government are those relative to the performance of the revenues, which record the taxes charged to the Italians in continuous increase, despite the substantial stalemate of the GDP. Unfortunately, the new articulation of accounting laws affecting local and regional authorities also makes that uncertainty persist due to an annual planning framework (i.e. based on a too short period), which depends on annual budgetary laws and the consequent choices of derived finance. Moreover, at this time, it is also affected by the mistakes made in the economic policy choices made in recent years and by the too many bills of exchange.

In itself, the Commission seems willing to continue on the path initiated since 1962, so much so that President Juncker has said that the key words of the future in agriculture are \"simplification\" and \"modernisation\" while Commissioner Hogan has specified that the CAP will have to guarantee some basic rules in order to ensure a greater resilience of the markets, a more sustainable agricultural production and a better generational turnover. On the other hand, the CAP has been one of the main policies of the European common market and has made it possible to achieve the food independence of our continent. A goal that very often is taken for granted but that, in fact, so obvious is not. Moreover, although it accounts for less than 2% of GDP and 5% of employment in the European Union as a whole, it must be stressed that in absolute terms it is a sector that affects about 22 million farmers and creates 44 million jobs. There are many factors that can affect the choices to be made in defining the new programme for the years 2020-2026. Two, in particular, are, in my view, worthy of consideration: on the one hand, the United Kingdom\\'s exit from the Union; on the other hand, the economic policy choices of the American administration. At present, it is likely that the CAP will not be drastically downgraded, but it is realistic to expect a reduction in allocated resources and a consequent reduction in objectives and instruments compared to the recent past. Here comes the UK\\'s exit from the European Union. Beyond the long run and the impact it will have on the whole process of European integration, the exit of the United Kingdom will certainly have the effect of changing the balance of the Community budget. On the other hand, and at the same time, however, the absence of the United Kingdom is in favour of maintaining the Common Agricultural Policy, since the British prefer a markedly liberal approach and therefore contrary both to the intervention of support and regulation of prices, and to policies of protection of quality and origin, seen by them as a vulnus to the mechanisms of the free market. Potentially decisive for the future of the common agricultural policy will then be the economic policy choices made by the American administration of Trump, which has never made a mystery of its protectionist ideas. A return to protectionist policies would certainly not be positive for our country, because of the role that the agri-food sector has always played in the framework of our trade balance. Agricultural exports were crucial, so much so as to be a driving force in the years of the crisis, thanks to the fact that the sector has shown a strong competitiveness in high quality products. Protectionism would not be good either for the possible effects it would have on the internal market. It is true that customs duties make imports more expensive - for the benefit of domestic production - but they also have similar effects on our products, whose penetration into foreign markets would at this point be hindered. Overall, the general impression is that from these choices the trade balance would be severely penalized. In such a political and economic context, there is a clear need to intervene in the agricultural sector with well-targeted measures. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy must now, more than ever, respond to the new challenges that the recent Community and international landscape call us to face. The European Union, with measures that enhance the territorial distinctiveness of production, must reward the employment of rural areas by excluding unsustainable incomes and, on the contrary, by aiming at a system of qualitative rewards. The aim is to ensure that the country takes full advantage of the opportunities to support the agri-food sector offered by the Common Agricultural Policy, with particular reference to the greening component introduced as a premium system, in addition to the direct basic premium, for the environmental improvement service performed by the operator of the sector. How, then, can we intervene? What are the priorities? The time available to me is running out, so I try to make a brief list of the objectives that, in my opinion, need to be achieved. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen all measures that exclude income from the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy, rewarding against entrepreneurial and innovative capacity, in order to obtain high quality standards of products and producers in order to regain attractiveness on international markets. It is also necessary to implement the productions of national agri-food excellence by supporting and protecting the distinctiveness of the products made in Italy. It is necessary to create a widespread system of coordination of specific schemes in the agro-environmental field, thus enhancing the peculiarities of the individual territories and allowing the cooperation and aggregation of enterprises, in order to facilitate access to support measures for all the operators involved, many in our small country. Finally, we need to promote generational replacement - a battle that we have been supporting for a long time - through access to specific measures to support innovative entrepreneurship carried out by young people and women agricultural entrepreneurs. Finally, the system of direct payments, in particular those relating to the greening premium, which has proved to be incisive and difficult to implement in recent years, must be streamlined because of a cumbersome bureaucratic system and restrictive selective criteria. I hope that this is the direction we will be able to follow and support.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5110528469085693, 0.4889471232891083]}, {'sequence': 'I ask you to speak for an explanation of vote. <p> Mr Agussori (<PARTY>).

We call for these three leaders to implement the policies and synergies of coordination between the various departments, so not only that of agricultural food and forestry policies, not only that of the Mibac, but also that of the territory and the environment.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 10 June 1924 the Member and Secretary of the Socialist Party Matteotti left home on foot to go to Montecitorio. On the lungotevere, waiting for him, is stopped a car with some individuals on board, who push him into the car, rapendolo. The kidnapping first and then the murder of Matteotti have marked the political and institutional history of our country in an indelible way. From that date, fascism tightens the links, progressively bans freedom of thought and freedom of association and begins to become a regime, marking the beginning of the darkest period in Italy's history. The six articles of the bill for the celebrations of the hundredth anniversary of the death of Giacomo Matteotti are therefore a necessary tribute not only to the personal values that Matteotti paid dearly with the most precious good, life, but also to the values of freedom of thought and expression. Let us treasure it: today this freedom is often called into question. Giacomo Matteotti - as we all know - did not die in vain at all; this is demonstrated not only by this bill, but above all by the national collective memory. The task of the legislator, a hundred years after his premature death, is to increase public support for this collective memory and to support it in every form, so as to make more and more involved and aware of what is happening, especially young people and the whole of civil society. Yes, young people, with the acquisition of awareness, can be free to choose and participate actively in social life. The initiatives in this legislative proposal are a good way forward. The incessant political action taken by Matteotti against the dictatorship represents, now and then, all of us. The approval in the various institutional passages of this bill, which promotes and enhances the knowledge and study of Matteotti's works and thoughts, represents a strong signal of unity, which reiterates once again how our Republic inexorably and firmly condemns the fascist regime and all the abuses that were committed in that twenty years. Matteotti represents an indelible symbol of the fight against fascism and corruption in the Mossolini regime and represents the honor of free Italians who were slaughtered and imprisoned in the name of freedom and anti-fascistism. For all that is represented by the late Member and Socialist Secretary and in the name of his sacrifice, I therefore announce our Group's vote in favour of this bill.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7356508374214172, 0.264349102973938]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> CIRIANI (<PARTY>). Mr President, of course I attended the Conference of Leaders and listened to Senator Romeo's grievances. We have asked for sufficient time to deal with Senator Salvini's question. An acceleration of the times - in our opinion - was inappropriate as well as inconvenient from the political point of view, because it is however a matter of discussing a very delicate issue that concerns the political activity and the freedom of expression, thought and action of a Minister of the Republic, which takes more time not to be postponed to infinity, but to be examined. I also repeat here in this House what I said at the Conference of Heads of Group about the budgetary deviation. Minister D'Incà yesterday reported - which we had also read in the newspapers - that the government intends to propose a quantifiable deviation at a point of GDP or perhaps something more, equivalent to 15-20 billion euros. We, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, have always voted for deviations; we know that they need a qualified majority; we have guaranteed our vote, which has been decisive in the past; we have voted in a closed box, and then we have given the government the task of distributing resources. The balance of this act of confidence is extremely negative for us. So this time we simply ask the government and the majority to tell us first how they intend to use the 15-20 billion deviation that the Senate and the House of Deputies will have to vote from here a few days away. We don't think it's a strange, extravagant or lunar request. It seems to us a demand for responsibility, for sharing responsibility at a dramatic time for the country's life. The President-in-Office of the Council has often accused us of not wanting to talk to him. We reverse this logic: we offer him the opportunity to dialogue on the deviation, on the assumed figures. We simply want to know at least the macro-voices on which the Government intends to act to spend the 20 billion or as many as they will be, which will eventually make the overall deviation from the plans to the Government for about 100 billion euros. Ours, therefore, is a political act. The answers cannot be regulatory, as we heard yesterday from the Minister, and we expect a political response.

Today we are once again illustrating the bill of stability and the draft budget law after a month and in a partially changed picture both from an economic and an international political point of view. <p> In this month, the House of Deputies approved at second reading both draft laws that now pass to the Senate for its second reading and for the final green light. <p> I would like to take this opportunity not to thank in a non-formal way the staff of the Senate Offices, in particular that of the Budget Committee, for the availability and seriousness of the work carried out. Of course, I would like to thank the Senators of the majority, but also the opposition, who, while presenting a large number of amendments, have allowed a quick examination of them, focusing only on what they considered to be priorities. All of this enabled the reporters to vote in favour of the mandate last night; for this I thank, in a non-formal way, President Tonini for having believed in it. <p> Let us now examine the changes made to the House for general issues. It is up to me to examine the following issues: revenue and tax policies, measures for local authorities, public investment, labour and social security measures. While, after me, the other rapporteur will outline the following themes: banks, the safety and culture package, businesses and the Mezzogiorno, health and other interventions. <p> In a nutshell, because each of us had the opportunity to analyze the documents, I recall that on tax revenues and policies in the House was suspended the effectiveness of regional laws and municipal deliberations for the part where taxes and additional taxes attributed to the same territorial authorities increase, instead of prohibiting the resolution of such increases (as provided for by the original rule). Again in fiscal matters I remember: the reduction of the IRES rate from 27,5 to 24 percent, confirmed since 2017. <p> Among the novelties introduced during the examination in the Chamber sign: the assimilation to the incomes of employees of the income of the members of artisan cooperatives who have an employment relationship in an autonomous form, without prejudice to their social security treatment. <p> In addition, I would like to point out the extension to 2016 of the rules allowing the clearing of debit cards in favour of companies holding unprescribed commercial and professional claims, certain, liquid and due, accrued against the public administration. There are many other measures planned, which anyone who wishes to examine in the text of the report will be able to give in order that it may be annexed to the acts. I would just like to point out, with regard to real estate taxation, that some measures have been introduced in the House of Members\\' reading on the properties given in convenient use to children and parents, introducing a 50% reduction in the IMU tax base. The reduction of the IMU is foreseen for the second home given in comodato to the child, in the territory included within the municipality of residence also of the parent. <p> Among the other measures, also concerning real estate taxation, where the attention of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies has concentrated in order to facilitate in a particular way the topic of rents, I would like to remind you that, also following the agenda approved in the Senate, with favorable opinion of the Government, the Chamber of Deputies approved the measure of the rent due to the conductors who had benefited from the determination of law, for failure or partial registration of the contract - the so-called emergence of black in the rents - which is equal to the triple of the cadastral rent. In this way an important measure has been envisaged precisely for the benefit of the citizens who have had the courage to denounce the black in this area. <p> I would therefore like to explain the measures planned for local authorities. The package of measures for local authorities is indeed fed: although a specific decree-law on local authorities has already been adopted last summer, the Stability Act has considered that it still needs to do a number of very useful things, in my view, in favour of these bodies. One of the most qualifying points is precisely the part that concerns the galaxy of municipalities and provinces - now large-area entities - and metropolitan cities, which from 2008 to 2014 have endured a very important part of the fiscal consolidation effort. The cumulative amount at 2015 of the various maneuvers that have followed is worth 19.3 billion euros, equal to 25% of the total expenditure of these institutions. Therefore, the contribution to the reduction of public expenditure has been very important. On the system of local authorities, in particular, we started from a condition of great difficulty, also due to the laws of stability of previous periods. The municipalities could be said to be satisfied with the intervention, which for the first time recognizes them the complete refreshment of the abolition of the IMU, but the law of stability for 2016 marks a real turning point for the local authorities of our country: for the first time there are no cuts in transfers, nor tightening of the constraints of public finance and, indeed, in 2016 the era of the internal pact of stability ends and we move to the more rational principle of budgetary balance on reinforced competence. The House of Deputies has made a significant contribution to the coverage and limitation of cuts for the Provinces, which was a subject strongly emphasized in the Senate, both during the examination in the Commission and in the interventions carried out in the Assembly, as has been strongly expressed on the topic of the Regions. Here too, for those who are interested, I leave the written text of the report to the documents, which explores these issues. <p> I would like to say a few more words about public investment: as far as public investment is concerned, in addition to the measures to accelerate spending on European funds and the use of the investment clause, which is 0.3% of GDP, and therefore a little less than EUR 5 billion, with a leverage effect of total expenditure \"freed\" of 11.8 billion in 2016, particularly in the Mezzogiorno areas, the innovations in public investment have the same positive sign as the manoeuvre as a whole. <p> The path towards a first form of financial autonomy of ANAS is also strengthened. Meanwhile, the innovations that have entered the maneuver since the beginning are consolidated: for the first time, after seven, eight years, the appropriations for the infrastructure sector are growing; the funds for ANAS and Ferrovie dello Stato are stabilized for the three-year period; the internal stability pact for the municipalities (at least partially) is exceeded, which had severely curbed local investments over the last five years. <p> On the measures for work and pension, I would like to remind you that in this law of stability has been previewed the advance from 2017 to 2016 of the no tax area for pensioners. This is a strong initiative and affects about 6 million citizens who have a pension income of up to 8,000 euros. It is also planned to extend to the whole of 2016 the protection in the event of unemployment for precarious workers, the so-called DIS-COLL. The rule expired this year and this is an intervention to protect the weakest workers. The inclusion of maternity periods for the purpose of counting farm productivity premiums is recognised. This manoeuvre, in addition to the other measures we had taken in the Senate, shows attention to the whole range of workers who deal with the issue of motherhood. I will stop here, but I would ask you to hand over the full text of my report to the Presidency. I leave the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs Chiavaroli, whom I particularly thank for the work she has done together with seriousness and commitment, but also with affection and mutual esteem. <p> I call the rapporteur, Senator Chiavaroli.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6384350657463074, 0.361564964056015]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> THE COURT (<PARTY>). Madam President, with this intervention I continue today a relay with which, together with many senators and many senators, we remember every woman who is killed at the hands of a man to whom she is or has been linked by a loving relationship. We will do so as long as it is necessary to remind Parliament and our country of the urgency of combating violence against women. On the night between 23 and 24 December, in Bee, in the province of Verbania, Alessia Partesana, twenty-nine years old, was killed by her partner with a knife. <p> She wanted to leave me, and I couldn't stand it. That's what the murderer said. The couple had a five-year-old girl. <p> In the night between 26 and 27 December, in Parma, Gabriella Altamirano, 45 years old, was killed by stabbing, along with Kelly Manici, transsexual and drag queen, by her partner, who had left after he had initiated her into prostitution by living the proceeds of that activity. Gabriella had repeatedly denounced him for persecuting acts and several times called 112 because he was lurking under the house. This is how the 33 women we remember in this relay, started only on June 30, 2016. Many of them killed after a separation, even just announced. Also as a reaction to a recent separation, a further feminicide attempt took place on January 9, in Messina, where Ylenia Bonavera, twenty-two years old, was set on fire by her boyfriend and is now in hospital with her body devastated by burns. Ylenia did not report her partner, who indeed tried to exonerate despite the overwhelming evidence. Unfortunately a very usual scheme, the same for which yesterday a twenty-three-year-old Albanian girl went to the emergency room in Budrio, in the metropolitan area of Bologna, with a wrist broken by her partner, but refused to report. According to L'ISTAT, a woman is killed in Italy every 2.2 days. 46.3% of the women killed die at the hands of their partner or former partner. The severity of sexual and physical violence has increased. There are also growing cases of assisted violence, that odious psychological mistreatment that consists in letting minors witness acts of violence against an adult who, in most cases, is their own mother. It's not just about the news. There are profound cultural reasons for violence against women and acts of feminicide. There is, in our country, a male issue, understood as an inability of many men to handle the relationship with the other gender in a correct, equal and non-violent way. Let us therefore make our appeal with conviction. It is an appeal to the Government, waiting for the delegation to equal opportunities to be reassigned: the directing booth monitors the application, the merits and the limits of Law No 119 of 2013 to combat gender violence, approved by this Parliament in implementation of the Convention in Istanbul and, above all, give full and accurate implementation to the anti-violence plan. It is an appeal to the media: stop justifying, even with the wrong language, the murderers and to blame women.

A work that assigns a central role to Italy and qualifies our Peninsula as a European logistic platform aimed towards the Mediterranean basin and towards the East. In this sense, the infrastructure connections of High Speed and High Capacity are fundamental and cannot be separated from the construction of the bridge over the Strait of Messina.

With a reasoning with which I will not bore you now, he claims that the Jews embodied modernity and technique and were killed by their own technique. He therefore supports this idea and is convinced that annihilation was wanted by the Jews themselves - who, as many say, certainly inducing unhealthy opinions, they went to seek it - but he is a great philosopher, who told us huge things about the fundamental problems of existence, of the individual and of the community, about time, death and being. To get to us, this is not only a problem of history, data and recognition, but it is a deeper question: it is philosophy that tells us the root of this problem, which does not happen to come back continuously. In fact, it is difficult to distinguish opinions from the consequences of opinions and this is said by a philosopher who has been the protagonist of this dimension. <p> In order to reach us and our little one, it must be said that all this is very difficult, so much so that we, historians and scholars present here at the Senate, who belong to the scientific communities that study these issues, have been very opposed to the previous version of the bill and we are very opposed to a version that condemns negationism as a crime of opinion in criminal proceedings. In this case, however, in the text of the law we are discussing, this very difficult distinction between opinion and incitement, between facts and interpretation of facts, between judgment and fact, between judgment and consequence of this judgment, is resolved in a sufficiently effective way - although with much ambiguity, because probably it should not be made even in principle - because there is a clear distinction between opinion and incitement, as supported by the interventions of those who preceded me. <p> The opinion, in fact, can never be suppressed, but the denial - and here we come to the case - must be stigmatized not by the law, but by the scientific community, because it is a fake historical. It will therefore be the academic colleagues and their research that will tell us how false this is. Believe me, mine is not an intellectual scum in defense of the corporation, because we are deeply convinced that the only effective way to really fight a historical falsity is to refute it iuxta\\'s own principle, with data, documents and factual evidence. It is a scientific fact and not an opinion and is therefore not punishable by law, but it is to be condemned in terms of profession, communication and transmission. It is a vital fact to tell our young people that those who claim that this did not happen say something wrong, because it is not true. And that\\'s not wrong, because it\\'s his opinion: opinion is something else. Think of Heidegger, so much so that the scientific community every decade wonders about this intriguing, complicated and really very disturbing figure. On the contrary, history has its own reality; there is or is not a fact: those who deny it are to be stigmatized and their scientific work is to be condemned. Incitement, on the other hand, must be punished. It is a third level: there is opinion, there is denial and, finally, there is incitement. This is what pursues the text in our examination, which contains decisive improvements: it has also been said by Senator Malan that in the text absolutely does not foresee a crime of opinion, but only an aggravating article 3 of the so-called \"Royal-Left Law,\" in the case of an incitement that however is pronounced, public, verifiable and has consequences. Therefore, we will vote for the text with conviction, despite the perplexities I have said before and which we have always supported. I conclude by saying that we are convinced - I am also speaking on behalf of other historians, but I am sure that I am convinced - that we can never incriminate an opinion, but that the same freedom of expression - see the case \"Je suis Charlie\" - also has limits. Even freedom of expression has limits, which, as Senator Manconi said well, are respecting the opinions and people, beliefs and religions of others. So we remain strongly opposed to incriminating even the fake historian: I would like to reassure Senators Scilipoti Isgrò and Giovanardi. Here it is not about putting the historians De Felice and Nolte in jail, because Ernst Nolte, who is the one who has measured himself most with the theme of the Shoah (and not only with fascism), has never denied existence. Here we enter a whole other field, which is the revisionist one, which says: let\\'s try to understand why it happened. Nolte wondered why it happened. So, we leave this to historians. With these clarifications, I would like to express my thanks for the work done by the Commission and the rapporteur and to announce that we will vote in favour of this new text of the measure.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.511867880821228, 0.48813214898109436]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, we are dealing with the conversion into law of the Decree-Law on urgent measures to counter the economic and humanitarian effects of the crisis in Ukraine. <p> In order to face this international crisis, a series of provisions are introduced by the Decree-Law in question to meet the exceptional requirements, in particular with regard to the performance of production activities, to contain energy prices on the Italian market and to face the situation of instability in the functioning of the national natural gas system resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. <p> Although the work in the Commission has been very intensive, tiring and full-bodied, more than 1,421 amendments have been produced by all the parliamentary groups and the League is satisfied, although not entirely, because more can be done. The work of our Group has been strong and important on a number of themes. We are a little disappointed by small signals that the Government could perhaps have given us about situations that seem small to us, but they are great for the various sectors. I am referring, for example, to the amendment which allocated very small funds to rehabilitation centres for disabled people with heated pools, used for physiotherapy and rehabilitation in the water; then there was our amendment against the cutting of the military, which was rejected, after a negative opinion from the Government. The reduction expected from the next 1° July of another 1,000 units from the Safe Roads operation is a serious damage to our country. As a League we will continue to fight for the Forces of Order and for the safety of the Italians. <p> In addition, the government could accept our amendment on extra profits to banks. We had strongly asked to expand the audience of the subjects called to pay the extraordinary contribution against the expensive bills. A concrete act of social redistribution was needed, increasing the taxation of extra-profits from 10% to 25% and extending it also to banks and financial intermediaries operating in the energy sector. If our amendment had been approved and accepted by the Government, it would have guaranteed revenues to the State and, consequently, the distribution of profits to millions of Italians, but also to cover the burdens to remove the distorting effects contained in the norm that penalize several companies. It would have been a gesture of social justice, a fair and necessary measure, to reduce the costs of expensive energy and to help families and businesses. <p> It is also true, however, that other small, great signs have arrived: thanks to the work done by the Lega Group with the rest of the majority and the insistence of our party, amendments have been accepted which at this time of serious post-Pandemic crisis really help our citizens. I am referring in particular - I thank Giorgio Bergesio and the Group - to the payment of fines from milk quotas, a very important measure. In addition, we can be satisfied with the approval of the amendment in defence of our companies with regard to the exports of scrap, with which the number of subjects obliged to transmit the export information to the Ministry of Economic Development, which can carry out a clear monitoring for all the companies that want to export, including those foreign ones. This is an initiative that serves to protect our productive realities from unfair market practices that would put in serious difficulty entire sectors, from construction to steelmaking, with heavy consequences for our companies and social and employment repercussions. Another concrete response to entrepreneurs who still struggle to recover from the health and economic emergency and who forcefully ask us not to be left alone in the post-Pandemic restart is the approval of the amendment that allows - for example - bars, restaurants and public establishments in general, already considered suitable, to continue, after payment, to enjoy outdoor tables and chairs throughout the summer season, without having to produce any new request and without the municipal authorities being able to deny it. This will also serve to lighten the municipal administrations themselves, as well as the development of our activities. We are proud of these and many other results, the result of negotiations with the majority of the Government, on which I am sure we could not have affected by remaining in opposition. Mr President, I would like to conclude my speech on an issue which as a Puglia citizen interests me directly and which concerns me very much, which concerns the former Ilva. It is not possible - I say this to the comrades of this wide-ranging government path - for the <PARTY> to support an initiative of the Movimento 5 Stars, trying to vote on that amendment on the former Ilva in the Commission, which fortunately has not passed, with the opposite opinion from the Ministry of Economic Development, only for pure demagogy, as it appears clear from the press news of the last hours, yesterday and today. It is clear that the delays in reclamation operations - it should be clarified - in the areas of the former Ilva can be attributed to those who have the competence to do so, i.e. to the administration of the Commission, which we did not put. The funds for this are there, the money for the reclamations is there, but the commissioners are not carrying out the project and everything goes very slowly. The rule approved in the decree has been widely discussed with the Presidency of the Council and with all parties of this majority present in the direction booth. The objective of the Government and Minister Giorgetti is to accelerate the process of decarbonisation, which is necessary in the interest of the city of Taranto, aimed at efficient productivity of a key sector of our economy, especially in this historical period, with the increase of prices and the lack of raw materials.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5225576758384705, 0.47744232416152954]}, {'sequence': 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the approval of this delegation law, the Senate gives the green light today to an epochal intervention, expected by many, too many years, of general reform of the world of disability. <p> The implementation of the decrees provided for in this delegation law will bring innumerable benefits, first of all in terms of simplification. <p> There will be a unique subject that will prevent the disabled from crossing the current bureaucratic jungle between evaluations and examinations of various bodies and subjects that often duplicate, overlap and generate gaps of skills that appear to be made specifically to make those who, on the other hand, should simply see recognized their own right. This also means having the possibility of full access to services, services and financial facilities that allow greater autonomy and independence, personalised paths to allow real inclusion, which must pass, where possible, from full integration into the world of work, which must not be a para-assistant measure, but the instrument to achieve the full dignity of the individual, making him feel an active part of society. <p> The approach of living must also be completely revised in order to allow, through ad hoc solutions, the widest self-sufficiency possible. It is a broad and ambitious project, but it is a path that we must begin to undertake, even if we realize that the goal will not be in the immediate future: today we must have the foresight of the one who sows the plant of dates, knowing that whoever reaps the fruit will come after him. All this happens under the strong thrust of this Government, that, never like others, is paying attention to the harsh reality of this category, thanks only - this must be recognized and proudly emphasized - to the strong demand of the League to establish an ad hoc Ministry, that could coordinate in a cross-cutting way the policies in this matter, and above all to the thickness and experience of Minister Erika Stefani, who in ten months has been able to put to the ground as many measures as they had never seen in the last ten years. <p> It is to her that, through the strong applause of the Lega Group, thanks go to all the disabled. <p> There have been many results already achieved and it is right to mention them: the increase in the fund for non self-sufficiency, the fund for inclusion, the recognition of the language of Italian signs and the language of tactile signs, the disability card, the increases to the universal single allowance for those who have disabled children and the restoration of invalidity allowances following the decision of INPS that cut pensions to partially disabled persons employed. Also in this budget law there will be important interventions required by the Lega Group for Autism, for the deaf, for the Italian Union of Czechs, as well as additional funds available to the Ministry led by Senator Stefani. Also on the occasion of the emergency Covid there was a great effort on the part of the Minister to pay attention to the last: I remember the vaccination priority for people with disabilities, for their family caregivers, the possibility for assistants and companions of patients with disabilities to support them in the emergency room and hospital, the teaching in presence for pupils with disabilities also in the red zone, the distribution of transparent masks for people with auditory disabilities and the establishment of an ad hoc fund to ensure free swabs for so-called fragile people who cannot vaccinate. It is also commendable that efforts are being made in favour of fragile workers and temporarily unfit workers, even though in this case we must have incomprehensible resistance from the INPS and other ministries. Even today, in the middle of the fourth round of the epidemic, we record that the necessary protections are not guaranteed with automatism, but are once again denied in the decrees and postponed to a possible corrective during the parliamentary conversion. I am referring specifically to exemption from work and absence equivalent to hospitalization, with no impact on compensation, which allows those who cannot work in smart working to put health before work. Paying the sickness allowance costs, but if the Ministry of Economy and Finance finds the funds to restore those who risk failing, it must also find them for those who risk dying. <p> I shall begin with the conclusion, Mr President. It must also be said to INPS, with a clear rule of law, that, even if the limit of the contractual compensation limit is reached, the sickness allowance must continue to be paid to those who, by decision of the doctor, cannot work. In the discussion of the draft budget law, it is possible that an amendment of the Lega Group will be accepted which provides for at least one additional month, and this is important, because it defines the principle that that limit is not an insurmountable dogma, but that is not enough. It is unacceptable for the government to tell fragile workers to stay home to protect themselves from the Covid-19, but to starve, because they will not be given a euro. <p> I conclude by recalling Voltaire, who said: The degree of civilization of a country is measured by observing its prisons. Well, there is no worse prison, that is, limitation of freedom, than the one that faces the disabled person who is subject to it, not for his own fault, but by choice of destiny. It is to them that we have to look every day, if we want to continue to call ourselves a civilized country.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5455466508865356, 0.45445334911346436]}, {'sequence': 'Madam President, I would like to make a number of general and complementary comments to what I have said in general, rather than specifically explaining the amendments, if you will allow me to do so. <p> We have tabled, yes, some amendments, which - I repeat - are complementary to the work done, considering that it can be considered serious, since we have written it in the Commission with four hands with the Government, and that thanks to it we can give that abbreviation that our country is waiting for with regard to this important reform. It is a challenge, which we have accepted both from a technical point of view, given that we have entered a great deal of detail and from a political point of view, and we have done so by virtue of the fact that at last this time - and I remember that this is a delegated law - the Government has taken a fairly cautious approach to Parliament and the Commission. We have received a proposal from the Government, on which we have made our views, and, in fact, we have taken a blank sheet, we have tried to rewrite it according to the sensitivity of the Commission and Parliament. I therefore believe that a good job can be judged. <p> The amendments we have tabled are complementary to all this work. Clearly, what we are dealing with is so articulated and complex that at this moment perhaps it is not the perfection of the writing that we must seek, but the fact of changing diametrically vision regarding the code of procurement and getting our country out of that juniper that we have known in these long years. From there, the need to make the objective law arose: in fact, if the ordinary procedure fails to do the works, it is necessary to achieve them by an extraordinary procedure, according to the objective law, which in spirit we share and shared. <p> It is obvious that, with this challenge, we want to ensure that our country too can be approved of the normal practices in force on the face of the earth, that is, there are no procedures, unless they are emergent, due to contingent facts, and that therefore making contracts and works falls within the normal procedure of a civil country. It is a great challenge that we have accepted in writing this text, which - as I will then say more redundantly in an explanation of vote - is not a blank delegation that we give to the Government, but a confidence that we give to ourselves and to Parliament. That, from my point of view, is crucial. <p> There are many novelties in the guidelines of this delegation law that we expect to reread when we pass the ball to the government, to see what it wants to do. We are absolutely not hostile to overcoming the objective law, but I would like to differentiate the fact that there are strategic works and the objective law, which I allow to separate. The strategic works remain, which are certainly not exclusively identifiable in the 25 works we have seen in the DEF (among which, I remember it for those who have little memory, there is also the Florence tramway, which is definitely not a strategic work of the country, and we could talk about it for a week). <p> Having said that, the strategic works necessary for a country must be lucky enough to be realized in a civil country in which the ordinary procedure for their realization has a streamlined and productive path. It\\'s definitely a challenge. <p> The amendments submitted to abundantiam aim to further improve, if possible, this delegation law. Everyone can then exquisite and make his own considerations: we would miss it, we are in democracy. To find a pretext for not sharing this passage would have been simple, but I think it is reductive to try to trivialize the meticulous and scrupulous work done in the Commission by pointing out a possible weakness of this document and therefore presenting amendments that might appear \"pretestuous.\" Ours has been a cautious, soft and yet collaborative attitude; it is understood that from now on we will watch, as we have done in the drafting of the text and as we will do in its implementation, so that there really are the conditions to be able to give our country something that is not projected into the future but extremely contemporary, because unfortunately at this moment we are not even able to live the contemporaryity in the matter of the necessity of a reform of the code of contracts. Synthesizing, the hope is that in our country there really is the possibility of not seeing any more things on which we have fought extremely hard. It is not possible, aspect attributable exclusively to our country, that works worth 500 million euros have reserves above the auction base; it is something that is not found anywhere on the face of the earth, so much so that in Italy the companies and the design studios have more lawyers than technicians. We are the only country that has the reservists, the ones who make reservations before they even start the work. In this respect, I have tabled an amendment, which will not be accepted because it is perhaps somewhat provocative, aimed at creating a bad list of companies using the reserve system in a scientific way, regardless of the project. With regard to the use of the integrated contract - also this prerogative of our country because, except for really specific cases for very particular realizations from the point of technical and technological visa, it does not exist anywhere else on the face of the earth or at least does not exist in Europe or in the Western countries - we of the League have proposed immediately a moderate use if not the abolition. This request was in most cases shared by all the audits in the Commission, first and foremost by Canton. It was not shared by the CEO of the State Railways and this says a lot, from my point of view, about the failure of certain works realized with integrated contract. In fact, I believe that the first act that any kind of administration must do in approaching a work, strategic or not, is to have the certainty of where it wants to go and what it wants to do. Therefore, the first mandate to be conferred is the one relative to the design so that it can decide, until the last nail, all the characteristics of the work and put in condition who will compete to its realization of being able to do it in equal weapons: whoever will be better will finally win the execution of the work, as happens in the rest of the world. I conclude by saying that this is an important step forward for the country, a challenge. I am certain that there are the characteristics and conditions to overcome this challenge, if the papers will be written by the government in the right way. We have in the country technicians and companies that achieve excellent results abroad, which they cannot do in our country for the juniper that we all know. This is the anomaly and also what leaves the bitter in everyone\\'s mouth. This is an important challenge which, from a political point of view, we share - and I thank the Deputy Minister once again, as well as the President of the Commission and the rapporteur - for their cooperation. We managed, for once, to keep a little \\'distant the excessively invasive approach that the Government always has on these occasions. Let\\'s hope we\\'re not disappointed in a second phase, and we\\'ll see about that. We don\\'t want to make any lawsuits. As far as the amendments are concerned, I reserve the right to speak in an explanation of vote on those that are particularly dear to us and relate to specific areas. In this case too, we will try to continue to have a dialogue with both the rapporteur and the Government and, in any case, also on these amendments, a peaceful and constructive approach, as has been the case up to now.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5398229360580444, 0.4601770341396332]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> NACCARATE (<PARTY> (GS, PPI, FV, M, MBI)).

I would like to point out what Senators Malan and Bernini said in particular about the need for an approach aimed at prevention rather than bureaucratisation, and avoid an increase in penalties which will then remain only on paper. <p> The second major orientation that emerges and on which there is ample sharing is related to responsibility, which requires - as has been said - \"understanding\" and \"sensitisation\" the important expressions used that have pinpointed to me. In this regard, I would particularly like to thank the contribution of Senators Favero, Puppato, Rizzotti, Fasiolo and Senator Liuzzi. <p> The last, but not least, director deals with the ways in which the measure takes action, which follow the basic cultural choice that inspires it.

Of course, we all want to devote more resources.

If the turnover is more than 30% of the total, these social cooperatives are considered as workers in social agriculture in proportion to the same agricultural turnover. <p> Social farming activities can be carried out in association with cooperatives, social enterprises, social promotion associations, public entities, cooperation bodies, voluntary organisations, social promotion associations and bodies, foundations, patronage bodies and other private entities. <p> The legislation provides that social farming activities are carried out in collaboration with social and health services, obviously combining with the intervention of the Regions, which have already independently provided for their own regulations. Some regions, such as Veneto, Liguria, Tuscany, Marche, Abruzzo and Campania, have already begun to operate, although in an experimental way, with fairly satisfactory results, and all this goes to intersect with the regulation of the third sector and the law n. 381 of 1991, which every year transfers to the Regions numerous financing. <p> The public authorities responsible for the territory, within the framework of the planning of their functions in relation to agricultural and social activities, promote, without new or increased burdens for public finance, integrated policies between enterprises, agricultural producers and local institutions in order to develop social agriculture. <p> The measure comes to the Chamber perhaps a little late (it took almost twelve months) and in the meantime, as I said before, some regions have already begun to act with the same principles. It is also expected that the regions will adapt their own provisions on the planning of the local network of services and services, in order to allow the recognition of social agriculture operators in the agencies in charge. The monitoring and evaluation of services and services shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the body responsible for recognition. The approved undertakings shall be entered in an official list established at regional level. <p> On the other hand, the part relating to the replacement power of the State vis-à-vis the Regions in the event of non-compliance with the recognition of operators has been deleted. Social farming operators may set up producer organisations (OPs) for social farming products. <p> The buildings or portions of rural buildings already existing in the fund, intended by farmers for the exercise of social farming activities, maintain the recognition of rurality. The regions can promote the use of the existing real estate in accordance with the typological, architectural and landscape-environmental characteristics of the places. <p> As regards support measures, public institutions managing school and hospital canteens have the right to include as priority criteria for the award of supply invitations, the origin of agri-food products from social agricultural operators, in compliance with the legislation on rationalization and containment of expenditure on goods and services. The municipalities will have to define the appropriate arrangements for the presence and exploitation of products from social agriculture in public areas. <p> In the context of the operations of alienation and leasing of agricultural property land and of those belonging to territorial and non-territorial public authorities, priority criteria are laid down to facilitate the establishment and development of social farming activities, including by using property and land confiscated under the Code of Anti-Mafia Laws and Prevention Measures. Local and regional authorities may also grant real estate confiscated from organised crime free of charge to workers in social agriculture. <p> The regions, within the framework of rural development plans, can promote the implementation of programmes aimed at the development of the multifunctionality of agricultural enterprises, with particular regard to the practices of integrated territorial planning and the development of social agriculture. To this end, the Regions themselves promote partnerships between stakeholders in the social agriculture sector.

It was a great opportunity to know, to laugh, to have fun. It is in RAI that are born characters that have made the history of our country: directors, singers, actors, comedians. And also politics, with television, was able to reach the homes of all Italians. There is no doubt that television and RAI have played a decisive role in the growth and formation of Italians, in the construction of the cultural and social identity of our country, just as there is no doubt if we say that today RAI has lost that character, that role and that function. <p> Today we live in the society of communication; we are flooded with information, messages, images, but with this we no longer have a widespread culture; we have no more aware citizens, indeed we risk having only so many individuals who struggle to recognize themselves in a community and in a common project. The RAI must therefore contribute to this. To make it change, we politicians must change understanding that today our country needs a state-of-the-art and innovative public service and that is why we must free RAI from that Italian evil called bureaucracy and division. In other words, we need more politics with capitals and no less politics and more willingness to change. The revolution is a perpetual challenge to the incrustations of habit, to the insolence of uncontested authority, to the complacent idolization of self and of the myths imposed by the media. For this reason the revolution must be a normal event, a continuous renewal, a continuous reflection and do, discuss and do. So said a man, a teacher who has made public service important to millions of people. I'm talking about Master Manzi. Let me quote him to tell us what our work in the Commission has also been. <p> The revolution - I said - must be a normal event, a reflection and a do, discuss and do. Doing is not only a Renzian verb, as is also believed, irritating about it in recent times. To make is the principle and the cornerstone of any will to change. The Commission's work has produced the text that we are bringing to this House today. It is a fact that is largely shared or largely shared; it is not wrong; it is a fact that wants to remember and bring back the purpose and reason of a public radio and television service. It is part of this policy of doing the reform of the management of the company, giving autonomy and power to the CEO, who will have to be at that professional and personal level to make us remember and not regret illustrious characters who have made the RAI great. One of them is our colleague Sergio Zavoli. <p> AIROLA (<PARTY>). Renzi should listen to him, too. CANTINI (<PARTY>). We are talking about a policy that seeks, as we did in the Commission, to find solutions together so that the future board of directors can be, in the sum of the nominations made by Chamber, Senate, Government and RAI workers, qualified and plural; of a policy that puts in a transparent way the curricula of the aspiring directors to the public judgment because the curricula submitted to the Chamber and the Senate will be published on the institutional sites and made public before the beginning of the analysis, as happens following the approval of one of mine and other amendments incorporated in the bill today in the Chamber, which establishes clear norms of incompatibility for the managing director. However, with this measure we make only a first part of the work that is needed, but it was urgent that, since the renewal of the board already expired, we could give the sign of discontinuity and above all outline the lines of the reform project. Today we approve the rules for the renewal of governance, but we will have to proceed with the reform of the canon and the new service contract. Professor Pitruzzella, President of the Competition and Market Authority during the hearing in our Commission, reminded us that technological developments and the development of on-line audiovisual services, although very important, have not yet affected the centrality of the traditional television sector both from the social and economic point of view: television is in fact still the largest Italian publishing industry, the first medium for advertising investments and the time devoted by the public to television grows. The sector still plays a central role in the content production chain. Given this scenario, it is therefore important to start with giving RAI a new clear guide, recognized, transparent, efficient and responsible: a head company able to make decisions, but also to be called to respond to it and to offer a new editorial language that is accessible to everyone, but at the same time content and growth, and that is the fly of our production model and the beauty of our territory, the products that are born from this territory and the enchantment that every corner of our country offers. We need an editorial line that is not redundant and that can eliminate unnecessary costs, even with the reform of newspapers. This is a necessary modernisation, aimed at adapting the production model of news to international standards, with fewer publications and more production of reports and documentaries. Of course, the proof if we succeed in our aim will be given when we can verify the quality of the new appointments and the validity of the project, the mission and the new schedule. But it will depend on us if we can be a result of what we have written in this provision. In fact, in the bill we are debating here, the profile to which we must inspire appointments is clear: professionals, qualified women and men, the best. The mission we are inspired by is also clear. If we can live up to the challenge that we launch with this bill to ourselves and to the country, we will have started and partially implemented another of the strategic reforms for the country. For this reason too, we have sought convergence in the Commission. In fact, we are stubbornly convinced that important reforms must be done together, because only in this way will we be able to get our country out of this sad phase in which the search for confrontation, hatred and the desire to destroy compared to the will to build still prevail. We need to build and on this we should use all our energies, divide, discuss and confront ourselves, to build a RAI that can make culture and does not adapt to the lowest levels of the market, but that is, through its own productions, an engine of excellence and a point of rebirth of the economy of our country, through that cultural market that is so much talked about, but sometimes without objective results. The RAI can and must acquire a new international profile, including through the production of English-language programs and the creation of a cultural channel to match the best European examples. With this measure we take another step towards change. So much remains to be done - we don't hide it - but I am sure that only from this and other labors will be born the country we want: a better country, more just and modern, avant-garde and example in Europe and in the world\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5436399579048157, 0.45636001229286194]}, {'sequence': \"I'm asking to talk. <p> TOCCI (<PARTY>).

My proposal has received a great deal of attention from so many groups in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I would also like to appeal here to the rapporteurs: before we finally reject this solution, let us give ourselves a pause for reflection. There will be a moment in the work of this House when we will have to settle other issues such as budgetary competence and - as has already been said - the referendum. So we can reach a stage in our work where we will have to solve a number of problems. I believe that this group of amendments on the list deserves a pause for reflection.

We know that this document comes from the Count Government and unfortunately the new Executive must also carry it forward. We know perfectly well that there have been errors on the part of the Count Government. Even Merkel, a few days ago, took a step back on lockdown and apologized, because the same would really create a great discomfort to both citizens and the economy. We know that it is not enough just to talk about recovery: we need projects and ideas, but we do not see many of them; we see them especially from the Italians, who are participating in this debate with great fatigue. The Plan, as I said before, was set up by the Count Government; Parliament is doing a great deal of work, especially because it is an old and outdated document, which will not be presented. That is why we of Brothers of Italy would have wanted a completely different approach and full involvement of Parliament, also to present improvements through the amendments. With regard specifically to environmental aspects, it would certainly be a key point to work on changing the superbonus to 110%, because we know that it is certainly an important instrument that families and companies would like to draw on. Unfortunately, however, bureaucracy restricts a lot in this respect. Just to give concrete examples, of the 6 billion euros of deduction planned, only 340 million euros were used in deduction to finance only 3,100 interventions throughout the country. They are certainly very low numbers, whereas in theory - I repeat - this instrument could have a total effect on the economy of about EUR 21 billion. We must work - it is fundamental and one of the issues that I have addressed in the Environment Commission and which I continue to stress - especially to simplify the various administrative procedures. This is a prodromic condition for the success of all initiatives aimed at relaunching the economy. Another proposal is the extension of the 110% superbonus to other types of property that are currently excluded. I am thinking above all of tourism, therefore of the accommodation facilities and hotels that are currently suffering. We must extend and, above all, grant an extension, not least because there are very few 15 months. Unforgivable - and I conclude, Mr President - is the absence in this recovery plan of youth policies. Let me say that Spain, France and Portugal have certainly done well: a perspective must be given and a government must also have foresight in helping our young people.

We believe, also for the reasons expressed by the illustrious colleagues, much more prepared than I, also from the legal point of view, that the inclusion of an adverb as \"publicly\" in point (a), therefore in the case of propaganda, can be a way to rebalance the scope of a rule that already in itself raises doubts that had led to the raising of exceptions of unconstitutionality. We believe that, in order for an offence to be envisaged, there must still be a danger in the conduct, otherwise we would not understand how to protect the interest and the good underlying that rule. We do not believe that any hypothesis should be found, which could possibly become the case of crimes of opinion, if they are not actually suitable to produce a negative event, regardless of the possible legal classification between offences of concrete or abstract danger.

President Gasparri himself recalled that this is not a new affair. There have been conflicts of attribution and there is a very large jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court in this matter that cannot be overlooked. We know that, from the point of view of the Constitutional Court, the rules, as they are at the present time, allow the use of indisputability only when the statements, the non-moenia statements, are a coherent and punctual amplification of the parliamentary activity carried out within the Community. That's a fact. Therefore, at a time when the rapporteur, whoever he is, has to deal with such a matter, he cannot ignore this framework. I would also add that there would be a space which depends very much on the time when the extra-moenia declaration takes place, i.e. there is the possibility that a Member of Parliament will make an extra-moenia intervention, followed very shortly by a statement in Parliament. In that case, it may well still be invoked for inindacability. The situation we are faced with - as I have already said in the report - is completely different and therefore, dutylessly, anyone who is in the position of rapporteur in cases such as these can only take account of these rules. Then there is another problem, which is what Senator Giarrusso posed. I also believe that the rapporteur should reply. Senator Giarrusso, today, tells us - in a somewhat intimidating way - that he has no intention of escaping the judgment of merit and, in essence, reiterates and amplifies further - this time in Parliament and, therefore, we are faced with a parliamentary activity covered, this yes, by indisputability - the the thesis that has been attributed to him by the plaintiff. Actually in that of Agira exists, that is, a contiguity - as he explained - between a politician and a prejudiced person who has Mafia relatives and who intends to claim these statements of his in court, seat in which he even declares himself convinced that the counterpart will be condemned. Now, it is clear that it is inevitable to ask Senator Giarrusso some very simple questions from the rapporteur's point of view. I am not referring so much to why on 24 May 2015 he claimed that his conduct before the judge was unassailable. So far we have come to understand that this was a political response, in the sense that the indisputability before the judge was excavated because Senator Giarrusso was trying to make the case visible at national level. And, therefore, it was a kind of political fora, a search for attention on the case of Agira pursued through the possibility of coming to Junta and to the House to tell us what he said. And I have nothing to complain about. On the level, however, of the formal correctness and the relations that we must have to the Senate and between us within the Junta, of which Giarrusso is an authoritative member, the basic question is as follows: why on 23 June 2016 and 29 June 2016 was a job imposed on the Junta and myself to verify whether the reasons for the insinacability invoked by Giarrusso were founded or not from the legal and formal point of view? This is an important question, because the use of the Senate of the Republic as a sounding board to highlight the situation of a territory through the instrument of dragging into the Junta of a case that, among other things, dates back to 2015 - so, we add that the plaintiff has been standing still for more than a year - is already at the limits, but it is not up to me to judge it. But if the problem really is what Senator Giarrusso tells us today in this Chamber, I ask why we have been checking for more than a month when and if he had submitted his question and whether or not it was a reason for inconvenience; when and if there was actually a criminal of his rights to express his political views; when and if there was an indeterminate or non-absence of the recipient of his accusations that he has clearly explained to us in this House today that it seems that there is not. This is something I cannot fail to highlight in my reply, because otherwise, Mr President, we all seem crazy. It would seem that I have carried out a report because I have invented, or the House has invented, a request for inconvenience, which has been motivated, albeit - as we have tried to demonstrate in the report - in a way that is not founded from our point of view. It is as if someone today accused the Junta of misreading the intentions that are clear, written and signed. Even with regard to the question, no one said, accusing Mr Giarrusso, that it was a shield to avoid the problem of the complaint. It is Senator Giarrusso who used it as a shield explaining that he had presented it eight months later, otherwise I would never have cited it; I would never have allowed myself and never thought of it. <p> Now, it's not like this isn't allowed. For God's sake, President, everyone can reconsider and there's nothing strange about it. On the other hand, there is no case law from this point of view. There is only the New Testament that forgave St Peter because, three times, he denied Jesus. In short, in this case, there is at least the number three as the limit of the possibility of denying something or rethinking it. <p> The basic problem, however, is that I believe, also because of the quality of the work that we have to do in Junta, that it would be more appropriate for the future than, if it is considered more important to go to trial - and in my opinion rightly, because, despite the tones, it can also convince me the speech of Senator Giarrusso - because it could become a forum for political confrontation, and you are ready to challenge that process, you are sure to get out of it with your own reinforced reasons and with your own political opponent exposed in a feat that tried to hide, well, let's do it. But let us do so, at least on 27 May 2015, and not a year later in this House, without even saying so in Junta, among other things also out of respect for him. <p> I don't think the Senate election committee can know from a press release that a person wants to give up the indisputability on the very day he's discussing it. It is a formal matter, but the form is substance when it comes to a delicate organism such as that which we are called to manage on behalf of the Senate of the Republic. And it is an issue that I inevitably had to highlight in my reply.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.576705813407898, 0.42329418659210205]}, {'sequence': 'I\\'m asking to talk. <p> Mr Spilabotte (<PARTY>). Madam President, I am sorry to do this on the eve of the International Women\\'s Day, but I have to make a public complaint, because on the Facebook profile of a certain Mario Salieri, one of the most popular directors of the porn genre, appeared the promotion of a movie entitled \"La Ciociara\" freely inspired, according to the same director, to the movie by De Sica \"La Ciociara\". The latter had as protagonist Sofia Loren and denounced the so-called Moroccans of the years 1943-1944, during the Second World War, when as many as 60,000 people, among men, women and children, suffered unprecedented violence (which in some cases also led to death) by Moroccan soldiers framed in French troops, who, as a prize for having freed these lands from Nazi-fascistism, had had had freedom of action for fifty hours on our territory. This freedom of action has become the raid of these territories and group violence against men, women and children. This director, Mario Salieri, offers a free version inspired by De Sica\\'s film and the star actress, Roberta Gemma, is an undisputed star of the hard genre. I would therefore ask for attention from this House. I will also present an act of inspection union. I also call for urgent action by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism, through its Directorate-General for Cinema, which has the capacity to approve the dissemination, impose prohibitions or deny the nullity if the cinematographic work is an offense to vice-costume. I think that, in addition to the insult to the good costume, this film work - if that can be defined - is really offended to the memory and suffering of so many people, often forgotten, who have had to suffer this barbarism.

Signor Presidente, a nome del Gruppo di Forza Italia esprimo cordoglio per le famiglie delle otto vittime dell'alluvione di Livorno e solidarietà alla città. Sono particolarmente legato a Livorno, perché mi ha eletto per dieci anni consigliere comunale e per cinque anni consigliere provinciale. Quando una famiglia, la tipica famiglia italiana, composta dal padre, dalla madre, dai nonni e i nipotini, vive in simbiosi e, all'improvviso, un'onda di acqua e di fango la travolge e lascia in vita solo una bambina di due anni e la nonna, oppure, in una coppia, la moglie muore lasciando il marito, è chiaro che dobbiamo interrogarci sul perché. Per fortuna, le Assicurazioni Generali hanno fatto un gesto, che io ho apprezzato e che credo apprezzino anche tutti i colleghi: penseranno loro al futuro della bambina, dal momento che sia il nonno che il padre avevano una agenzia di assicurazioni delle Generali. Vi è l'elemento imponderabile? Io non lo so. So però che Livorno non ha un fiume; Livorno ha un canale ben arginato, un canale risalente al tempo dei Medici, e che mai ha creato problemi. Se accade un disastro come quello che è avvenuto, è evidente che la colpa è dell'uomo. Però non mi è mai piaciuto il fatto che, quando avvengono tragedie di questa natura, prima di pensare a soccorrere coloro che sono in difficoltà o di cercare di ripristinare la città alle sue regole, si cerchi di trovare il colpevole. Ci sarà tempo e modo per capire se ci sono delle responsabilità, e non è compito nostro, ma sarà compito della magistratura poterlo acclarare. Quel torrente è stato interrato settanta o ottanta anni fa; mi sembra addirittura che sia stato interrato nel 1933. Ora, andare a cercare le responsabilità, com'è accaduto in questi giorni, tra l'amministrazione comunale di Livorno e la Regione, del perché si è interrato quel torrente, quando sono ormai settanta o ottanta anni che questo è avvenuto, mi pare eccessivo. Certamente, l'amministrazione comunale di Livorno non ha lo stesso colore politico che ho io, ma non me la sento di scagliarmici addosso, come è avvenuto. Soprattutto, auspico che il Governo centrale, la Regione e il Comune lavorino insieme a Livorno, per poter ripristinare la città nella sua regolamentazione. Credo che l'uomo debba interrogarsi - lo diceva il senatore Filippi poc'anzi - su quello che è avvenuto e su quello che ha fatto in questi anni: ha usato il territorio a fini di lucro, senza pensare alle future generazioni. È arrivato il momento di pensare alle future generazioni e di investire per cercare di rimettere in sicurezza il territorio. So che il costo è molto elevato, perché ci sono stati degli studi da parte di tecnici, che hanno rilevato cifre grandissime. Però, se non incominciamo mai a riportare il territorio alle sue origini, certamente non riusciremo a risolvere il problema. Se è necessario, dobbiamo avere anche il coraggio di abbattere ciò che è stato costruito, per cercare di evitare che in futuro accadano disastri come quello che è accaduto in questi giorni nella città di Livorno.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5030770301818848, 0.49692296981811523]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> DI MAGGIO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, approfitto della richiesta del senatore Buccarella, condivisa da tutti i Capigruppo, per sottoporre alla sua attenzione un'istanza che avrei voluto sollevare a fine seduta, come era ovvio. Credo però che l'argomento sia talmente importante che valga la pena fare ora qualche riflessione. A me appaiono quasi paradossalmente vere le affermazioni che fa il sottosegretario Delrio quando dice che la politica in questi fatti non c'entra nulla, ma questo denuncia drammaticamente che, forse, venti anni sono passati invano, se è vero, com'è vero, che ci ritroviamo facce e volti già noti venti anni fa. Credo quindi sia molto importante - e faccio istanza proprio a lei, signor Presidente - che il Presidente del Consiglio venga a riferire in Aula al Senato.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6691734194755554, 0.3308265507221222]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, nel mio intervento in sede di discussione generale in prima lettura sul presente provvedimento ho sottolineato il valore positivo del testo legislativo in discussione, in quanto esso volta pagina rispetto a una lunga stagione in cui il diritto del lavoro ha considerato il lavoro autonomo come ontologicamente estraneo al proprio campo di applicazione. Ora finalmente si riconosce in modo organico e compiuto che anche il lavoro autonomo ha alcune esigenze di sicurezza, delle quali però non si può fare carico il contratto tra le parti, salvo correggere le eventuali distorsioni derivanti da situazioni di sostanziale dipendenza economica del prestatore dal committente o da abusi di posizione dominante da parte di quest'ultimo. Questa è l'impostazione che correttamente ritroviamo negli articoli 2 e 3 del testo legislativo. Le esigenze di sicurezza del prestatore autonomo possono e devono essere soddisfatte nell'ambito del rapporto previdenziale, come molto opportunamente fa il provvedimento. <p> Su questa prima parte della nuova legge - per non ripetermi - mi limito a richiamare tutto quanto dissi nel mio intervento del 26 ottobre scorso. Anche sulla seconda parte, costituita dagli articoli da 18 a 23, richiamo le notazioni positive svolte in quell'intervento che si limitano però all'apprezzamento della ratio legis, dell'intendimento del legislatore di promuovere e favorire quello che ora viene battezzato come lavoro agile, ovvero il rapporto di lavoro nel quale, per un determinato segmento temporale, la prestazione lavorativa è esentata dal vincolo contrattuale del coordinamento spazio-temporale, assumendo così i tratti essenziali della prestazione autonoma, pur nell'ambito di un rapporto di lavoro subordinato. Tuttavia, visto che sia in questo ramo del Parlamento sia nell'altro su questo disegno di legge si è registrata una convergenza insolitamente ampia di consensi, mi sia consentito proporre su questa seconda parte del testo alcune osservazioni critiche, una voce fuori dal coro, senza che questo venga considerato come una nota stonata. È chiaro che queste osservazioni non mirano a ulteriori emendamenti, poiché si vuole che il testo diventi finalmente legge ed è utile che lo diventi subito. È utile però anche che queste osservazioni restino a verbale a futura memoria, in modo che se l'esperienza pratica dell'applicazione della nuova legge mostrerà che esse hanno qualche fondamento, se ne possa tener conto negli aggiustamenti legislativi futuri. Il rischio che vedo è che le disposizioni contenute in questo Capo II del provvedimento possano ridurre quella agilità del rapporto che, invece, vogliamo promuovere e preservare. Non si preserva l'agilità se l'accordo tra le parti viene appesantito con costi di transazione superflui che mi sembra nascano da una nostra perniciosa tendenza, soprattutto in materia di lavoro, all'iper-regolazione, alla legificazione di ogni aspetto del rapporto, anche laddove non ve ne é alcuna utilità, salvo che per i burocrati ministeriali (per costoro, infatti, la complicazione legislativa comporta la funzione di sacerdoti dei sacri misteri, cioè di interpreti del testo legislativo mediante circolari) e per il ceto dei consulenti del lavoro e degli avvocati, cui peraltro appartengo, la cui opera è resa indispensabile. Costituisce un aumento ingiustificato dei costi di transazione anche la sola ipertrofia delle norme, la produzione di testi legislativi nei quali si dicono in venti righe cose che si potrebbero dire in una riga sola o, peggio, si ripete inutilmente con parole nuove ciò che è già detto da una norma generale in riferimento a una fattispecie particolare. Ogni regola enunciata nuovamente dà luogo allo sforzo di stuoli di interpreti per individuare ogni minima differenza di significato ravvisabile in ciascuna parola nuova utilizzata dal legislatore. Del resto, anche soltanto l'aggiunta di quelle venti righe per non dire nulla di nuovo costituisce un aggravio dei costi di transazione perché obbliga tutti gli operatori a ingaggiare un consulente per accertare che la nuova legge non disponga una variazione della vecchia disciplina. Faccio solo due esempi. In mesi di discussione su questo nuovo testo legislativo non ho trovato nessuno che mi abbia spiegato cosa aggiunga l'articolo 21 alla disciplina generale applicabile a tutti i rapporti di lavoro in materia di controllo a distanza. Queste sette righe di Gazzetta Ufficiale che aggiungiamo sono del tutto inutili e dannose per la complicazione della vita dei cittadini che esse di per sé comportano per il solo fatto di essere state aggiunte. Allo stesso modo, in mesi di discussione su questo testo non ho trovato nessuno che mi abbia spiegato cosa aggiunga l'articolo 22 alla tutela generale della sicurezza del lavoratore subordinato. Qui addirittura si tratta di quindici righe del tutto inutili. Sempre sul piano della chiarezza e leggibilità del testo legislativo, non si fa apprezzare positivamente che in questo disegno di legge alla Camera sia stato inserito l'articolo 24, contenente una norma in materia di contribuzione previdenziale per le assistenti domiciliari di Bolzano. Si può capire che la nuova legge imponga alle parti l'obbligo di stipulare l'accordo concernente il lavoro agile in forma scritta, anche se questo configura un piccolo peso in più rispetto all'ordinamento oggi vigente, che invece ne consente la pattuizione orale. Se si impone pure che l'atto scritto definisca - cito testualmente - «le riforme di esercizio del potere direttivo del datore di lavoro ed agli strumenti utilizzati dal lavoratore» (articolo 19) e poi si aggiunge che lo stesso atto scritto deve individuare «le condotte, connesse all'esecuzione della prestazione lavorativa all'esterno dei locali aziendali, che danno luogo all'applicazione di sanzioni disciplinari» (articolo 21, comma 2), si costringe, senza che ce ne sia alcuna ragione apprezzabile, l'impresa di dimensione piccole e medie ad avvalersi di un consulente o di un avvocato per adempiere questo obbligo. Al consulente e all'avvocato, per altro, si dà una gatta da pelare non facile. Cosa si potrà mai scrivere di utile nella pattuizione scritta circa le forme di esercizio del potere direttivo nei confronti del lavoratore agile oppure circa le condotte particolari che possono dare luogo a sanzioni disciplinari quando la prestazione è destinata a svolgersi al di fuori del perimetro aziendale e nei tempi liberamente decisi dal lavoratore? Ma soprattutto, quale funzione protettiva possono mai, in concreto, svolgere queste due disposizioni? Qual è l'abuso del potere direttivo del datore o del potere disciplinare che si vuole prevenire? Se non rispondiamo a queste domande, vuol dire che queste norme non hanno una ragione d'essere e allora sarebbe meglio non averle inserite. Se quel primo vincolo formale, di cui all'articolo 22, appare scarsamente utile e potenzialmente dannoso, ancor più questo va detto dell'obbligo di consegnare al lavoratore e al rappresentante dei lavoratori, con cadenza almeno annuale (ogni anno bisogna ripetere questo duplice adempimento scritto), un'informativa scritta nella quale siano individuati i rischi generali e quelli specifici connessi alla particolare modalità di esecuzione del rapporto di lavoro (articolo 22): siamo al chiodo nella panchina del parco, a cui accennava il relatore poco fa. Qui osservo che, nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi di lavoro agile, che già esiste e già è praticato in numerosissimi casi nel nostro tessuto produttivo, questa forma di lavoro consiste in un'attività svolta mediante computer collegato a distanza con l'organizzazione aziendale, dove il rischio aggiuntivo, il rischio differenziale del lavorare a casa propria, o dove si preferisce, è francamente assai poco apprezzabile. Altro sarebbe il discorso se questo obbligo venisse imposto soltanto là dove vi sia uno specifico rischio aggiuntivo, quindi non in qualsiasi caso e addirittura ripetendo l'adempimento ogni anno, ma solo nei casi in cui, per le sostanze utilizzate o per il macchinario che deve essere utilizzato, che peraltro è materia più da lavoro a domicilio del secolo scorso che da lavoro agile del XXI secolo, nello svolgimento dell'attività fuori dai locali aziendali sia ravvisabile un concreto rischio aggiuntivo. Nel mio intervento dell'ottobre scorso osservavo su questo punto come l'errore che qui si ripete sia lo stesso che ha caratterizzato gran parte della legislazione del lavoro nella stagione passata. In ogni occasione promettiamo agli operatori economici semplificazione normativa e abolizione degli adempimenti inutili, ma poi, nel momento in cui vogliamo promuovere il lavoro agile, cadiamo nella tentazione della iper-regolazione e dell'imposizione di adempimenti che non sussistono in alcun ordinamento che noi conosciamo, parlo di ordinamenti stranieri. E questo deve farci pensare, perché quando un adempimento aggiuntivo esiste soltanto in Italia e in un nessun altro Paese, neppure in quelli molto più avanzati del nostro sul terreno del lavoro agile, un campanello d'allarme deve scattare e avvertirci che forse stiamo peccando per l'ennesima volta di ipertrofia normativa.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5221550464630127, 0.4778449237346649]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, sarò brevissima nell'illustrare gli altri punti che sono stato oggetto di modifiche alla Camera. <p> Sulle banche dirò pochissimo, perché il dibattito sul disegno di legge di stabilità è stato quasi totalmente assorbito da questo tema. Mi limito a ricordare che alla Camera esso ha recepito il decreto-legge n. 183 del 2015 riguardante le procedure di risoluzione della Cassa di risparmio di Ferrara, della Banca Marche, della Banca popolare dell'Etruria e della Cassa di risparmio della Provincia di Chieti. <p> La Camera ha introdotto su questa materia un fondo di solidarietà in favore degli obbligazionisti subordinati fino ad un massimo di 100 milioni di euro che sarà alimentato dal fondo interbancario di tutela dei depositi, per la gestione del quale deve essere emanato un regolamento e un decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, sentite le Commissioni competenti, per la scelta degli arbitri. <p> In materia finanziaria è stata introdotta un'altra norma importante che riguarda l'albo unico dei consulenti finanziari, che recepisce un disegno di legge approvato qui al Senato. <p> Un altro tema importante inserito alla Camera riguarda la sicurezza, per la quale sono stati destinati 2,6 miliardi, attraverso la costituzione di un fondo per il potenziamento degli interventi e delle dotazioni strumentali in materia di cibernetica e sicurezza informatica per 150 milioni di euro; un fondo per l'ammodernamento delle dotazioni strumentali e le attrezzature delle forze di polizia e dei vigili del fuoco per 50 milioni di euro; un fondo per gli interventi straordinari di difesa e sicurezza nazionale in relazione alla minaccia terroristica per 245 milioni di euro, oltre al bonus degli 80 euro mensili per i componenti delle Forze dell'ordine. È stata introdotta un'altra misura, che è passata sotto silenzio, ma che ritengo importante, sempre in tema di sicurezza, che riguarda i cittadini nelle proprie case: è stato inserito un credito d'imposta di 15 milioni di euro per gli impianti di videosorveglianza e allarme che i cittadini inseriranno nelle proprie case. Se ne è parlato poco, ma credo sia una questione importante. Interventi importanti sono stati previsti anche sul fronte della cultura: ricordo velocemente la card per i giovani che compiono diciotto anni che potranno utilizzare per le attività culturali, ma anche il fondo di 500 milioni di euro per la rigenerazione e riqualificazione delle aree degradate. Per quanto riguarda in generale la cultura, l'istruzione e l'università, sono state potenziate le misure che erano già state introdotte al Senato; in particolare è stata potenziata la misura che riguarda le borse di studio, alla quale sono stati aggiunti 50 milioni di euro, e sono state potenziate anche le misure che riguardano chi studia nei conservatori, perché è stato inserito un bonus, una tantum, di 1.000 euro per chi acquista strumenti musicali. Una parte consistente degli interventi riguarda il Sud, un tema del quale abbiamo tanto discusso in Senato e che avevamo idealmente affidato ai colleghi della Camera. Con soddisfazione possiamo dire che il dibattito affrontato in questa sede è stato interamente recepito in quanto la Camera ha inserito un credito d'imposta pluriennale, dal 1° gennaio 2016 al 31 dicembre 2019, per gli investimenti delle imprese delle otto Regioni del Sud, differenziato a secondo della dimensione delle imprese: il 20 per cento per piccole imprese, il 15 per le medie e il 10 per le grandi, con un tetto anche in questo caso differenziato a seconda delle dimensioni dell'impresa. È stato recepito anche l'incremento della decontribuzione per i nuovi assunti al Sud, che però partirà dal 2017, in quanto sarà subordinato sia all'autorizzazione della Commissione europea sia alla ricognizione delle risorse disponibili nel Fondo di rotazione per l'attuazione delle politiche comunitarie. Mi piace sottolineare che una particolare attenzione nell'ambito di questa misura, qualora siano disponibili le risorse, sarà destinata all'assunzione delle donne. Anche questo è un tema che molto poco ha riguardato il dibattito, ma credo sia una misura molto importante. Sempre al Mezzogiorno è stato destinato il 20 per cento del Fondo di garanzia per le piccole e medie imprese alle imprese delle Regioni del Sud. Quindi questa parte della manovra che noi avevamo affidato al lavoro della Camera ha trovato piena attuazione e grande soddisfazione da parte nostra. Importanti misure sono state varate anche per le imprese in generale, nonostante il rinvio della riduzione dell'IRES al 2017. È stato introdotto un Fondo di 300 milioni per il credito all'esportazione e all'internazionalizzazione del sistema produttivo. È stata accolta anche un'altra misura, della quale avevamo parlato tanto anche qui al Senato, che riguarda la deducibilità dell'IRAP sui lavoratori stagionali. La Camera infatti ha introdotto la deducibilità al 70 per cento del costo del lavoro per i lavoratori stagionali impiegati almeno centoventi giorni all'anno. Crediamo che questa sia una misura molto importante per le imprese che utilizzano i lavoratori stagionali, soprattutto per quelle del turismo. Sono state inserite importanti norme che riguardano la sanità, con lo sblocco delle assunzioni per l'emergenza orari di lavoro e turni di riposo di medici ed infermieri, e nuove norme sulla responsabilità professionale del personale sanitario, nonché norme importanti nel campo del sociale, come ad esempio la card per gli sconti alle famiglie con almeno tre figli minori. Un'altra parte di norme rilevanti, che poco ha riguardato il dibattito ma che riteniamo significative, riguardano i giochi. È stato inserito un aumento del prelievo erariale unico, che passa dal 15 al 17,5 per cento; è stata prevista una riduzione delle quote delle vincite; inoltre, non saranno consentiti apparecchi aggiuntivi, se non in sostituzione di quelli già esistenti. Poi ci sono importanti novità che riguardano la produzione normativa nel settore, che dovrà essere oggetto di accordo nella Conferenza Stato-Regioni ed enti locali. C'è, infine, la norma più importante che riguarda il divieto assoluto di pubblicità sulle TV generaliste dalle ore 7 alle ore 22. Ci sono state tante altre norme importanti. Ne cito una per tutte che riguarda il canone RAI. Avevamo destinato una parte dell' extra gettito a ulteriori esenzioni del canone per i pensionati e non eravamo riusciti a fare una norma sulle TV locali, che invece è stata accolta alla Camera. Per brevità di dibattito, visto che i tempi stringono, mi limito alle misure più importanti e anch'io mi associo ai ringraziamenti della collega per il lavoro svolto in prima e in seconda lettura perché, grazie all'impegno di tutti, degli Uffici, del Presidente, dei colleghi di maggioranza e, soprattutto, di quelli dell'opposizione, siamo riusciti ad arrivare in Aula con il mandato. Riguardo al disegno di legge di bilancio, che anche è all'oggetto del voto dell'Aula, chiedo alla Presidenza di poter integrare il mio intervento con una breve relazione, da allegare al Resoconto della seduta, in quanto alla Camera è stata oggetto di poche e limitatissime modifiche. <p> Ha facoltà di parlare il relatore di minoranza.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7719579935073853, 0.22804202139377594]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, membri del Governo, onorevoli colleghi della maggioranza ma, soprattutto, dell'opposizione, che - ricordiamolo - all'unanimità votò a favore della norma da cui sono nate le mozioni odierne <p> : evidentemente un lampo di lucidità nel buio che vi attanaglia da alcuni mesi! <p> Sono felice di poter illustrare questa mozione perché dovrebbe finalmente porre fine a tutte le polemiche strumentali che in questi ultimi due mesi abbiamo dovuto leggere e ascoltare (in realtà, leggende più che polemiche, ma è lo stesso). <p> Il bando periferie prevedeva il finanziamento di 120 progetti di Comuni capoluogo di Provincia e Città metropolitane. Erano divisi in 24 progetti per cui era stato messo a disposizione un primo stanziamento di fondi e 96 progetti che avrebbero dovuto beneficiare di un secondo stanziamento. Su questi 96 progetti voi avete creato il problema che noi abbiamo risolto: la realtà è molto semplice. <p> Qualora non vi fosse ancora ben chiaro - ma è evidente che lo sapete, altrimenti non avreste votato a favore della norma - dopo i primi 0,5 miliardi stanziati per i 24 progetti iniziali, il Governo Gentiloni Silveri ha tentato goffamente di stanziare successivamente ulteriori 1,6 miliardi circa per i restanti 96 progetti, dimenticandosi, però, di effettuare tutti i passaggi previsti per legge. <p> La Corte costituzionale, tuttavia, non si è distratta, a differenza vostra, e ha giudicato incostituzionale l'utilizzo del fondo stanziato senza un preventivo accordo con le Regioni, come prevedeva la legge. Come se non bastasse, sono poi pervenute alla Presidenza del Consiglio dei ministri numerose istanze per rimodulare gli interventi poiché in realtà molti dei progetti non erano ancora di fatto pronti. Il Parlamento, poi, è dovuto così intervenire con un duplice scopo: in primo luogo, per rimodulare il finanziamento, utilizzando i fondi questa volta per una finalità consentita dalla legge e andando a sbloccare gli avanzi di bilancio per tutti gli 8000 Comuni italiani; in secondo luogo, per differire al 2020 l'efficacia delle convenzioni concluse. In pratica, abbiamo riparato ai danni ereditati e abbiamo legiferato per il bene di tutti i territori. <p> Andando oltre - ma qui andiamo ad aggiungere un nuovo concetto e non vorremmo che gli sforzi fossero un po' troppo intensi da parte della minoranza - va ricordato che le convenzioni non sono state bloccate, dunque le amministrazioni potrebbero procedere anche in autonomia con proprie risorse o in altro modo, per esempio accendendo forme di un'anticipazione finanziaria. Ad ogni modo, dando seguito a quanto già promesso dal premier Conte durante l'incontro ricordato, avvenuto l'11 settembre con l'Associazione nazionale dei Comuni italiani (ANCI), con la mozione al nostro esame il Senato impegna il Governo su due fronti. In primo luogo a prevedere specifiche misure nella legge di bilancio 2018 volte a garantire, compatibilmente con una più efficace allocazione delle risorse a disposizione, soluzioni idonee alle istanze degli enti locali interessati, aggiudicatari degli interventi finanziati a valere sul fondo periferie. In secondo luogo a provvedere al rimborso delle spese per gli interventi già sostenuti dagli enti territoriali che hanno sottoscritto le convenzioni. Il tutto con buona pace di ANCI e delle strumentalizzazioni.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5358880162239075, 0.46411189436912537]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, penso che in venti minuti di intervento si possano dire molte cose importanti, perché importante è la materia che è allo studio del Parlamento e di quest'Aula da tantissimi anni. Si cerca infatti di riformare ogni volta un'importante realtà come la RAI e si fanno sempre delle riforme che, per così dire, lasciano indietro un pezzo, cioè non sono complete. Si fanno delle riforme che testimoniano come vi sia un interesse di parte in chi le propone, in chi le sostiene, in chi le approva, in chi le porta in quest'Aula mostrandone gli aspetti positivi, naturalmente per lui e per la maggioranza. <p> C'è chi, invece, volendo ragionare a 360 gradi, guarda a tutti gli aspetti, compresi i lati critici, compreso il rovescio della medaglia, che pongono bene in evidenza quali sono i limiti di questo modo di lavorare, di queste riforma, di questo modo di procedere nelle riforme che non porta mai ad un risultato compiuto, ma che costringe di tanto in tanto - ogni lustro - ad intervenire per fare la riforma delle riforme - così viene annunciata - che poi si rivela essere null'altro che un'ulteriore riformetta, che quindi necessiterà tra cinque anni di un'ulteriore modifica e di un'ulteriore discussione, impegnando nuovamente il Parlamento per dire che effettivamente aveva ragione qualcuno che intervenne qualche anno prima e che ben si poteva allora già intervenire, ma non lo si fece. È quindi probabile che tra qualche anno accadrà proprio questo e rivedremo un film - passatemi il termine, visto che stiamo parlando di RAI - che stiamo vivendo quest'oggi e che chi già da un po' di tempo è presente nelle Aule parlamentari ha visto anche in altre occasioni. <p> Qualche giorno fa parlavo con una persona che è nata quando non esisteva ancora la televisione, ma esisteva solo un canale radiofonico, quindi non era sicuramente un bel periodo quanto alla possibilità di fare informazione democratica, quell'informazione che serviva effettivamente alla gente. Io credo che lo spirito di questa riforma ci debba far riflettere, perché non vorrei poi ritrovarmi ad avere una RAI che, con uno o più canali, abbia lo stesso indirizzo, lo stesso modo di agire, volto cioè a dare informazioni in modo univoco, a dare informazioni canalizzate, a fare un certo tipo di spettacolo e di intrattenimento che nel suo profondo contiene comunque dei messaggi che vengono lanciati e che vanno nella direzione di dare un chiaro sostegno politico a qualcuno, perché si tornerebbe così ad un sistema d'informazione sicuramente non democratico, che nessuno vuole. <p> La stessa RAI, così come viene riformata, con il tipo di board che si prefigura, con la previsione di una modalità di gestione operativa posta in capo a soggetti che si ipotizza oggi in questa discussione poter essere dei grandi manager, dovrebbe subire una trasformazione radicale, perché viene sottratta al controllo dei partiti, in quanto viene fatta una selezione finalmente basata sulle capacità, sul merito, su quello che dovrebbe essere naturale nella gestione di una grande azienda come questa, ma io temo che alla fine accadrà quello che è successo finora: qualche decennio fa si diceva, quando si trattava di pubbliche assunzioni, che bisognava assumere, su tre persone, un socialista, un democristiano e uno bravo; in RAI, invece, un socialista, un democristiano, un comunista ed uno bravo. Credo che, alla fine, magari cambiando le definizioni, chi dovrà gestire la RAI difficilmente potrà sottrarsi a questa logica, perché comunque la scelta fatta sul suo nome sarà di una parte politica e gli indirizzi e le pressioni non mancheranno. Quindi il merito, le capacità vere, la possibilità di emergere e di valorizzare un grande patrimonio di esperienze che abbiamo nel mondo della comunicazione, dell'intrattenimento, del fare televisione e film nel nostro Paese, andranno nuovamente disperse. Questa sarebbe un'ulteriore grave responsabilità che ci si assumerebbe votando a favore di questo provvedimento. Noi abbiamo posto tante questioni all'attenzione dell'Aula, a cominciare - per essere terra terra - da quella del canone, che ci viene imposto per guardare una televisione anche se non si vuole guardare quei canali; va pagato anche se, come nelle mie zone di montagna, non si vedono i canali della RAI; ci viene imposto anche se per vedere quei canali bisogna pagare per l'installazione di una parabola e di un ricevitore. Sembra quasi che si voglia fare l'evasore se si afferma che ci si rifugia sul canale di un altro operatore televisivo perché quelli della RAI non si possono vedere. Ci sono dei cittadini che vengono perseguitati perché non hanno pagato il canone RAI magari per una giusta protesta, perché non concordano con le modalità di informazione che vengono portate avanti, o semplicemente perché per loro è impossibile poter godere di quel tipo di servizio. Eppure non si fanno distinzioni. Questa è un'altra delle questioni che dovrebbero essere affrontate e che dovrebbero portare tutti a riflettere sulla necessità di mantenere in piedi uno strumento, un mezzo di finanziamento come il canone RAI, che sicuramente è ingiusto, anche perché viene pagato in modo non uniforme - lo dico con il sorriso - su tutto il territorio del Paese. Il canone viene pagato da coloro che sentono come obbligo morale e di vita il pagamento delle tasse e delle imposte; ma ci sono anche i soliti furbi, che preferiscono un altro tipo di filosofia di vita e che non sentono il peso del dover corrispondere allo Stato il canone RAI. Purtroppo, come dicevo, il pagamento del canone non è omogeneo su tutto il territorio nazionale, perché ci sono delle aree dove sembra che la sua evasione sia uno sport molto praticato. Il problema del canone però non è l'unico da affrontare e discutere. Ci sono anche altre questioni, come ad esempio i canali tematici, che devono avere una loro funzionalità, un loro scopo, una loro audience. Se è vero che è importante dare un certo tipo di informazione ai cittadini prescindendo dai punti percentuali di audience, è altrettanto vero che ci sono contenuti che devono essere aggiornati e portati a tutti i cittadini con una finalità, se vogliamo, anche di crescita culturale. Basta andare in Spagna a vedere Vaughan TV per comprendere come la televisione di Stato spagnola sul digitale terrestre utilizzi questo mezzo semplice per insegnare ai bambini, e anche a coloro che bambini non sono più, l'inglese, facendo una trasmissione continua in spagnolo e in inglese per ventiquattr'ore con livelli differenziati di difficoltà, battendo continuamente il ferro su come funzioni la grammatica, la sintassi e come ci si debba esprimere nella lingua di Albione. Da questo punto di vista sono tante le cose che potrebbero essere fatte, ma che non vengono prese in considerazione perché magari si preferisce continuare a proporre canali tematici che hanno una piccola audience, ma non hanno quell'importanza culturale che potrebbe invece permettere a tutti noi di fare un salto di qualità anche nella nostra vita e nei nostri rapporti personali con soggetti che non sono cittadini di questo Paese. Se poi dobbiamo parlare della privatizzazione della RAI, allora torniamo indietro all'inizio dell'intervento; è una storia infinita, che diventa il vessillo, la bandiera di tante campagne elettorali, ma che poi, nella sostanza, non viene assolutamente compiuta e portata avanti, anche perché il carrozzone, così come è gestito, è difficilmente cedibile sul mercato. Bisognerebbe fare degli interventi drastici e questo comporterebbe anche delle reazioni, comprensibili naturalmente, in termini sindacali e di difesa dei livelli occupazionali. Il problema forse, anche in quel caso, è capire se bisogna guardare a un'azienda come la RAI per le sue finalità, intese a dare informazione e intrattenimento ai cittadini, o per finalità di occupazione, di creazione di posti di lavoro, alcuni dei quali assolutamente ingiustificati e strapagati. Questa, infatti, sarebbe un'altra delle questioni da affrontare: che vi siano conduttori o dirigenti della RAI a cui vengono elargiti stipendi e indennità monstre è una cosa di cui moralmente bisognerebbe discutere. Bisogna capire se effettivamente vi è un ritorno o se sia, invece, opportuno che quel tipo di indennità e quel tipo di importi siano elargiti dal mercato della televisione libera e non da un servizio che dovrebbe essere pubblico e quindi anche calmierato. Forse per tanti soggetti l'importanza di lavorare per la RAI, per un'azienda seria, se si dovesse addivenire ad una realtà di questo tipo, farebbe superare anche il discorso economico e l'importanza del livello della retribuzione. In quel caso sì che si diventerebbe un punto di riferimento di una Nazione per quanto riguarda l'informazione e quindi si parteciperebbe alla creazione di una credibilità istituzionale e di comunicazione, in una realtà, come quella della RAI, che può e deve riscattarsi dopo tanti anni di crisi e dopo tanti anni bui, che sono il risultato del lavoro svolto e sono da ascrivere alla responsabilità sostanzialmente di tutti. Nessuno può dire che non ha contribuito, purtroppo, alla situazione che si è venuta a creare. Ora, come dicevo, dobbiamo affrontare il problema della riforma, che è legato anche al concetto di servizio pubblico. Il servizio pubblico non è tanto da definire in base a chi lo rende, quanto piuttosto in base al contenuto dello stesso, ossia a quello che si vuole dare come informazione, come comunicazione e come intrattenimento ai cittadini, ma dipende anche dal modo in cui lo si fa: anche dalla possibilità di valorizzare, come dicevo prima, la realtà del nostro Paese, i territori, di far conoscere dei borghi sconosciuti, dalla possibilità, ad esempio, di spiegare a tutti i cittadini che non sono buoni solo i formaggi francesi. Basta andare nella valle di cui è originario il Presidente dell'Assemblea in questo momento, la Val Brembana, per sapere che esiste in Italia una realtà che ha più DOP caseari di tutta la Francia; quei prodotti magari non sono noti e non sono conosciuti, ma sono prodotti che i cittadini italiani - noi per primi che viviamo in questo Paese - dovrebbero conoscere. Eppure nessuno si cura di quello e ci vengono a proporre le esperienze sulla zona dello champagne, ci spiegano quanto è bella Reims, quanto è bella la zona in cui fanno il formaggio olandese, quanto è bella l'area del Belgio e i birrifici belgi e nessuno va a guardare le nostre eccellenze, nonostante l'Expo, nonostante abbiamo un territorio che produce tante cose buone e positive. Nessuno va a far vedere le eccellenze, anche di tipo industriale o artigianale. Ne abbiamo ancora tante, nonostante la crisi, grazie a questi imprenditori che si battono e si difendono con i denti. Andiamo però a far vedere le grandi realtà americane. È più interessante far veder la Silicon Valley o Google, Facebook, Apple che far capire che ci sono delle realtà che si affermano nel mondo, che hanno sede nel nostro Paese, spesso al Nord, e che riescono, ancora oggi, ad essere competitive. Noi non le notiamo e guardiamo solamente i giganti perché sono quelli che colpiscono di più l'immaginazione. Sono quelli che noi pensiamo essere più noti anche all'estero, ma poi se andiamo all'estero ci accorgiamo che tanti dei nostri prodotti sono conosciuti anche al di fuori dei nostri confini nazionali e che non sono così conosciuti da chi abita all'interno. Ci vuole un modo di fare formazione più ampio, a 360 gradi, che coinvolga i territori e permetta a tutte le realtà di esprimersi. Da questo punto di vista, è anche sbagliato l'accorpamento delle sedi RAI, cosa che si sta pensando di fare in queste settimane, perché vuol dire negare l'importanza dei territori stessi. Questa non è spending review, ma una scelta scellerata che porta a cancellare l'identità; è completamente sbagliato come indirizzo perché non è lì che si deve tagliare; non è lì che bisogna intervenire. Non è quel modo di fare informazione (che interessa molto ai cittadini perché a loro più vicina, soprattutto nelle realtà periferiche) che bisogna colpire. Del resto, il successo di determinate televisioni locali - parlo di quelle storiche - in alcune realtà lo testimonia: i telegiornali locali di province con un milione di abitanti riescono ad avere anche circa 250.000 spettatori ogni sera. Trasportandoli su scala nazionale si avrebbero numeri da TG1 o da TG5. Cose di questo tipo devono essere assolutamente tenute in considerazione quando si parla di riforma e quando si parla anche di nuovo board e di nuovo modo di amministrare una RAI che non vorrei possa risultare distante da queste linee di pensiero. C'è un problema fondamentale che riguarda la comunicazione. Lo dicevo prima quando facevo l'esempio della persona con cui ho parlato qualche settimana fa che mi diceva che, quando era nato, c'era solo un canale radio e non c'era la televisione e che l'unica informazione proveniva da quel canale radio. Ecco, non vorrei tornare a quell'epoca in cui, pur in presenza di più canali radio e televisivi, c'erano comunque lo stesso indirizzo comunicativo e la stessa direzione soprattutto politica di questi mezzi di informazione, con il risultato di essere asserviti esclusivamente alle volontà e alle aspettative del Governo. Questa sarebbe la scelta sbagliata e il peggiore risultato che si possa ottenere con l'approvazione di questa vostra riforma. È giusto sottolineare che è una vostra riforma perché, nonostante tutte le proposte di modifica che abbiamo formulato, non abbiamo visto nessun cenno di assenso o di condivisione e, quindi, rimane una vostra proposta, una vostra responsabilità. Rimane chiaramente una riforma di maggioranza, che, come dicevo all'inizio, non è assolutamente compiuta. È una riforma che, lasciando indietro un pezzo, costringerà nei prossimi anni il Parlamento a tornare nuovamente su questa materia e probabilmente a dire che non il sottoscritto, ma tanti altri colleghi che sono intervenuti ieri e oggi su questo tema avevano ragione nei loro interventi. Stiamo, quindi, perdendo un'occasione.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5107977986335754, 0.48920220136642456]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> PELLEGRINI Emanuele (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, ho ascoltato la relazione introduttiva e le seppur brevi dichiarazioni di voto su questo disegno di legge, che - com\\'è stato giustamente ricordato dal relatore - è di iniziativa parlamentare. La prima domanda che mi pongo è come mai si sia data priorità a un disegno di legge di iniziativa parlamentare, quando vi sono tantissime ratifiche di iniziativa governativa, anche più \"anziane\" dal punto di vista della data di sottoscrizione, che però giacciono in Commissione. Il nostro Gruppo non aderisce alla ratifica su questi emendamenti e ribadisco «su questi emendamenti», perché il Gruppo Lega è invece assolutamente d\\'accordo sullo spirito della Corte penale internazionale, ove questa vada a punire crimini di guerra particolarmente importanti. Dalla discussione che è stata svolta in Commissione e anche oggi, desumo che forse non ci stiamo rendendo conto di che cosa ci stiamo accingendo a votare. In particolare all\\'articolo 8- bis, che è uno di quelli oggetto di questi emendamenti, si introduce qualcosa di drammaticamente vicino al concetto di responsabilità oggettiva che esiste nel nostro ordinamento: quando l\\'articolo 8- bis introduce il crimine di aggressione, per cui si dice che viene perseguita la persona che ha una posizione tale da esercitare un effettivo controllo politico o militare, e questa è una limitazione vincolante per far sì che venga attuato il procedimento davanti alla Corte penale internazionale, si sta dando a questo organo un potere molto grande ed estremamente delicato. E purtroppo abbiamo visto troppo spesso come queste istituzioni a volte non siano lineari in determinate decisioni. Noi siamo assolutamente d\\'accordo sull\\'opportunità di fornire le regole particolarmente stringenti per far sì che i colpevoli vengano colpiti, ma vedo anche che l\\'Assemblea non si rende conto di quanto stiamo facendo e dell\\'importanza delle norme che ci accingiamo a votare. Queste misure, peraltro, hanno ricevuto alcune critiche non dalla parte politica cui appartengo, ma da parte di studiosi e di accademici di tutte le Nazioni, che hanno in primo luogo sminuito il fatto che l\\'applicazione concreta sarà estremamente limitata, perché queste limitazioni vincolanti renderanno praticamente impossibile l\\'applicazione di questa norma nel concreto. C\\'è poi un\\'altra norma, all\\'articolo 15- bis, che forse non è stata sottolineata abbastanza. Dovremmo sottolineare che questa norma è applicabile solo agli Stati membri che hanno materialmente ratificato gli emendamenti. Va bene, perché fino ad oggi sono una trentina quelli che le hanno ratificate, ma poi c\\'è una clausola, la cosiddetta clausola di output, in cui si dice che se uno Stato ratificante ritiene di doversi dissociare, questo non può essere fatto oggetto di un provvedimento all\\'interno della Corte penale internazionale. Ebbene, credo non dovremmo utilizzare lo strumento delle ratifiche, come purtroppo usualmente facciamo in queste Aule, votandole per così dire a scatola chiusa, senza andare nello specifico e senza capirne gli effetti anche dal punto di vista giuridico (perché qui stiamo parlando di una Corte penale) e senza capirne i veri effetti sui singoli Stati nel mondo che in futuro potrebbero essere colpiti da situazioni veramente difficili. Credo invece che potremmo dare davvero maggiore forza alle istituzioni internazionali se però anche noi oggi, nelle nostre sedi, prestassimo maggiore attenzione alle norme che andiamo ad approvare. Infatti se l\\'applicazione è corretta, portiamo avanti veramente i principi del diritto internazionale. Ribadisco che il nostro Gruppo vuole assolutamente essere protagonista e non è, come mi è stato riferito che qualcuno abbia detto, a favore dei genocidi, perché sono frasi che sono state pronunciate in queste Aule e in questi corridoi e che respingo assolutamente. Credo però che prima di ratificare a scatola chiusa degli emendamenti di questo tipo, l\\'Assemblea avrebbe dovuto fare una riflessione politica più approfondita e capire perché si è dovuti passare attraverso un\\'iniziativa parlamentare e non invece da un\\'iniziativa governativa, che avrebbe potuto prevedere la possibilità magari di andare a discutere più approfonditamente di questi emendamenti e soprattutto, andare a capire quale fosse la loro vera attuazione.

Noi siamo nell'Aula del Senato ed il confronto e il dibattito che vi si svolge dovrebbe agevolare, favorire e promuovere la migliore comprensione degli argomenti, allontanando lo spettro dei nodi ideologici che sembrano addensarsi attorno ai temi delicatissimi di cui stiamo parlando e a cui ci dobbiamo accostare privi di pregiudizi e soprattutto, se mi è permesso, documentando in modo responsabile e corretto le dichiarazioni che si fanno. Sugli inquinanti presenti nei vaccini, finanche le numerosissime analisi commissionate dai movimenti anti-vax hanno certificato che la presenza di mercurio è talmente bassa da essere quasi omeopatica e che è superiore quella presente nell'acqua, nell'aria e nei cibi che ingeriamo. Evitiamo quindi che la politica sovrasti la scienza e facciamo in modo invece che la politica sana e responsabile orienti le decisioni di quest'Assemblea secondo valutazioni scientifiche. È infatti paradossale, colleghe e colleghi, che questa legislatura sia iniziata parlando del caso Stamina e si concluda con il caso dei vaccini; due casi emblematici che formano un paradosso in cui, per un verso, abbiamo assistito alle tendopoli di chi ha sostenuto, promosso e spinto il legislatore a consentire l'accesso a metodiche terapeutiche prive di fondamento scientifico e, dall'altro, laddove il fondamento scientifico esiste (poiché è acquisito a livello internazionale che le pratiche vaccinali rappresentano la più grande conquista dopo la potabilizzazione dell'acqua) abbiamo introdotto, su basi assolutamente gravi di insinuazioni e di infondatezza scientifica clamorosa, la cultura del sospetto che induce la popolazione, non a essere contraria, ma ad essere confusa.

Signora Presidente, preannuncio il voto favorevole al provvedimento da parte del Gruppo delle <PARTY>, che al suo interno raccoglie sensibilità diverse, ma tutte convergenti nel riconoscere il dato celebrativo, etico e promozionale del provvedimento in esame. Mi preme anche richiamare l'attenzione dell'Assemblea su un aspetto che forse poco è stato messo in evidenza, ovvero l'occasione, da ritenersi straordinaria, di un richiamo ad una comune visione, fondata su radici, tradizioni, valori che la comunità nazionale potrebbe trarre da questo provvedimento per ritrovare punti di vista di natura collegiale e collettiva. Su questa opportunità è fondato il tentativo non solo di recuperare identità, ma anche di trovare punti di incontro unificanti anche negli ambienti in cui la cultura si articola. Mi riferisco chiaramente alla scuola, ai centri di progettazione e di esecuzione culturale quali le accademie, le università ed i conservatori, ai tanti centri studi, alla stessa società Dante Alighieri, agli istituti di cultura italiana all'estero, che potrebbero concorrere a creare una visione collettiva fondata su valori di concordia nazionale. Tali valori potrebbero anche fungere da modello per una società globale, che va sempre più frantumandosi ed indirizzando al particulare le proprie attenzioni, affinché si affermino i valori contenuti nella letteratura italiana (con riferimento a Dante Alighieri) o nella pittura italiana (con riferimento a Raffaello Sanzio) e nell'opera di Leonardo. Apro a tal proposito una piccola parentesi. Mi sembra che questo punto di vista sia stato colto, anche per gli aspetti identificativi dell'italianità e del genio italiano, in una delle più importanti multinazionali a base italiana quale Finmeccanica, che da qualche mese ha mutato il proprio nome ed ha acquisito quello di Leonardo proprio in omaggio al grande genio, rappresentante dell'italianità nel mondo. Queste sono le ragioni per cui riteniamo che il provvedimento abbia la dignità per essere discusso in un'Aula del Parlamento e che il Parlamento impieghi del tempo utile per poter porre i giusti accenti sulla questione. Concludo facendo un rilievo che si riferisce al famoso articolo 6 della proposta di legge, ovvero alle disposizioni in materia di dichiarazione di monumento nazionale. Sembra quasi una foglia di fico; poiché sappiamo che c'è una vexata quaestio sulle modalità e sulla precarietà delle procedure, per cui finora non si è mai compreso come si arrivi a dichiarare un monumento di valenza nazionale, si è voluto approfittare di questo provvedimento per porvi rimedio. Ritengo che ciò avrebbe potuto meritare un provvedimento autonomo e a sé stante, che funzionasse da vademecum per uno o più Comuni o per le Regioni (come si dice all'articolo 6) interessate a dichiarare monumento nazionale un bene civico, un bene storico, un bene architettonico o un bene artistico. Da questo punto di vista, si utilizza quasi come un escamotage il disegno di legge, ma ritengo che, con un provvedimento a parte, avremmo avuto l'opportunità di dare grande dignità a questa giusta esigenza da parte delle comunità locali, per veder riconosciuto un bene che appartiene alla propria storia e alla propria tradizione, elevato alla dignità di monumento nazionale.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5690903663635254, 0.430909663438797]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> ROMANO (<PARTY>).

Signora Presidente, senatrici e senatori, anticipo il voto favorevole da parte del Gruppo per le Autonomie-PSI-MAIE, che evidentemente abbisogna di un'argomentazione e di un seppur breve approfondimento che vada a sostanziare e giustificare il voto favorevole in merito alla conversione del decreto-legge n. 185 del 25 novembre 2015, recante misure urgenti per interventi nel territorio. Nel decreto-legge, evidentemente, c'è una varietà di iniziative e di prese di posizione abbastanza forti, tra le quali ne evidenzierei solamente alcune, quelle che hanno un maggior impatto sociale e, ancora di più, un maggiore impatto d'ordine etico sociale oltre che di tipo economico. Mi riferisco in particolare, agli articoli 1 e 2, all'articolo 5, che riguarda il tema dell'Expo, all'articolo 12 in materia di servizio civile e all'articolo 15, per quanto riguarda gli impianti sportivi nelle periferie urbane. Gli articoli 1 e 2, si riferiscono essenzialmente al sovvenzionamento di opere da tempo molto attese, sempre rinviate, se non dimenticate, da realizzare nell'area di Bagnoli e della terra dei fuochi in Campania. Purtroppo, la rappresentazione che nel corso degli ultimi anni ha dato una immagine estremamente negativa alla Regione Campania, non ha mai trovato risposte definitive, né soluzioni esaustive e, evidentemente, si è finito sempre con il rinviare provvedimenti che avessero una concretezza attuativa. Ebbene, l'impegno da parte del Governo - e di tutti noi nell'esprimere la nostra fiducia - sui due temi significa una definitiva presa d'atto, con concretezza di termini e di provvedimenti, per quanto riguarda la bonifica ambientale e la rigenerazione urbana, sia per il territorio di Bagnoli che per la terra dei fuochi. Le ecoballe - che sono per il vero (e non è un gioco di parole) sicuramente balle di rifiuti, industriali o urbani che siano, ma quanto siano di tipo ecologico non è dato ancora sapere - lì depositate e che dal 2000 al 2009 sono diventate milioni richiedono un intervento urgente, immediato ed estremamente controllato, così come il decreto-legge predispone. Non a caso, purtroppo, l'Italia subisce procedure d'infrazione che si sono concluse con una doppia condanna - una prima condanna risale al 4 marzo 2010 e un'altra, più recente al 16 luglio 2015 - che prevede una sanzione forfettaria pari a 20 milioni cui si aggiunge una ulteriore penalità giornaliera di 120.000 euro e credo che questo, già di per sé, sostanzi l'esigenza di intervenire in tempi rapidissimi. Si impegna, quindi (e qui il passaggio è molto importante anche per quanto riguarda la tempistica, l'urgenza e il controllo da parte del Governo), il Presidente della Regione Campania a dar luogo a un piano straordinario di interventi che contempli in maniera precisa lo smaltimento dei rifiuti, la bonifica dei siti e la riqualificazione ambientale, nonché - ove possibile - il ripristino dello stato dei luoghi e anche - ove possibile - l'eventuale restituzione delle aree detenute in locazione o in altro titolo. Potremmo dire che questo può rappresentare nient'altro che un prosieguo di un atto di volontà, di un auspicio, da parte del Governo e da parte nostra, eppure non è così e per un motivo molto semplice. Nell'ambito del decreto-legge si pongono termini estremamente puntuali e, non a caso, si applica, per quanto riguarda il piano stesso, il protocollo stipulato dall'Autorità nazionale anticorruzione, altresì definita ANAC, con la Regione Campania. Inoltre, il Presidente della Regione Campania deve predisporre ed attuare, previa approvazione della Giunta regionale, uno stralcio operativo di interventi e, qualora ciò non avvenisse, interverrà lo Stato con l'esercizio di poteri sostitutivi. Questi sono elementi di grande puntualità perché la rimozione delle ecoballe avvenga in maniera definitiva ed irreversibile. Altrimenti, sarebbe un continuo rimandare, sempre a tempi futuri o a tempi migliori. Altro tema delicato è quello trattato dall'articolo 5 e con la disposizione volta a promuovere la valorizzazione delle aree in cui si è appena conclusa l'Esposizione universale di Milano 2015. In questo ambito c'è una duplice finalità, la prima delle quali, con natura evidentemente urgente, è garantire da subito un'adeguata valorizzazione del sito. Questa finalità si arricchisce, a noi sembra, di una valenza ulteriore, poiché si dà luogo ad un intervento finanziario dello Stato volto a garantire il contributo iniziale per un progetto che qualcuno potrebbe definire ambizioso (ma se non si ambisce a qualcosa di grande non si raggiunge alcunché) e cioè alla realizzazione di un polo scientifico tecnologico, in collaborazione con l'Istituto italiano di tecnologia. Credo che questo sia un aspetto estremamente positivo e possa rappresentare anche un volano ulteriore allo sviluppo della ricerca, nell'ambito della quale diverse sono le istanze da parte non solo di tutti noi, ma anche della stessa comunità scientifica, per implementare la ricerca e anche per consentire concretamente a ricercatori ed intelligenze, che normalmente si trovano ad espatriare dopo essersi formate in Italia, di ritornare in patria o di trovare direttamente sul territorio italiano uno sviluppo ulteriore e una concretizzazione dei percorsi formativi intrapresi. Certamente qualcuno potrebbe chiedersi: perché l'Istituto italiano di tecnologia e non altri? La dialettica e la diatriba sul soggetto cui attribuire questa priorità, questo onere ed anche questo onore, avrebbero portato a trascorrere mesi, direi anni, nella scelta dell'ottimo rispetto al buono e così via, senza aver concluso alcunché. Dico questo nella consapevolezza che indicare la collaborazione dell'Istituto italiano di tecnologia non significa - voglio sottolinearlo ai colleghi senatori - l'esclusione di qualsiasi altro autorevole istituto di ricerca che già esista in Italia, e in Italia di istituti di ricerca autorevoli ed accreditati a livello mondiale ce ne sono. Pensare oggi che la ricerca possa essere ascrivibile, in senso di monopolio, ad un solo istituto o ad un solo gruppo credo sia una riflessione priva di fondamento perché la ricerca si sviluppa nell'interrelazione e nella collaborazione tra più istituti e gruppi, a livello nazionale e, ancor più, a livello internazionale. Vorrei dedicare un'ulteriore considerazione all'articolo 12 del decreto-legge, che ha una sua valenza etico-sociale; rispondendo ad esigenze diverse di presidio del territorio in un'accezione sociale più che di sicurezza. In particolare, la norma prevede misure finanziarie urgenti per interventi in materia di servizio civile nazionale, con un incremento del Fondo nazionale per il servizio civile di un importo pari a 100 milioni di euro. Credo che questa declinazione dell'articolo 12 sia, nell'accezione sociale, di grande rilievo, perché dà la possibilità al servizio civile di essere supportato e accompagnato nell'importante ruolo sociale che svolge. Signora Presidente, se mi consente, vorrei svolgere un'ultima riflessione sull'articolo 15, che parla di implementazione di impianti sportivi. Anche su questo si è molto discusso. PRESIDENTE. La invito a concludere, senatore Romano. ROMANO (<PARTY>). Concludo rapidamente, signora Presidente. L'articolo 15 richiama l'urgenza di favorire la realizzazione di impianti sportivi nelle periferie urbane. Nella contingenza storica degli ultimi mesi sappiamo come le periferie urbane abbandonate che non trovino una valorizzazione possano essere fucina e focolaio di situazioni di disagio sociale che possono sfociare anche in altre criticità. Implementare la possibilità di praticare l'attività sportiva, anche sotto il controllo del CONI, può essere di grande rilievo sociale.

Per non impegnarsi nel deferimento dei possibili illeciti all'autorità giudiziaria, si crea un apparato sanzionatorio parallelo, che passa per l'amministrazione e arriva all'ANAC, che si riterrà soddisfatto anche solo con un principio di prova, senza sollecitare l'assai più rigoroso scrutinio (indizi chiari, univoci, concordanti) che richiede, appunto, il giudizio penale. In altre parole, tutte le volte che si riterrà di non poter provare un episodio corruttivo, sarà assai più comodo attestarsi sull'ipotesi minimale della mala gestio, per punire in sede disciplinare - o, peggio ancora, extra amministrativa, grazie alle determine dell'ANAC - chi non ha modo di difendersi, rimanendo, appunto, appeso a un filo. Già, perché in una qualche fase del giudizio penale l'imputato giunge comunque a conoscere il nome di chi lo accusa, ne viene a conoscenza. Infatti, uno degli elementi fondamentali della difesa è quello di dimostrare la non credibilità dell'accusatore. Come si fa a ottenere lo stesso risultato in un giudizio amministrativo nel quale questo nome, presto o tardi, non salta fuori? L'esigenza sottesa al testo è giusta, ma andava soddisfatta diversamente, senza abbassare il livello delle garanzie. La mia proposta, in sede di esame del disegno di legge n. 19, fu anche più rigorosa. L'emendamento 5.0.302, a mia firma, intendeva punire con l'arresto fino a sei mesi «chiunque pubblica in tutto o in parte, anche per riassunto o a guisa d'informazione, l'identità del segnalante», fino a quando l'indagine preliminare fosse stata in corso. Tuttavia, mi mantenevo, non a caso, all'interno del sistema processuale penale, rispettando il punto di equilibrio - ivi previsto - tra le responsabilità di ciascuno: imputato, accusatore, giudice, tutti alla luce del pubblico dibattimento. La Presidenza preferì tuttavia dichiararlo improponibile per dare invece spazio a questo testo che deroga alle garanzie processuali più elementari. Visto che ci siamo, segnalo un'altra anomalia della gestione parlamentare di questo testo, che inizialmente era stato deferito alle Commissioni riunite giustizia e affari costituzionali. Poco dopo il suo arrivo dalla Camera dei deputati, con riferimento espresso a tale disegno di legge i deputati radicali della scorsa legislatura presentarono la petizione n. 1.538, che proponeva l'estensione della possibilità di whistleblowing anche ai dipendenti dalle Camere. Fu anch'essa deferita alle Commissioni riunite e lì è rimasta, anche dopo che, con decisione discutibile, il disegno di legge passò alla sola Commissione affari costituzionali. Quindi, oggi non possiamo parlare dell'intelligente proposta dei radicali, che anche in questo invitava a superare l'autodichia, in nome del principio di parità tra i cittadini e, quindi, tra tutti i pubblici dipendenti. Non si capisce, infatti, perché continuare a escludere, quanto meno dalla normativa Severino già esistente, una nicchia amministrativa che in passato si è segnalata per opacità. Se, ad esempio, Scarpellini ha evaso l'IVA sugli affitti della Camera del 2011 (come accertato dalla sentenza del tribunale di Roma in questa settimana), forse sono tenuti a saperlo anche coloro che gestivano il contratto dal lato dell'affittante. Se il contenuto della petizione fosse stato legge, ce ne saremmo accorti tutti prima e, forse, il discredito per le istituzioni che sopportano il peso di queste situazioni sarebbe stato minore. Ci sono però responsabilità del legislatore: leggi equivoche, contraddittorie e incerte nella loro definizione e tassatività, zone grigie volute o irresponsabilmente determinate. Sono anche alla base di uno stato generale, oltre a essere mancante qualsiasi controllo amministrativo preventivo che, appunto, non agisce in maniera precauzionale, mettendo in discussione - anzi, sanzionando - gli atti amministrativi non conformi alla legge. Ci sono responsabilità degli amministratori, sindaci e Presidenti. Nell'indagine che la Commissione antimafia ha fatto sul Comune di Roma è emersa in maniera chiara l'assenza di qualsiasi controllo interno, qualsiasi audit o ispettorato che esercitasse un controllo preventivo all'interno di un'istituzione che, con le sue partecipate, conta circa 60.000 dipendenti. Ci sono però responsabilità anche più generali del nostro Paese, cioè di noi cittadini. È un Paese povero moralmente questo, se deve premiare chi fa solo il proprio dovere. È un Paese povero questo, se deve proteggere coloro che fanno solo il proprio dovere. È un Paese povero questo, che ha bisogno, anche in tempi di pace, di eroi. Signor Presidente, io non mi rassegno. Credo in un Paese in cui ci sono ancora coloro che non si piegano all'omertà, all'arbitrio e alla convenienza personale. Ci sono cittadini e parlamentari che dicono quello che pensano e fanno quello che devono.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.553627610206604, 0.446372389793396]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> RUFA (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, la Commissione, a seguito di audizioni, documentazione e testimonianze, presenta oggi in Aula un atto di indirizzo, a riconoscimento dell'impegno notevole e difficile degli uomini e delle donne che si prestano alla risoluzione di una problematica complessa e articolata nei centri antiviolenza e nelle case rifugio. L'incolumità e la sicurezza delle donne vittime di violenza e di abusi è motivo di vita delle Forze dell'ordine tutte, dei servizi di tutela e di tutti i volontari che accolgono, aiutano, ascoltano e proteggono le vittime di violenza. A loro va il più sentito ringraziamento. Un doveroso e particolare ringraziamento lo rivolgo ai parroci che, nel silenzio, spesso sono la prima speranza di salvezza per molte donne sfortunate. La politica deve fare la propria parte; in modo particolare la Commissione d'inchiesta deve mostrare preparazione, responsabilità e libertà da preconcetti e logiche di partito. La Commissione ha redatto la risoluzione sollecitata dalle necessità e dalle richieste, più o meno celate, di oltre 350 centri antiviolenza e di oltre 250 case rifugio. Si rivendica chiarezza, già a cominciare da un numero certificato di tali strutture, e si chiede che rispettino requisiti strutturali omogenei. Non sempre, infatti, sono operative in esse figure professionali, accreditate o specializzate, come richiesto dalla Convenzione di Istanbul. La Commissione è stata informata e ha compreso che i centri misti, le cui finalità non sono solamente specifiche alla sfera della violenza sulle donne, non possono rappresentare al meglio il luogo finalizzato alla sicurezza e alla incolumità fisica e psicologica. Occorrono centri, case rifugio e strutture specializzate e preparate alla complessità del fenomeno della violenza sulle donne e di tutto il contesto che lo circonda, fino ad arrivare alle conoscenze delle diversità religiose e culturali. La risoluzione evidenzia, inoltre, la problematica della distribuzione dei fondi disponibili, non solo limitandoli attraverso la specializzazione tali centri, ma anche e soprattutto scongiurando il dubbio che alcune strutture possano diventare un vanto e una conseguenza politica, delegittimando l'intento e la natura notevole degli stessi. Per la Commissione è un dubbio inaccettabile. Allora occorrono criteri di distribuzione economica categorici e omogenei e requisiti strutturali e professionali obbligatori per i vari centri antiviolenza; il metodo non della raccomandazione per conoscenza, quanto piuttosto della meritocrazia nel finanziare progetti e strutture. Inoltre, nella Conferenza Stato-Regioni si sono deliberati 30 milioni: 10 milioni per centri antiviolenza, non solo pubblici ma anche privati, e 10 per case rifugio, non solo pubbliche ma anche private. I fondi, senza programmazione necessaria, sono del 2019 e la Commissione rivendica che le associazioni stesse chiedono velocità nella distribuzione economica. È fondamentale avere una certezza per programmare e garantire, con efficacia, la qualità del servizio di assistenza e di recupero. Il periodo di emergenza Covid-19 è stato testimonianza di ciò. Le figure professionali specializzate sono essenziali per affrontare e gestire il fenomeno della violenza fisica e morale. Ma, oltre al coraggio e al gran cuore, per i quali non c'è cifra che ne ripagherà l'impegno, esse vanno stipendiate e riconosciute per il lavoro effettuato. Premesso che l'unico percorso per chi abusa delle donne è una pena vera e duratura, in ambito normativo si è fatto tanto, anche se mai troppo. Nel 2009, l'Italia ha introdotto già il reato per atti di persecuzione; nel 2013, c'è stata la ratifica della Convenzione di Istanbul; nel 2019, la legge Codice Rosso. Le associazioni ci chiedono anche un aiuto effettivo e concreto. Il rapporto Grevio afferma che normare è più facile dell'azione programmatica di contrasto, ma questa deve iniziare già nelle famiglie e nelle scuole e passare anche per programmi mediatici, con atti di sensibilizzazione, controllo e condanna di mitomanie negative. Le regole, le richieste e le problematiche si moltiplicano quando, nelle strutture antiviolenza, oltre alle donne vittime ci sono anche i figli. Questo, insieme al vuoto assordante sulle donne e ragazze disabili vittime di violenza, dovrà essere il punto di partenza per la prossima risoluzione. Nell'ordinamento giuridico italiano, infatti, non esiste ancora una specifica normativa a loro tutela. Perciò, c'è tanto da fare. Sicuramente questa risoluzione è il continuo di una serie di battaglie di contrasto alla violenza. Al Governo si chiede oggi di implementare risorse, di specializzare e indirizzare centri e strutture antiviolenza, velocizzare e ottimizzare le erogazioni di denaro, premiare e riconoscere specifiche figure professionali, controllare i progetti ed erogazione di somme del fondo disponibile. Mi permetto, signor Ministro, visto che siamo in fase di sollecitazioni, di ricordarle che manca ancora la firma sul decreto del Presidente del Consiglio in merito all'obbligo di esposizione della cartellonistica del numero verde 1522 nei locali. Penso che si possa immediatamente porre rimedio. <p> Come Commissione di inchiesta siamo in doverosa disponibilità a partecipare fattivamente a tali impegni e chiediamo che la risoluzione venga accolta da tutti, ma a tutti chiedo di non fermarci qui. <p> Signor Presidente, mi permetta di chiudere questo intervento onorando e commemorando in quest'Aula, con immensa tristezza, Willy Monteiro Duarte, morto a ventuno anni: per la mamma, il suo piccolo gigante che voleva fare il cuoco; un ragazzo d'oro, che amava amare, fino a rischiare la vita per difendere un amico.

Ho accettato di essere relatore di questo disegno di legge perché, evidentemente, ne condividevo lo spirito e la tematica che viene affrontata e di cui si tenta una soluzione. Come relatore non sono nella posizione di dover svolgere la difesa politica del documento che spetta, evidentemente, al Governo, mentre ritengo di dover fare delle osservazioni che attengono ai profili di fondo emersi nella discussione. <p> Innanzitutto, vorrei soffermarmi sul tema qualificante del provvedimento, cioè sul tema relativo al problema dei precari della pubblica amministrazione e delle società partecipate. <p> Credo che se c\\'è approccio realistico e non pregiudiziale, se c\\'è un approccio responsabile non si può non negare che il problema dei precari... (Brusìo). Scusate, capisco che l\\'argomento possa... PRESIDENTE. Colleghi, posso capire che è l\\'avvio di seduta, dato che però ormai è avviata prego i colleghi di consentire al relatore di svolgere la replica. Prego, senatore Pagliari, continui pure. PAGLIARI, relatore. Il problema dei precari non è nato per caso, non è frutto del fato, è il frutto di scelte politiche che non possono essere negate, ma che una classe politica responsabile può solo assumere come un tema da risolvere e superare. Questo richiede un processo costituito da norme che portano ad una uscita dal problema attuale... (Brusìo). Signor Presidente, in queste condizioni rinuncio a svolgere la replica. <p> Il tema dei precari pone il problema di uscire da questa situazione tenendo conto delle aspettative che comunque la permanenza in servizio definita dalle scelte politiche ed amministrative ha determinato; peraltro, ciò richiede un processo che disciplini in modo chiaro e coerente il tema dei contratti a termine e comunque delle prestazioni temporanee e dia soluzioni chiare che possano e debbano essere seguite. <p> Credo vada affermato con chiarezza - per parte mia, come relatore, mi batterò su questo piano, con ogni strumento a disposizione e con tutta la determinazione possibile - che, se siamo un Senato responsabile, il problema non può essere risolto senza fornire una via di uscita, una risposta alle aspettative dei precari della pubblica amministrazione. <p> È evidente che ciò non avviene con le proroghe, che non hanno visto distinzione di responsabilità nei Governi che si sono succeduti, ma avviene per la prima volta con un procedimento che pone il tema del superamento del precariato in modo chiaro: si afferma che i precari possono accedere a concorsi superando i quali possono aspirare al posto, che peraltro è subordinato alle disponibilità di bilancio. In questa situazione - sia chiaro - noi non facciamo un «piacere» ai precari, ma diamo loro una possibilità di uscita, che non è la stabilizzazione. <p> Credo che su questo piano, salvo poi discutere le scelte dal punto di vista tecnico-giuridico (al riguardo vi è stata ampissima disponibilità, che peraltro permane), non possa non esservi assoluta chiarezza. Non so se c\\'è condivisione di tale scelta oppure no, ma ciascuno si deve assumere le proprie responsabilità. Lo voglio affermare con estrema chiarezza perché io che sono in quest\\'Aula da sei mesi avverto fino in fondo la sensibilità nei confronti del precario, non per retorica, ma perché in questo momento il precario è vittima della situazione e non certo il responsabile; a mio avviso, egli non può essere trasformato in alcun modo nel responsabile. <p> Questo percorso non dà garanzie, indica una strada che non dà certezze; sappiamo tutti che non dà certezze neanche per quanto riguarda il tema dell\\'acquisizione del posto. Il concorso garantisce una selezione che, se effettuata seriamente (come credo dovrà essere fatta), garantirà anche la selezione del personale. Credo che i processi alle intenzioni sulla base del fatto che «tanto si sa come va in Italia» siano una comoda via di fuga rispetto alla decisione politica da assumere. <p> Ritengo che si ponga il medesimo problema anche riguardo al tema delle società partecipate, il quale sotto tale profilo - lo voglio premettere - ha avuto in sede di lavori nella 1ᵃ Commissione permanente una ridefinizione che ne limita i tempi e ne circoscrive la portata; il tema delle società partecipate è stato immesso nel contesto di un disegno riformatore di tutto il sistema, avviando anche in questo caso una soluzione che passa attraverso il piano industriale delle società partecipate deciso dall\\'amministrazione committente e quindi dagli enti pubblici, che sul piano dei princìpi non può che essere una garanzia. <p> Non si possono equiparare le società partecipate in senso stretto alle società per azioni di vero diritto privato. Si tratta di altra cosa: lo sono dal punto di vista giuridico e lo sono state da quello politico. <p> Credo che questo sia l\\'errore di un sistema di società partecipate che, soprattutto a livello degli enti locali, si è ingigantito a dismisura. Non è stato uno strumento sinergico per le amministrazioni comunali per lo svolgimento dei loro compiti, bensì spesso uno strumento attraverso il quale le società partecipate o hanno esternalizzato decisioni che, sul piano politico, sarebbero dovute essere assunte in sede istituzionale - sono state esternalizzate per sfuggire alle responsabilità istituzionali - o hanno alimentato clientelismo e dato luogo ad assunzioni aventi spesso carattere clientelare. <p> Detto questo, la politica che vuole superare i problemi non cancella gli errori: guarda avanti e individua soluzioni che possono contemperare le esigenze di sicuro superamento dei sistemi, con la necessità di tener conto dei destini umani ai quali vanno date risposte, e non stabilizzazione ma percorsi che consentano di non trovarsi dall\\'oggi al domani in una situazione insostenibile. <p> Sappiamo tutti come il tema delle società partecipate interessi tutta l\\'Italia. Sappiamo bene tutti come esso possa incidere complessivamente sugli equilibri di tante amministrazioni comunali. Allora credo che, anche sotto questo profilo, la soluzione trovata in Commissione affari costituzionali abbia già offerto una via limitata nel tempo, corretta sul piano dell\\'investimento, definita e contenuta. Rispetto a questo, però, con tutto il rispetto nei confronti delle opinioni altrui, non credo si possa parlare di assoluto privilegio. In questa situazione stiamo ragionando nella prospettiva di una disciplina organica che superi quella attuale delle società pubbliche e ridimensioni complessivamente tutto il sistema. Siamo quindi di fronte ad una norma che tenta di \"passare la nottata\" e lasciare il sistema inveterato. È una norma che si pone in un processo di superamento che necessariamente ha due ambiti: da un lato, la riforma e, dall\\'altro, l\\'uscita dall\\'attuale sistema. Non si esce, però, dall\\'attuale sistema chiudendosi la porta alle spalle. <p> Vi è poi il tema dell\\'Agenzia della coesione territoriale. Capisco la sua delicatezza, ma credo che anche a tal riguardo dobbiamo fare un atto di onestà intellettuale: dobbiamo dirci se ci possiamo permettere di andare avanti facendo finta che, sul piano dell\\'effettiva spesa dei fondi europei, siamo all\\'altezza dell\\'Europa e siamo efficienti. Sappiamo tutti che stiamo rischiando di perdere questi fondi per una ragione molto semplice: il sistema pubblico, così come è strutturato oggi, non è in grado di decidere nei tempi necessari. <p> Allora, io credo che sotto questo profilo vada fatta una riflessione, se vogliamo anche brutale e me ne scuso, molto chiara. Lo strumento per superare questa situazione va trovato in termini di urgenza. Questo spiega perché l\\'Agenzia per la coesione territoriale è inserita in questo provvedimento. Va trovato avendo attenzione all\\'efficientamento del sistema e non avendo attenzione alle dinamiche che sempre si producono di fronte a queste situazioni per le quali chi ha la competenza e non è riuscito ad esercitarla in modo adeguato alla competenza, non vuole rinunciare e preferisce lo status quo rispetto al superamento di questa situazione. Rispetto a questo dico personalmente «no» facendo anche un altro ragionamento. Chi conosce la complessità dei temi legati all\\'organizzazione pubblica sa benissimo che l\\'organizzazione pubblica o è strutturata adeguatamente a tutti i livelli di funzione necessari perché l\\'amministrazione pubblica produca le sue decisioni o sa che l\\'amministrazione pubblica non giunge alle decisioni. Chi conosce la macchina amministrativa sa che, nel momento in cui si inceppa, bisogna individuare qual è la rotella che manca, qual è il modello che va superato, qual è la soluzione migliore. Ora, credo che l\\'Agenzia per la coesione territoriale, nel momento in cui si pone - obiettivamente, in base alla disciplina, si pone su questo piano - come agenzia che offre una competenza istruttoria, come agenzia che promuove lo svolgimento adeguato dei procedimenti per arrivare alla spesa, come organismo che si preoccupa di contribuire a che tutto il sistema pubblico che deve provvedere alla spesa dei finanziamenti pubblici arrivi a ciò, sia una scelta da compiere perché non si inserisce allo stato attuale del piano legislativo come un organismo non necessario, ma come uno necessario per superare le inefficienze. Può essere la soluzione definitiva? Io credo che tutti debbano avere la consapevolezza che le modifiche organizzative vadano tutte sperimentate, ma non credo che in questo quadro, così com\\'è delineato dalla norma del disegno di legge, l\\'Agenzia per la coesione territoriale ponga problemi quali quelli evidenziati nel dibattito e che debba essere un\\'Agenzia che deve essere soppressa anziché avviata perché possa dare il proprio contributo al processo che deve essere messo in essere. Sul piano dei finanziamenti europei, nessuno vuole limitare l\\'autonomia degli enti territoriali e regionali. La Costituzione la conosciamo tutti, ma nel momento in cui creiamo un organismo che dia quelle competenze professionali che possono non esserci e che comunque dia quello impulso agendo, in senso ampio, da responsabile del procedimento in questo ambito, credo che facciamo un\\'operazione necessaria che non preclude affinamenti lungo la strada, ma che consente oggi di partire. Per quanto riguarda il tema sollevato della qualità della legislazione, credo che da questo punto di vista ci sia una consapevolezza assoluta e la Commissione affari costituzionali ha più volte affrontato questo tema anche attraverso un pregevole contributo del senatore Palermo. Tutti sono consapevoli che c\\'è un tema che riguarda il modo di redigere le leggi, il modo di ordinare e coordinare la legislazione che non può essere assolutamente accantonato e che, se la legislatura avrà un respiro, credo possa essere affrontato perché è una delle riforme più importanti. Si tratta di una riforma che attiene alla stessa democrazia, ma attiene anche ad una legislazione che, anziché produrre delegificazione, produca davvero l\\'effettività della legge. Ora, questo è un tema generale, non è un tema che si può porre rispetto alla singola disposizione. Io sono consapevole che c\\'è un tema di qualità della legislazione, che nella XVI legislatura si è drammaticamente aggravato; sono assolutamente consapevole che va superato. Ma il problema dell\\'approccio positivo o negativo al decreto o a sue singole parti non può essere bloccato da queste situazioni. Ci sono poi altri problemi che sono emersi, in materia di insegnanti all\\'estero e su altre materie ed altri temi riguardanti la scuola. Credo che, da questo punto di vista, sia evidente la difficoltà di discutere questi temi in questa sede; questi temi, a stretto rigore, sarebbero temi da altra sede di materia e da inserire in un decreto-legge specifico sulla scuola. PRESIDENTE. Senatore Pagliari, ha ancora un minuto per concludere. PAGLIARI, relatore. Grazie, signor Presidente. Io credo che la soluzione che è stata offerta sia una soluzione logica ed immediata per quanto riguarda gli insegnanti all\\'estero. Mi rendo conto delle molte e dolorose scelte, che non soddisfano tutti i precari. Da questo punto di vista, ho la massima disponibilità a continuare il confronto. Voglio dire, tra l\\'altro, che c\\'è tutto il tema dei tirocinanti che non viene assolutamente affrontato; ma sappiamo bene quali sono i limiti di un\\'operazione come questa in queste condizioni di bilancio. Quindi mi appronto al lavoro d\\'Aula sugli emendamenti in queste condizioni e con questo spirito.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5291916131973267, 0.47080835700035095]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> ESPOSITO Stefano (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, come è noto, nella serata del 3 giugno Torino è stata colpita da un grave incidente legato alla finale di Champions League, che si svolgeva in Scozia. Le attività parlamentari erano ferme in quel momento e non c'è stata, quindi, occasione di fare una comunicazione al riguardo. È noto a tutti che purtroppo, nei giorni scorsi, è deceduta Erika, una delle ragazze ferite. Il mio intervento vuole sottolineare che, dopo quegli accadimenti, nella serata di ieri a Torino c'è stata purtroppo un'ulteriore coda legata agli avvenimenti di piazza San Carlo, seppur indirettamente. Dopo quegli avvenimenti il sindaco di Torino, in accordo con il prefetto e il questore, ha scelto di emanare una serie di direttive più rigide sulla vendita degli alcolici e sul loro consumo; norme che purtroppo sono state da subito contestate da alcuni settori noti della città, in particolare dal centro sociale Askatasuna, i cui esponenti negli ultimi dieci giorni hanno aggredito a più riprese le Forze dell'ordine. E si è arrivati a registrare ieri, in piazza Santa Giulia, a degli scontri che hanno coinvolto anche degli avventori presenti nei dehor. È evidente, signora Presidente, che si tratta di una vicenda molto grave per Torino, una città abituata da molti anni a ospitare feste di piazza, ad avere intere sue parti dedicate alla cultura, alla musica e all'incontro tra le persone. Quanto è avvenuto in piazza San Carlo è un fatto incredibile: 1.527 feriti. Non credo che, per un momento di svago, sia mai capitata una situazione di siffatto tipo. Ma qui non siamo a cercare delle responsabilità che dovranno essere accertate. Quello che è certo è che è necessaria la piena tutela delle Forze dell'ordine. Ieri dei poliziotti sono stati aggrediti e feriti da esponenti di questo centro sociale, purtroppo tristemente noto. E devo dire che sono preoccupato che ci possa essere, in qualche forza politica, l'idea che la colpa di far rispettare le norme, volute peraltro dal sindaco di Torino e che noi sosteniamo - fino a quando saranno in vigore - possa ricadere sulle Forze dell'ordine e non sul teppismo politico del centro sociale. Credo sia utile che questa comunicazione venga trasmessa anche al Ministro dell'interno e doveroso portare la solidarietà alle Forze dell'ordine.

Signor Presidente, signor Ministro, signori senatori, il Gruppo Lega apprezza la mozione presentata dai colleghi, che ha posto all'attenzione di quest'Assemblea l'importanza di Roma come capitale del Paese, con l'intento di voler diffondere e valorizzare il suo ruolo di capitale, promuovendo lo sviluppo futuro della città, tramite una serie di iniziative celebrative e commemorative, in occasione della ricorrenza del 150° anniversario della proclamazione a capitale d'Italia. Riteniamo che il ricorrere del 150° anniversario dalla proclamazione di Roma Capitale debba però rappresentare l'occasione per affrontare più compiutamente un tema di importanza strategica, non solo per la città di Roma, ma per l'intero Paese, con l'auspicio che questa discussione possa rappresentare un primo ma importante tassello nel percorso che veda il Parlamento riconoscere a Roma una maggiore autonomia nell'esercizio di poteri e di funzioni, dotando la capitale d'Italia delle necessarie risorse, utili a una migliore gestione del suo patrimonio archeologico, storico e architettonico. Proprio oggi che Roma si appresta ad affrontare il 150° anniversario dalla sua proclamazione a capitale del Paese, ritengo che non sia più rinviabile il riconoscimento di uno status che in termini di autonomia possa realmente garantire l'obiettivo di poter preservare il valore di città eterna, di città aperta, simbolo di vittoria e liberazione, che le è riconosciuto a livello internazionale. Se guardiamo Roma con uno sguardo alle altre capitali europee, come correttamente sottolineato dalla mozione che stiamo discutendo, non si può non constatare come le maggiori capitali europee e occidentali godano di finanziamenti specifici per l'espletamento delle funzioni connesse al loro ruolo in seno all'ordinamento statale, indispensabile anche per contribuire alla conservazione e alla valorizzazione di un patrimonio storico e culturale di enorme valore che raramente appartiene alle sole amministrazioni locali, che necessita dunque di interventi dei rispettivi Stati nazionali. Non possiamo parlare di Roma senza considerare che il suo territorio da solo risulta più grande di quello delle altre otto più grandi città italiane messe insieme ed è equivalente alla somma di nove tra le maggiori capitali europee: parliamo di Amsterdam, Berna, Atene, Bruxelles, Copenaghen, Dublino, Lisbona, Parigi e Vienna. Nonostante questi dati pongano in evidenza la grandezza di Roma, non si può fare a meno di evidenziare come a ciò non corrisponda un adeguato riconoscimento normativo in termini di autonomia che spetta invece alle principali capitali europee che, sia pure con specifiche diverse, godono di forme di autonomia riconosciute dai rispettivi ordinamenti. A titolo esemplificativo, in Germania e Austria, Berlino e Vienna sono Länder; in Spagna, Madrid rappresenta una comunità autonoma; in Belgio, Bruxelles è divenuta la terza regione. Guardando oltreoceano, Washington non è solo la capitale degli USA, ma è anche uno Stato. Roma è l'unica città al mondo che ospita tre circuiti di ambasciate: come capitale della Repubblica, come sede dello Stato della Città di Vaticano e come sede dell'Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite per l'alimentazione e l'agricoltura (FAO). Al contempo, però, Roma è una delle poche capitali mondiali che ancora oggi non gode di una particolare autonomia. Condividiamo la preoccupazione espressa nella mozione in esame per la drammatica emergenza economica causata per la città di Roma dall'epidemia da Covid-19, in particolare con la paralisi del settore del turismo, da sempre asse portante dell'economia cittadina, per cui si rende necessario un sostegno straordinario da parte dello Stato nei confronti della città. Riteniamo che oltre a questo sostegno straordinario, in occasione della ricorrenza dei centocinquant'anni dalla sua proclamazione a capitale, Roma meriti anche una nuova considerazione all'interno dell'ordinamento italiano. Ricordo infatti che oltre ad essere la nostra capitale, come riconosciuto dall'articolo 114 della Costituzione, Roma è stata definita dalla legge n. 42 del 2009 come ente territoriale Roma Capitale. In virtù di ciò, le sono state riconosciute specifiche funzioni amministrative sul tema dell'edilizia pubblica e privata, dello sviluppo economico, dei beni culturali e della protezione civile. Il primo vulnus normativo che riteniamo debba essere quanto prima superato sta nel fatto che le prerogative riconosciute a Roma Capitale insistono solo sul territorio comunale e non sull'area della Città metropolitana, così come istituita nella legge n. 56 del 2014. Una soluzione a questa incongruenza consisterebbe nel voler costringere l'area metropolitana con quella comunale, costituendo una Roma centrale cui la Regione Lazio dovrebbe inevitabilmente cedere alcune competenze. Attraverso un decentramento municipale, si tratterebbe di riconoscere anche ai singoli municipi, oggi nell'area metropolitana, maggiori poteri e maggiore autonomia, anche finanziaria, sui propri territori nell'interesse dei cittadini e dei servizi che ad essi vanno erogati. Solo così potremo veramente riconoscere a Roma il ruolo di capitale del Paese, valorizzando al contempo i singoli municipi che ad oggi ricadono nell'area metropolitana e che spesso faticano a godere delle risorse di cui necessiterebbero perché il più delle volte trattenuti a livello centrale. Sono questi gli obiettivi che si prefigge di poter raggiungere la nostra proposta di legge che reca disposizioni sull'ordinamento della Città metropolitana di Roma Capitale che, riconoscendo ad essa una propria autonomia, creerebbe indubbi benefici anche agli altri capoluoghi della provincia del Lazio. Parliamo di Viterbo, Rieti, Frosinone e Latina che il più delle volte vedono sottratte dai propri territori risorse regionali che con l'ordinamento attuale vengono perlopiù fagocitate da Roma, alla quale dovrebbero invece essere destinate risorse specifiche dello Stato. Per tale ragioni esprimeremo un voto favorevole alla mozione in esame con l'auspicio che essa possa rappresentare il primo tassello di un percorso legislativo che veda finalmente il Parlamento discutere di Roma e di quanto necessario affinché quella che da centocinquanta anni è la capitale del nostro Paese, sede delle principali accademie di arte e cultura, centro della cristianità del mondo e culla del diritto, possa vedere pienamente riconosciuto il suo status di capitale italiana.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5845781564712524, 0.41542184352874756]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> LANGELLA (<PARTY>). Signor Ministro, la globalizzazione dei mercati fa confrontare i nostri produttori con quelli del mondo. Resiste alla sfida globale chi propone qualcosa di estremamente innovativo o chi produce, nella manifattura tradizionale, con processi innovativi e quindi a costi concorrenziali. Ridurre i costi per unità di prodotto in Italia è una impresa difficile perché, comunque, rimane alto il costo del lavoro, perché comunque alto è il costo dell'energia (due volte rispetto a quello degli Stati Uniti, che pure è un Paese a grande innovazione). I problemi di chi produce in Italia si moltiplicano nel Mezzogiorno, a causa della cronica carenza di infrastrutture e di reti. Nel titolo del nostro question time manca una parola, a mio giudizio: «ricerca», che non può essere disgiunta da «innovazione» e dal conseguente «sviluppo». Vi sono realtà di eccellenza nel nostro Mezzogiorno che andrebbero sostenute attraverso incentivi ulteriori per chi investe in ricerca e innovazione industriale.

Signora Presidente, le parole del presidente Azzollini hanno chiarito molto bene che l'emendamento 11.35 (testo 3) è d'importanza straordinaria per dare forza a quell'opzione politica che è stata fatta con il cosiddetto decreto paga debiti, con il quale lo Stato sana i suoi debiti nei confronti delle imprese: l'abbiamo fatto con 40 miliardi di emissione di nuovi titoli del debito pubblico, stavamo nei parametri, la procedura sta funzionando, faremo le verifiche con il tempo. In questo caso si agisce sui debiti di parte corrente, quindi non di parte capitale, e non sono una parte esiziale del debito delle pubbliche amministrazioni verso le imprese. Nelle stime della Banca d'Italia sull'ammontare complessivo del debito, che al 15 settembre dovremo avere però certificato da tutte le amministrazioni territoriali e da quelle sanitarie, si parlava di 90 miliardi di euro di stock di debito accumulato nei confronti delle imprese. I 40 miliardi che abbiamo messo in campo riducono questo stato di debito. È presumibile che dei 90 miliardi di debiti della pubblica amministrazione nei confronti delle aziende - per affermazione della stessa Banca d'Italia - 25 miliardi siano debiti funzionali, cioè quelli che ci sono normalmente tra la commessa e il pagamento, e quindi hanno una loro razionalità. Esiste pertanto un differenziale di 20-25 miliardi di euro che attiene probabilmente alle partite correnti; quindi, è una parte della liquidità che manca alle imprese e che lo Stato tarda a pagare. Dal momento che non potevamo fare altre manovre analoghe a quelle del decreto paga debiti, abbiamo cercato, con il meticoloso e importante impegno della Commissione bilancio, di mettere in fila una procedura complessa (ma difficile prima, cioè nell'impostazione, non dopo), che prevede si affronti anche l'indebitamento corrente, ricorrendo ad un sistema di convenzioni garantite con soggetti finanziari vari (il sistema delle banche, cassa depositi e prestiti e così via), i quali intervengono nel momento in cui è istituito il Fondo per la copertura degli oneri, a garanzia delle amministrazioni che richiedono allo Stato il supplemento di intervento per far fronte ai debiti di parte corrente. Si tratta di un'operazione che è stata riposizionata, come ha detto il presidente Azzollini, dal Parlamento. Da parte del Governo, che quindi voglio ringraziare a nome del mio Gruppo politico, c'è stata molta disponibilità su questo emendamento, che è stato più volte riformulato con l'ausilio della Commissione bilancio e che adesso ci consente, nel momento in cui la norma in esame troverà applicazione, nei 60 giorni successivi alla conversione in legge del presente decreto, di guardare con aspettativa maggiore al risanamento del rapporto tra amministrazione e imprese, per avvicinarci a quel livello di azzeramento del debito che è auspicabile in ogni Paese civile ed avanzato. Si tratta di una delle misure più complesse e importanti dell'intero provvedimento che stiamo esaminando. Si corona così un impegno assunto dal Parlamento nel corso di questi mesi, iniziato con il decreto paga debiti e la Commissione speciale per l'esame dei decreti-legge, e che adesso trova una sua applicazione chiamando in causa altri intermediari e prevedendo un meccanismo di garanzia dello Stato nei confronti delle altre amministrazioni attraverso il Fondo per la copertura degli oneri. Mi pare un buon risultato. Concludo quindi il mio intervento fortemente a favore di questo provvedimento ringraziando il senatore Santini, presentatore dell'emendamento 11.35, per la tenacia con cui ha sostenuto l'impegno per raggiungere l'obiettivo posto con questa proposta di modifica. Aggiungo solo una nota a margine: il Parlamento dovrà impegnarsi molto sia sulle tematiche che il presidente Azzollini ci ha ricordato, sia sul controllo della procedura, per verificare che effettivamente questa produca non tutti gli effetti possibili dal punto di vista della corrispondenza burocratica, ma tutti gli effetti possibili per far arrivare effettivamente i quattrini alle imprese. Abbiamo iniziato sbloccando 40 miliardi, le risorse stanno arrivando alle amministrazioni e in parte arrivano alle imprese, ma ad un certo punto dovremo sapere - e spero che entro l'anno si possa chiudere questa storia - se abbiamo effettivamente compiuto il passo decisivo per azzerare il debito tra pubblica amministrazione e imprese. Per tali motivi, votiamo convintamente a favore di questo emendamento e auspichiamo, assieme al presidente Azzollini, il controllo stabile del Parlamento sull'intera procedura e sulle interferenze burocratiche che su di essa potranno verificarsi.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5907465815544128, 0.40925344824790955]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, oggi è un'occasione importante per presentare in quest'Aula tutto il lavoro svolto dalla Commissione di inchiesta sul fenomeno delle intimidazioni nei confronti degli amministratori locali. <p> Innanzitutto va sottolineato come la Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sul fenomeno delle intimidazioni nei confronti degli amministratori locali ha svolto un buon lavoro e, per questo, devo ringraziare in particolare la Presidente della Commissione, oltre i componenti della stessa. La costituzione di questa Commissione ah hoc risponde ad una specifica esigenza di fare chiarezza sul fenomeno intimidatorio, troppo a lungo trascurato dalle tribune politiche, ma che al tempo stesso grava profondamente sui territori. Durante le nostre riunioni sono emersi dei dati allarmanti: si parla di migliaia di atti intimidatori nei confronti degli amministratori locali. Oltre 130 omicidi si registrano negli ultimi quarant'anni, per non parlare poi di tutti i casi in cui gli amministratori locali rassegnano le dimissione dal loro ruolo, senza però esporre alcuna denuncia. Si parla infatti di una cifra oscura, non quantificabile: si ipotizza una cifra molto superiore rispetto ai settanta casi finora attestati di dimissioni da parte di amministratori locali. Ciò che la relazione finale mette in evidenza è che occorre sicuramente predisporre delle misure di intervento per contrastare o quantomeno ridurre il fenomeno attraverso la condivisione e il raccordo tra le varie istituzioni locali. Occorre un dialogo costante tra le forze di polizia e gli attori istituzionali, al fine di rendere la vigilanza e la sicurezza molto più efficaci. A questo proposito, tra le misure proposte vi è quella di creare una banca dati multi-utente, a cui attingere e attraverso cui condividere informazioni sui soggetti sospetti. Ci si è resi conto, dall'analisi dei dati, che il problema è molto più presente in alcune Regioni del Sud Italia, ma anche nel Nord Italia, e al tempo stesso che i motivi che stanno dietro le intimidazioni non sono esclusivamente riconducibili al fenomeno della criminalità organizzata, tant'è che l'attività di inchiesta ci ha permesso di individuare numerose altre cause. Tra le più importanti, abbiamo rilevato che il fenomeno delle intimidazioni è riconducibile all'abusivismo edilizio, al settore delle cave, al trattamento sanitario obbligatorio, alle politiche del welfare e alle prestazioni assistenziali. Per cui, considerati tutti questi profili critici, ben si comprende come il fenomeno non è per nulla omogeneo, ma è multidimensionale. Questa precipua caratteristica è la base per ogni tipo di strategia e di politica di contrasto che si intenda sviluppare. Il nostro auspicio è che quest'indagine, contenuta nella relazione finale, sia un buon punto di partenza per predisporre misure efficaci e idonee a debellare il fenomeno delle intimidazioni e si possa creare un assetto normativo che, anzitutto, garantisca all'amministratore locale la sicurezza, che salvaguardi la sua incolumità e lo metta nelle condizioni di esercitare appieno le sue funzioni. La politica è la massima espressione della attività umana. Tanti sono coloro che si cimentano quotidianamente e con passione in attività politiche, a partire dalle attività amministrative a livello locale. Desidero inoltre ricordare, in modo particolare, la parte della relazione della Commissione riguardante l'amministrazione locale e la crisi del rapporto tra cittadini ed istituzioni. Mi hanno molto colpito, nelle audizioni svolte a livello territoriale, le affermazioni di amministratori locali, sia del Nord, del Sud che del Centro Italia, che hanno dichiarato, in modo abbastanza evidente, che in questi ultimi anni si è avuta una diminuzione del rapporto fiduciario tra i cittadini e i loro amministratori. Credo che questa sia la parte politicamente più interessante dei lavori della Commissione d'inchiesta, perché denota che il rapporto tra istituzioni e cittadini sta venendo meno. E ciò è dovuto anche al fatto che, tra il 2011 e il 2012, gli amministratori locali hanno avuto una riduzione delle spese in conto capitale del 18 per cento, delle spese per il settore sociale pari al 4,5 per cento e che più della metà dei bilanci viene utilizzata per spese di amministrazione e di gestione del territorio. Molti in quest'Aula hanno fatto il sindaco e sanno che questa figura diventa il primo anello di congiunzione tra il cittadino e le istituzioni. Tuttavia, negli ultimi anni, i sindaci, con l'aumento delle loro competenze, accompagnato però da una drastica riduzione delle loro risorse, si sono ripetutamente trovati nella condizione di non rispondere più come avrebbero voluto alle richieste dei cittadini. A questo proposito mi ha colpito l'affermazione di un sindaco della provincia di Verona il quale, parlando della diminuzione del rapporto fiduciario tra amministratore e cittadino, ha detto che vede ogni giorno, nella sua vita quotidiana, i cattivi rapporti che si registrano, specificando come segue: «Me ne accorgo quotidianamente quando ricevo il pubblico. Che sia una questione legata a una siepe o a una lampadina, tutto è occasione per litigare». Credo che questo sia uno dei motivi. Rivolgo, quindi, un appello anche alle forze politiche che in alcuni casi, spesso e volentieri, utilizzano le notizie di sprechi di risorse e di scandali (sicuramente deprecabili) per realizzare una forma di delegittimazione degli amministratori locali, e questo deve essere assolutamente evitato. Come capita per altre attività professionali, fanno molto notizia gli scandali che riguardano solo l'uno o il due per cento, e invece non viene mai data notizia - e soprattutto non si hanno mai atteggiamenti positivi, e questa dovrebbe essere prerogativa della politica - delle migliaia di amministratori che, al contrario, svolgono regolarmente, e con grandi sacrifici, il loro compito. Rivolgo allora un appello ai colleghi senatori. Continuiamo a dire che la politica è la nostra massima espressione, ma dobbiamo anche difenderla quando si fanno attacchi pretestuosi nei suoi confronti e nei confronti degli amministratori locali\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5297976136207581, 0.47020232677459717]}, {'sequence': 'Signor Presidente, una legge elettorale deve garantire - lo sappiamo - rappresentanza e governabilità e quindi trovo naturale che dopo il 18 aprile del 1948, l\\'adesione dell\\'Italia alla NATO, la ricostituzione del potere dei monopoli, l\\'accento sia caduto per molto tempo sulla rappresentanza, sulla necessità di non lasciare nessuna idea fuori dal Parlamento, tanto da indurre una parte politica a definire \"legge truffa\" un provvedimento che attribuiva un premio di governabilità all\\'insieme delle forze che avesse ottenuto il 50 per cento più uno dei voti popolari (mentre ora si parla di premi al raggiungimento del 40 per cento e si è parlato addirittura del 37 per cento). Allo stesso modo si capisce bene come, dopo la caduta del muro di Berlino e con il crollo della Unione Sovietica, si sia pensato ad una legge maggioritaria, che - come si diceva - favorisse l\\'alternanza al Governo di una destra e di una sinistra democratiche, così come nel periodo d\\'oro del decentramento dei poteri statali si pensò - ed era legittimo farlo - che la personalizzazione della figura del sindaco e poi del governatore regionale potesse avvicinare i cittadini alla politica di prossimità. <p> Meno limpido è il processo che ha portato alla legge Calderoli, recentemente cassata dalla Consulta. Là si volle in realtà consentire a un leader, il cui genio fosse capace - e lo era - di coalizzare forze diverse, non solo di disporre di un\\'ampia maggioranza parlamentare, ma anche di poter contare su una squadra che dipendesse in tutto da lui: insomma una maggioranza di nominati. È stata una scelta rovinosa, che ha delegittimato Parlamento e parlamentari, i quali, da difensori di istanze, idee e richieste popolari, sono diventati, nell\\'immaginario di molti cittadini italiani, consumatori di denaro pubblico e usurpatori del ruolo di rappresentante del popolo. Quando condanniamo l\\'antipolitica - e lo facciamo spesso, a partire dal Presidente della Repubblica - dovremmo ricordare che abbiamo votato con il Porcellum nel 2006, nel 2008 e nel 2013: errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum. E ora? Ora anche per merito di un Premier giovane e vigoroso, ma non solo, perché lo stesso percorso si coglie in altri Paesi, dalla Spagna, alla Francia, alla Grecia, il bipolarismo muscolare del ventennio trascorso non è più un pericolo nel nostro Paese. Oggi un partito politico farebbe da pivot, al centro del campo della politica e altre forze, tutte minori, gli ruoterebbero probabilmente intorno. Inoltre è stata approvata in prima lettura una legge di revisione costituzionale, che intende superare il bicameralismo e ciò facendo rafforza obbiettivamente il Governo e accorcia obbiettivamente l\\' iter di approvazione delle leggi. Allo stesso tempo - lo sappiamo - la prassi costituzionale è caratterizzata da un ricorso sempre più frequente ai decreti-legge, alle leggi delega, ai voti di fiducia: non si vede davvero perché rafforzare ancora i poteri del Premier. D\\'altra parte, Angela Merkel è il cancelliere che governa con polso fermo la Germania, anche se - come sapete - il Bundestag è eletto con legge proporzionale. Certo si può obiettare, come faceva il senatore Cociancich poco fa, che il sistema italiano somiglia a un premierato di fatto e non di diritto: non abbiamo introdotto sistemi come la sfiducia costruttiva - questo lo dico io - né il marchingegno francese che consente al Governo di dare per approvate le legge sensibili, a meno che l\\'opposizione non chieda e ottenga di sfiduciare il Governo. Bene, sia concesso: nonostante la fine del bipolarismo e la nascita - come dice Matteo Renzi - di un partito della Nazione, tanto forte è stato il trauma dei Governi deboli della lontana prima Repubblica che vogliamo comunque una legge maggioritaria. Ma allora vi chiedo, onorevoli senatori, che sia una vera legge maggioritaria, come quella inglese, in cui uno solo è l\\'eletto del collegio e gli sconfitti (anche quando i loro voti sommati insieme fossero maggioranza tra quelli validi) non contano nulla e non hanno diritto a nulla (per questa via il partito più forte ottiene in genere un\\'ampia maggioranza in Parlamento e il suo Premier diventa il dominus di Downing Street), oppure una legge maggioritaria nella versione francese che prevede il ballottaggio se nessun candidato abbia ottenuto più della metà dei voti nel collegio: è un maggioritario meno severo che tende a proteggere la seconda e talvolta la terza forza politica di Francia, e permette alleanze e desistenze tra primo e secondo turno. Ma quello che ora ci viene proposto, onorevoli senatori, questo Italicum 2.0, non sta, secondo me - scusate se lo dico così - né in cielo né in terra: è una legge che consente al candidato Premier votato dal 40 per cento di chi va alle urne di contare su una larga maggioranza in Parlamento, e se non superasse quella quota gli consegnerebbe comunque quell\\'ampia maggioranza dopo un ballottaggio, cioè dopo avere prevalso su uno sfidante, così dando all\\'investitura una forza pari a quella del suffragio universale diretto. Un Premier fortissimo, dunque, ma un Parlamento debolissimo. I deputati, infatti, verrebbero eletti in regime proporzionale, con i resti redistribuiti nel collegio unico nazionale, con la possibilità di candidature plurime, i capilista scelti direttamente dal Premier (o da meccanismi, le primarie, affidati alla buona volontà del partito di appartenenza), e un centinaio di deputati, per di più, che approdano alla Camera solo in forza del premio strappato dal Premier. Questa non è una legge maggioritaria. Il combinato disposto prevede l\\'elezione plebiscitaria di un Premier e la subordinazione duratura e istituzionalizzata dei parlamentari ai voleri del vincitore o per quota parte dei candidati Premier perdenti. Inoltre, non sono previste soglie di sbarramento (sono molto basse), e questo se ha il senso di garantire un diritto di tribuna alle forze minori obiettivamente favorisce anche la frammentazione. È questo che si vuole? Si vuole un regime che ruota intorno ad una sola forza politica e ad un solo uomo, con opposizioni frammentate e sottorappresentate? Vi ricordate, onorevoli senatori, che avete approvato la riduzione a 100 dei componenti del Senato (eletti peraltro con un voto di secondo grado) e che di conseguenza chi vincesse le elezioni con l\\'Italicum alla Camera, in forza del premio di maggioranza, potrebbe nominarsi un suo Presidente della Repubblica e determinare la maggioranza stessa della Corte costituzionale? I poteri del Governo e quelli di garanzia a un solo leader, per quanto giovane, spregiudicato e illuminato; un Parlamento invece delegittimato o, nella migliore delle ipotesi, che brilla solo di luce riflessa. Ma quale democrazia occidentale - vi chiedo - ha mai adottato una legge del genere? Se avete un esempio fatemelo sapere. Io non ne ho trovati. Oppure vogliamo imitare Russia e Turchia? Non lo fate, onorevoli senatori. Se la fretta è ormai diventata la regina dell\\'olimpo politico italiano, se si vuole da questo Senato un ulteriore atto di obbedienza che sia prodromico all\\'elezione di un Presidente della Repubblica scelto in un accorto al vertice o oggetto di una trattativa di potere provate almeno ad emendare l\\'Italicum; togliete di mezzo le candidature plurime e i capilista bloccati. Provate a reintrodurre il collegio, che è cosa diversissima da una circoscrizione pure piccola, essendo la ratio del collegio quella di investire un rappresentante del popolo, e cioè una donna o un uomo che risponda direttamente ai suoi elettori, anche a chi non lo ha votato ma lo conosce bene: lo insegue, gli parla, lo contesta, se è il caso, nel collegio. Provate a cambiare l\\'Italicum e, per favore, non parlate più di clausola di salvaguardia. Evitate almeno che si dia l\\'impressione che l\\'unica cosa che interessa a questo Senato è la diaria, con una specie di allungamento del periodo in cui ci è dato il privilegio di calcare questi luoghi.

Da qui viene la nostra dichiarazione di voto favorevole alla proposta della senatrice De Petris, che promana dalla delicatezza del tema. Sono tutti importanti i temi di questa riforma della pubblica amministrazione: non c'è alcun dubbio. Qui c'è, però, dal nostro punto di vista, la storia di una evoluzione della nostra burocrazia comunale e sui territori, che in questi anni è stata attraversata da profonde riforme, da grandi cambiamenti e da modifiche che, all'interno di un contesto così complesso, vedono la figura del segretario comunale come quella di una struttura che, dal nostro punto di vista, svolgendo quella funzione, ha avuto una grande importanza e ha saputo dare garanzie importanti alle nostre amministrazioni locali. Oggi, pur andando verso una revisione della funzione e, quindi, dell'importante ruolo da loro svolto, noi crediamo che, non in questo contesto, ma in un contesto a parte a loro dedicato, tale revisione possa svilupparsi meglio.

Giocate tra di voi, ritenendo che l'eliminazione di una tassa, assunta a merito politico di una componente del Governo, vi assolva dalla irresponsabilità complessiva. Dite che avete sterilizzato l'IVA, ma con il vostro atteggiamento state sterilizzando il Parlamento e, soprattutto, l'Italia intera. <p> Quanto al merito, voglio ricordarvi alcune questioni. Ritenete che con pochi spiccioli possa essere risolto il problema del dramma degli edifici scolastici che nel 70 per cento dei casi - ripeto, il 70 per cento dei casi - come ha rilevato di recente uno studio della Fondazione Agnelli, versa in condizioni di pericolo? Pensiamo tutti a quello che sta avvenendo in questi giorni: alle zone terremotate, agli sciami sismici presenti anche nella mia terra e ovunque in Italia. Uno scienziato ha da poco pubblicato uno studio che mette in guardia l'Italia intera perché ci potrebbe essere The Big One, e cioè un grande terremoto potrebbe colpire l'intero Paese. Pensiamo anche ai nostri figli e nipoti che stanno in scuole non sicure. Questi sono i temi fondamentali, e non quei pochi spiccioli che avete dato qua e là. <p> E che dire del Mezzogiorno, finito nel cono d'ombra anche di questa manovra finanziaria? Ormai il Sud non rientra più tra i temi prioritari. Eppure, ritenete che sia importante, perché ogni tanto anche il presidente Conte dice che parlerà del Sud e farà cose a suo favore. Intanto, però, le parole restano soltanto delle intenzioni. <p> Il Sud non rientra tra le vostre priorità. Eppure, stante la diminuzione della popolazione e un instabile equilibrio di decrescita, questa manovra di bilancio avrebbe già dovuto contenere gli ingredienti per un rilancio del Mezzogiorno. Dal 2015 al 2019 abbiamo già perso 310.000 persone, molte delle quali giovani. Tutti hanno richiamato i giovani, ma pensiamo anche ai cinquantenni e ai cinquantacinquenni che perdono il lavoro, di cui non parla mai nessuno e che sono ancora più a rischio degli altri. Mi auguro, quindi, che darete loro attenzione. <p> Guardate - mi rivolgo a qualche collega che si sta un attimo ribellando -, io non sono nella maggioranza, ma all'opposizione, e sono tantissimi gli emendamenti che ho presentato e che riguardano svariati campi, ma non ne è stato accolto neanche uno. L'aspetto più grave è che non arrivano neanche in Aula, per poter informare all'esterno le persone alle quali noi ci interessiamo: questa è la cosa grave. <p> Detto questo, io credo che con l'impoverimento del capitale umano le opportunità di crescita nel Sud siano pari a zero. Occorrono da subito politiche immediate che il Governo non propone. La mancanza di lavoro nel Sud nasce principalmente da un problema di produzione industriale, cioè dalla mancanza di una produzione di beni e servizi capaci di superare i vincoli dei mercati locali e competere a livello mondiale. <p> Occorrerebbe quindi un'attenzione particolare per evitare lo spopolamento. A questo proposito, ho presentato un disegno di legge che va proprio ad incentivare le zone interne per evitare lo spopolamento. Mi auguro che questa maggioranza ne voglia tener conto e magari - perché no - discuterlo. È questo che manca nella vostra strategia: una politica di sviluppo per il Sud che sarebbe utile all'intero Paese. <p> Oggi il Nord non è più la locomotiva e la sua crescita non traina più il resto del Paese. <p> Io ascolto sempre tutti con educazione e mi auguro che facciate anche voi lo stesso. Sono sempre stata seduta qui ad ascoltare tutti, perché credo che l'ascolto sia fondamentale quindi non disturbate quando si parla. Signor Presidente, le chiedo scusa, avrei dovuto chiedere a lei di far zittire qualche voce che sta disturbando. <p> Il Nord non attiva più quindi lo sviluppo nelle altre zone interne. Al contrario, lo sviluppo del Sud, se il Governo desse un segno di attenzione vera, si diffonderebbe in tutti i territori del Paese. Si tratterebbe di una politica necessaria sotto i profili sia dell'efficienza che dell'equità. <p> E che dire della vostra oziosa disputa circa la messa in disparte degli attuali concessionari della rete autostradale? Mentre voi discutete, i ponti cadono, la gente è impaurita, e questo, come in Liguria, deprime l'economia. E quanto la deprime, quell'economia! La costa ligure, presa d'assalto da lombardi e piemontesi, resta in queste ore deserta, perché la gente ha paura. Quella terra dilaniata necessiterebbe di incentivi prima che decine e decine di attività chiudano i battenti. La gente non arriverà neanche per queste feste, perché sono caduti ponti e perché dall'altra parte, sulle strade provinciali... <p> Il rappresentante del Governo, invece di parlare e stare lì distrattamente, magari potrebbe darmi un po' di attenzione e prendere qualche appunto. Invece vedo che continua a parlare. Poi quando avete finito... <p> Dicevo che la Liguria, alla stessa stregua delle altre parti d'Italia (a cui però è stata data attenzione), necessita di incentivi, perché in questo momento quella terra è isolata, non ha ponti e le strade provinciali sono disagiate, come già ricordato in quest'Aula, le Province hanno sì le deleghe, ma non i fondi per intervenire. Quella terra sta davvero vivendo momenti drammatici. <p> Ormai, per le grandi questioni, dall'Ilva alle autostrade, non sapendo cosa fare, vi affidate alle decisioni della magistratura - udite, udite - il cui compito istituzionale è tutt'altro; anche se affidarsi ad essa, come dimostra la sentenza sull'altoforno chiuso a Taranto, può determinare problemi drammatici per i lavoratori tarantini, come infatti sta avvenendo. <p> Parliamo poi dell'eliminazione della prescrizione. Senza la durata ragionevole del processo, sarà l'ergastolo a vita per gli innocenti. Ripeto, ergastolo a vita per gli innocenti. <p> Cosa ne è delle 160 vertenze aperte al MISE che dimostrano l'inadeguatezza del giovane ormai ex leader dei 5 Stelle, forse anche per questo riparato al Ministero degli affari esteri? E che dire delle obiezioni che la Commissione europea vi ha manifestato mettendo in evidenza l'inadeguatezza della manovra rispetto ai parametri di riduzione del debito? Troppe tasse, poi, e con scelte demagogiche sull'evasione fiscale, che lasciano il tempo che trovano. In sostanza, una somma di ingredienti messi a caso senza un filo conduttore. Questo per la logica dei cavalli alati di Platone, cui somiglia questa coalizione: ognuno guarda se stesso e nessuna auriga è in grado di sterzarli indicandogli la strada giusta. I cavalli di questo Governo, anzi i ronzini, sono ormai fuori controllo. È difficile, anzi è impossibile governare così. Anche i più avveduti di voi se ne stanno rendendo conto.

Ci avete portato a una tassazione reale del 63,8 per cento, un record mondiale. <p> Per continuare con i vostri record, che definirei assoluti: record di disoccupazione al 12,5 per cento (sono sei milioni, tra disoccupati e inoccupati); record esodati (sono 300.000, grazie alla legge Fornero che non siete stati capaci di cancellare); record disoccupazione giovanile (al 42 per cento); record dei giovani italiani emigrati all'estero (nel 2012 sono stati 68.000); record negli acconti di imposta (che superano il 100 per cento: è una contraddizione in termini, signor Presidente; dovevate chiamarli non acconti di imposta, ma furti di imposta) <p> ; record nel costo della burocrazia (61 miliardi all'anno, e non lo diciamo noi della Lega, ma il vostro Vice Ministro); record dei fallimenti (9.900 imprese fallite quest'anno, il 12 per cento in più del 2012); record nella contrazione dei consumi; record nella diminuzione delle entrate dell'IVA (con una diminuzione pari 3,5 miliardi); r ecord nel debito pubblico (134 per cento sul <PARTY>L, pari a 2.080 miliardi, secondo in Europa dopo la Grecia). Per fortuna che lei, presidente Letta, parla di contenimento della spesa pubblica, con ben 800 miliardi di spending review, di vendite, anzi di svendita di patrimonio pubblico. Dopotutto presidente Letta, lei ha un buon maestro nel presidente Prodi, che con i regali ai privati ha svenduto anche l'IRI. <p> Presidente, abbia il coraggio di tagliare le pensioni d'oro, di tagliare del tutto il finanziamento pubblico, abbia il coraggio di applicare i costi standard che hanno sostenuto i nostri governatori di Veneto, Lombardia e Piemonte; e non solo in sanità, ma lo faccia su tutta la pubblica amministrazione, compresi i Ministeri, dove non applicate nemmeno il Patto di stabilità. Vedrà che non serve né Cottarelli, né spending review, ne taglio delle Province. <p> Segua la nostra proposta di riforma costituzionale approvata nel 2005, che avete fatto bocciare con il referendum del 2006. Ricordatevi, perché su questo avete la memoria corta, che in quella riforma c'era già il taglio dei parlamentari e il Senato federale delle Regioni. Ci ha molto deluso oggi, quando ha dichiarato la morte della Bicamerale per le riforme: quella poteva essere l'unica strada per farle. Fate delle proposte serie sul mercato del lavoro, cancellate la legge Fornero e aprite alla flessibilità. Il problema non è il contratto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato (grazie a voi in Italia solo il 17 per cento dei contratti lo sono), ma dovete incentivare l'alternanza lavoro/scuola che ha dato ottimi risultati in Germania. E poi basta, basta con i contributi a Roma Capitale: altri 200 milioni per ripianare i debiti, alla faccia dei Comuni virtuosi del Nord! Basta rifinanziare i lavoratori socialmente utili di Palermo, Napoli e della Calabria. <p> E basta con gli annunci dannosi: nel 2013, fino ad oggi, sono 42.000 gli sbarchi; tutto questo grazie agli annunci buonisti e dannosi sulla cancellazione del reato di immigrazione clandestina e sullo ius soli. Basta con le amnistie, gli indulti e gli svuota carceri! Ministro Cancellieri: i carcerati non hanno bisogno di imparare a tirare a segno o a dare di boxe; lo sanno già fare meglio di tutti noi. <p> C'è bisogno di regole certe, di pene certe, di nuove carceri e maggior sicurezza per i cittadini. Su questi temi faremo ogni tipo di battaglia, dentro e fuori il Parlamento. <p> Sul versante estero, un altro disastro completo: avete chinato la testa al fiscal compact e ai vincoli europei. Avete permesso al commissario europeo Olli Rehn di entrare nel merito degli emendamenti della legge di stabilità. Inoltre, mentre la Germania raggiungeva il record degli investimenti in ricerca e sviluppo, per un importo pari al 3 per cento del <PARTY>L, lei, Presidente, si vanta di non avere superato il 3 per cento del deficit ! Questa è la realtà: loro comandano e noi ubbidiamo e basta! Presidente Letta, la gente non vuole l'euro, non vuole questo euro, che ci è stato imposto ed è stato un fallimento. La gente vuole l'Europa dei popoli, non delle Nazioni, un'Europa alle autonomie, un'Europa che difende i nostri prodotti e che non accetta la concorrenza sleale di prodotti come la «Mozzabella», il «Prosekko» e il vino solubile norvegese liofilizzato. <p> La cosa peggiore è che vi siete dimenticati non solo i poveri, non solo le imprese e tutti gli italiani in Patria, ma anche i nostri soldati, i nostri marò, abbandonati in India al loro destino. È inutile che se la prenda con la Lega: non c'è nessuna ironia, anzi: abbiamo oggi appoggiato sui nostri banchi il simbolo di chi si sta sacrificando - il basco dei nostri marò - e voteremo con convinzione la sfiducia al vostro Governo: un Governo che ha portato l'Italia nel baratro.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.568320095539093, 0.4316798448562622]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare sull'ordine dei lavori. <p> MATTESINI (<PARTY>).

Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signori rappresentanti del Governo, siamo alla conversione dell'ennesimo decreto ILVA, il decimo, e ancora una volta con una richiesta di fiducia. Quest'annosa vicenda riguarda un complesso aziendale che, per le sue dimensioni e per l'alto numero di dipendenti, è il più grande del nostro Paese ed è sicuramente quello che presenta un impatto ambientale tra i più significativi. Questo nuovo decreto riguarda il perfezionamento del precedente e mira alla soluzione di questioni relative alla cessione dei complessi aziendali, come disposto nel febbraio scorso. In altri termini, è utile - e non solo secondo me - a rendere più allettante la sua acquisizione da parte di una delle due cordate che sono in campo. Circa l'acquisto e la cessione dei complessi aziendali, voglio ricordare come fu gestita la prima cessione ai privati, quella del 1995, quando il dottor Emilio Riva poté subentrare in questa proprietà avendo a disposizione prepensionamenti di lavoratori anziani, da un lato, e contratti di formazione lavoro per l'assunzione di giovani operai, dall'altro. Si trattò di un'operazione praticamente a costo zero, anche per gli incentivi messi a disposizione. Non mi risulta che gli vennero chiesti, in quella occasione, impegni o investimenti per la sicurezza degli impianti, per il ciclo produttivo e sulle nuove tecnologie, né tantomeno per l'inquinamento. Con quella scelta gli fu offerta la licenza per inquinare e avvelenare un territorio, con il rischio che le persone si ammalassero e, molto spesso, morissero. Qualcuno parlò di una drammatica, tragica, regalia. Dopo l'epoca di Riva e il commissariamento sono state tantissime le promesse e gli impegni non mantenuti per affrontare e cercare di risolvere una situazione che si è fatta via via sempre più tragica, per la fabbrica, ma soprattutto per la città di Taranto e per il territorio circostante. Per ogni decreto d'urgenza approvato sull'ILVA ci è stato spiegato che si trattava di provvedimenti straordinari, in grado di arrivare all'esito di rendere esigibili i diritti costituzionali alla salute e al lavoro anche da parte dei cittadini di Taranto e dei dipendenti della fabbrica. Lo abbiamo fatto dieci volte in quattro anni (anzi undici, perché uno non era un decreto) fino ad approdare a quest'ultimo, che favorisce solamente la cessione ai privati. Il punto è che nulla cambierà con l'approvazione di questo decreto-legge al nostro esame ma, anzi, le misure che contiene peggioreranno la situazione attuale, dei cittadini e dei lavoratori. La fabbrica ha continuato a produrre gravi danni sulla popolazione e sull'ambiente. Con lo slittamento di diciotto mesi del termine di attuazione del piano di tutela ambientale e della salute approvato dal Consiglio dei ministri nel marzo 2014, prevediamo un ulteriore allungamento di tempi per un piano che era già stato licenziato in ritardo ed era già intervenuto spostando in avanti l'applicazione delle prescrizioni dell'autorizzazione integrata ambientale (AIA) del 2012 fino all'agosto 2016. Ricordiamo quando il Ministro dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare dichiarò che questo sarebbe stato lo strumento per risolvere i drammi di Taranto e che, subito dopo, il commissario straordinario avrebbe predisposto il piano industriale. Ma quale piano industriale! Il commissario aveva questo compito, ma non è riuscito a svolgerlo (non si trattava neppure di un compito che gli era proprio, in quanto demandato dal Governo). Nessun risanamento è stato fatto - zero - e si sono solo ulteriormente allungati i tempi e le prescrizioni dell'AIA. Come se tutto questo non fosse abbastanza, nel precedente decreto-legge del febbraio scorso i termini sono stati spostati ulteriormente in avanti (fino al giugno 2017) per arrivare, ad oggi, a una norma che consente a chi presenterà un'offerta vincolante di richiedere modifiche al piano ambientale e un differimento fino a diciotto mesi del suo termine ultimo. Questo appare come un bonus - un ulteriore, tragico bonus - a favore di chi si appresta ad acquistare e un ennesimo schiaffo sul viso a chi - soprattutto, i cittadini - continua a subire le conseguenze dell'emergenza sanitaria. Ma c'è di più. Parliamo infatti dell'estensione dello scudo giudiziario già previsto per i commissari anche ai futuri acquirenti e affittuari e ai loro delegati. Questa norma consentirà loro di non rispondere penalmente, civilmente e dal punto di vista amministrativo delle condotte che porranno in essere. Oltre a tutto quello che ho già sottolineato, c'è anche la mancata garanzia per la tenuta dei livelli occupazionali. Infatti, non si è ritenuto di dover vincolare i futuri acquirenti, inserendo la tutela dei livelli occupazionali all'interno di una specifica norma del decreto-legge. Solo in questo modo ci sarebbe stata una certezza per i lavoratori. Si profilano giornate dure per tutti gli operai, che sono circa 12.000. In ultimo, ma non per importanza, ricordo la previsione contenuta all'articolo 1 del provvedimento, volta a porre l'onere del rimborso dei 400 milioni di euro stanziati dal precedente decreto-legge a carico della struttura commissariale. Si tratta, quindi, di quattrini che saranno rimborsati dalla struttura commissariale e, cioè, posti a carico del bilancio dello Stato. Non assomiglia anche questa a una concessione troppo sbilanciata a favore dei futuri acquirenti? Non siamo in grado, come Stato, di porre vincoli cogenti ai privati acquirenti? Il decreto-legge in esame non ha nulla di urgente e l'ennesima fiducia consolida una strategia, ormai incondivisibile, che tende a non creare discontinuità con un passato insostenibile dal punto di vista ambientale ed economico. Si abbia il coraggio di dire che l'industrializzazione inquinante in territori come Taranto (ma potrei citare altri poli industriali come Ravenna, Gela o Augusta) ha fatto il suo tempo e che ora è necessario puntare alla riconversione delle aziende che, come priorità assoluta, devono perseguire la compatibilità totale con l'ambiente. Altro che slittamento dei piani ambientali! In un Paese serio ciò dovrebbe costituire la priorità delle priorità. A seguire, occorre agire nell'ottica del risanamento, delle bonifiche e dello stoppare - o almeno ridurre - l' escalation delle patologie tumorali che caratterizzano quei territori. È inutile agitare lo spauracchio della perdita dei posti di lavoro o del detrimento per l'economia nazionale, se questo è il prezzo da pagare. Ci sono valori e beni non negoziabili e la salute dell'uomo e dell'ambiente è tra questi. È passato tanto tempo, fin troppo, e non ci sentiamo di condividere ulteriori strategie del ritardo, tantomeno se condotte sotto la mannaia della questione di fiducia.

Forse l'alta velocità, forse la perdita di controllo dell'auto, sta di fatto, signor Presidente, che il mezzo meccanico esce di strada, sbatte violentemente contro un muro in cemento armato e l'auto comincia a prendere fuoco. Quando l'auto ribaltata era già in fiamme, giungono sul luogo dell'incidente Jacopo, 18 anni, e subito dopo Nicola, di 20. Le loro strade si sono incrociate probabilmente per un disegno divino. L'istinto, la voglia di salvare ragazzi come loro: hanno trascinato fuori dall'abitacolo prima Stefania e poi Giordano, privi di sensi ed impossibilitati a salvarsi da soli. Celermente sono arrivati i carabinieri, i vigili del fuoco e le autoambulanze; si sono recati sul luogo dell'incidente, ma l'auto era completamente carbonizzata.

Signor Presidente, sono sconfortanti, purtroppo, i dati di questa Relazione presentata dal Governo. Che finiva così, onestamente noi della Lega Nord l'avevamo già detto in sede di dichiarazione di voto al cosiddetto decreto salva Italia, che tutti hanno applaudito tranne noi. Sapevamo che finiva così: ma perché? In un anno, il rapporto debito-<PARTY>L è passato dal 120 al 134 per cento, con ben 14 punti di peggioramento. Per dare un'idea, colleghi, i Governi della spesa allegra - Craxi e Forlani, per intenderci - in un anno avevano aumentato tale rapporto di quattro punti: qui, invece, in un anno siamo riusciti a fare tre volte peggio di quei Governi. Come mai? Anche questo, però, l'avevamo già detto: vi è una regola banale, che conosce chiunque si occupi minimamente di finanza pubblica, ossia che ogni 15 miliardi di euro di tasse in più, il <PARTY>L cala di almeno un punto, se non oltre. Abbiamo messo una valanga di tasse e purtroppo questo è esattamente quello che è successo. Vi faccio un esempio su mille, relativo alle barche, che, come sapete, per definizione si spostano. Quando venne introdotta una tassazione molto forte sulle barche, dicemmo: «Guardate che c'è un problema». Lì il Governo prevedeva di incassare 200 milioni di euro, ma in realtà ne ha incassati solo 20, perché le barche si sono spostate e 200 milioni sono stati spesi. Inoltre, abbiamo perso 1 miliardo di euro per l'indotto, perché abbiamo perso commesse importanti: quindi, per incassare 20 milioni di euro, ne abbiamo persi 1.180. È un esempio, che serve giusto per far capire gli errori che sono stati fatti e che hanno portato a questa situazione. La stessa cosa è avvenuta per l'auto e per l'IMU sulla casa, e sappiamo tutti come va il settore immobiliare. Ebbene, oltre a questo c'è un altro fenomeno che avevamo contestato. L'anno scorso abbiamo dato 46 miliardi di euro (quindi 46.000 milioni, una cifra enorme) alle banche di mezza Europa e quattro miliardi di euro al Monte dei Paschi di Siena, per un totale di 50 miliardi di euro. Chiaramente anche questi hanno inciso parecchio in quel rapporto. Visto che possiamo dare 50 miliardi di euro alle banche di mezza Europa, santa pace, è giusto che finalmente ne diamo 40 alle nostre imprese. <p> Purtroppo li diamo in due anni, e speriamo che arrivino davvero alle imprese (ma questo lo approfondiremo). <p> Parliamo quindi di pagamenti. Già oggi, facendo un altro esempio, la Regione Lombardia paga a 30 giorni, quindi non avrebbe bisogno del decreto-legge; paga a 60 giorni i debiti sanitari, ma il nostro obiettivo è di portare in un paio d'anni anche quelli al pagamento a 30 giorni. Quindi, no problem per la Regione, però i Comuni del Nord, della Lombardia ma non solo, i Comuni di un po' tutto il Paese che hanno i soldi in cassa non possono pagare, non per colpa loro, ma perché c'è una regola stupida: c'è il Patto di stabilità che glielo impedisce. Ora, se una regola è sbagliata, cambiamola, non ci sono più scuse; questa è la volta buona e quindi questa regola va cambiata. D'altronde, avendo già previsto il pareggio di bilancio obbligatorio anche per i Comuni e gli enti locali con la riforma delle norme di contabilità, a questo punto non ha senso imporre ulteriori vincoli come il Patto di stabilità. Vedremo quindi il testo del decreto-legge e ci auguriamo che in esso questi problemi vengano finalmente risolti. Ciò che più conta, però, è che la liquidità arrivi davvero alle imprese. Colleghi, immaginiamoci un bel campo con tanti canali che lo irrigano tutto. Non quei canali di cemento dove l'acqua scorre e arriva fino in fondo: canali di terra, fatti nella terra, in cui purtroppo, quando la terra è secca perché la siccità dura da un paio d'anni, anche se si mette acqua nel canale, il terreno se la beve tutta e non arriva in fondo al campo. Qui siamo nella stessa situazione: il rischio è che, pagata la prima impresa, questa non paghi i fornitori, limitandosi a migliorare la propria situazione bancaria e gli affidamenti. Quindi avremmo risolto poco, veramente molto poco. Pertanto, noi della Lega Nord faremo di tutto e approfondiremo il testo perché vogliamo che l'acqua arrivi in fondo al campo. Noi vogliamo che la liquidità arrivi ai piccoli e medio-piccoli Comuni e non solo ai grandi e alle grandi Regioni indebitate; vogliamo quindi che arrivi ovunque nella pubblica amministrazione, ma soprattutto alle piccole e medie imprese, all'economia reale. Questo sarà lo sforzo che la Lega Nord - e mi auguro tutto il Senato - farà nell'affrontare questo importante decreto-legge.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7631359100341797, 0.23686407506465912]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> CENTINAIO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, il combinato disposto degli articoli 29 (che, lo ricordo, prevede che la famiglia sia una società naturale fondata sul matrimonio), 30 e 31 della Costituzione enunciano in modo inequivocabile il regime preferenziale della famiglia quale nucleo fondamentale della società. Stando all'ultimo rapporto ISTAT, che ha diffuso gli indici demografici, le nascite in Italia continuano a calare: nel 2015 sono state 488.000. La media del numero dei figli per donna è di 1,35 al 2015 e si conferma questo trend in calo. La capacità dei genitori di investire sul futuro dei figli dipende da molti fattori, tra questi il loro stato occupazionale, di salute, il livello di istruzione raggiunto ed il sostegno nei compiti di cura che la comunità offre loro. La possibilità di disporre di competenze e risorse, non solo economiche, è essenziale, soprattutto nei primi anni di vita del bambino, quando l'offerta educativa e di relazione è decisiva per farne emergere le potenzialità. La denatalità in Europa è ormai un'emergenza. Entro il 2025 i primi Paesi europei - Italia, Spagna, Germania e Grecia - potrebbero sperimentare l'implosione demografica, ovvero la diminuzione effettiva della popolazione. Ciò non si risolverà con la legge che avete approvato ieri. È necessario affrontare in maniera sistematica la prima e più importante esigenza, rappresentata dall'avere una famiglia, cioè esistere. L'obiettivo principale deve essere quello di incentivare la natalità attraverso una serie di strumenti che intervengano nella fascia di età più delicata del bambino, ossia fino al compimento del terzo anno di età. Questa fascia di età è delicata in termini educativi e di richiesta di attenzioni e cure, nonché in ragione della maggiore difficoltà di conciliare le esigenze familiari con quelle lavorative. È necessario conferire piena attuazione all'articolo 31 della Costituzione, che sancisce che «La Repubblica agevola con misure economiche e altre provvidenze la formazione della famiglia e l'adempimento dei compiti relativi (...)».

Ebbene, in un periodo in cui si stenta ad avere riferimenti al di fuori del Comune (perché non si capisce, in questa grande ingegneria costituzionale che stiamo tutti cercando di mettere in pratica, quali siano gli enti intermedi), io ho visto il Comune capoluogo del mio territorio diventare un perno e diventare quella che spesso, a parole, definiamo area vasta, senza sapere cosa sia. L'azione di Lecce Capitale della cultura è diventata l'area vasta per un territorio che non è solo quello provinciale, ma quello di un comprensorio molto più largo. Ebbene, la parte finale della mozione, laddove si dice che bisogna andare oltre la contingenza della designazione di una singola città quale Capitale della cultura, andando a premiare lo sforzo di tutte le città, diventa l'elemento che contraddistingue non solo la mozione, ma la nostra capacità di stare dietro a questi Comuni e di realizzare una buona prassi, che non valga solo per queste 21 città, ma che diventi poi modello per realizzare in materia, non solo di programmazione culturale, ma sicuramente in primis di programmazione culturale, uno schema da seguire e da definire come schema consueto che esalti la capacità di programmazione degli amministratori locali e valorizzi una programmazione culturale. Per questi motivi, signora Presidente, ho dato la mia adesione convinta alla mozione n. 182.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5227600932121277, 0.4772398769855499]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori, l'ora è tarda però vorrei utilizzare il tempo a mia disposizione per soffermarmi, prima di entrare nel merito del provvedimento, su due aspetti per me fondamentali. <p> In primo luogo, desidero ribadire la piena solidarietà e il sostegno del Gruppo Forza Italia - e penso di poter parlare a nome di tutto il popolo italiano - al popolo ucraino e sottolineare come l'Italia, insieme a tutti i Paesi alleati, stia cercando una soluzione diplomatica, che rimane la via maestra per risolvere questa crisi. Al contempo, vorrei dire che è un diritto e un nostro dovere aiutare le vittime che non possono difendersi da sole dall'aggressione e anche in questo caso l'Italia a mio avviso sta facendo la sua parte. <p> Il secondo aspetto è rappresentato dalle ricadute economiche che questa guerra, che ormai dura da oltre due mesi, ha sulla nostra economia. In Italia i rincari di petrolio, gas e carbone stanno facendo crescere i costi delle imprese e questo impatto si traduce in un aumento della bolletta energetica italiana di 5,7 miliardi su base mensile, ovvero in un maggior onere di 68 miliardi su base annua. Finora le imprese hanno in gran parte assorbito questi aumenti dei costi nei propri margini, in certi casi fino ad annullarli, invece di scaricarli, come si dovrebbe, sulle fasi successive della produzione. I margini erosi spiegano perché l'inflazione in Italia è ancora bassa. L'unico aspetto positivo è che questo andamento di prezzi e margini ha salvaguardato la competitività delle imprese italiane rispetto a quelle di altri Paesi, ma a mio parere questo processo non è sostenibile per un lungo periodo. Per questo diverse imprese stanno purtroppo riducendo o fermando la produzione o prevedono di farlo nei prossimi mesi. <p> D'altra parte, i rincari dei prezzi energetici comprimono il potere d'acquisto delle famiglie e ciò influirà sull'ampiezza e sul ritmo di crescita dei consumi, il cui recupero è stato prima ostacolato dall'aumento dei contagi e ora anche dalla maggiore incertezza che influenza la fiducia, che a marzo, come abbiamo visto tutti, è crollata. <p> Un altro impatto della guerra deriva dalle sanzioni o controsanzioni: l'impatto diretto delle sanzioni alla Russia sull' export italiano è complessivamente modesto; il blocco riguarda 686 milioni di euro di vendite in Russia, pari all'8,9 per cento dell' export italiano nel Paese, che a sua volta rappresenta l'1,5 per cento del totale dell' export italiano. Quello che preoccupa, però, è che ci sono alcuni specifici prodotti italiani, ad esempio alcuni macchinari, per i quali il peso del mercato russo supera il 10 per cento; pertanto, se l'impatto totale del mancato export italiano verso la Russia è sostenibile, non lo è invece per quelle imprese italiane che hanno nel mercato russo il destinatario principale, se non esclusivo, dei loro prodotti o servizi. L'andamento del <PARTY>L nel 2022 risulta molto meno favorevole di quanto precedentemente stimato: quest'anno si registrerebbe un incremento dell'1,9 per cento, con un'ampia revisione al ribasso, pari a circa il 2,2 per cento, rispetto allo scenario delineato lo scorso ottobre, quando tutti i previsori erano concordi sul 4 per cento. Contestualmente, preoccupa il rialzo dei tassi, in quanto farà crescere gradualmente la spesa per interessi, quindi ci sarà meno spazio di bilancio per mettere in campo manovre espansive. Si rischia quindi di tornare a politiche prudenti per evitare aumenti dello spread, che comunque è già è molto in salita. Nel decreto-legge in esame il Governo ha provveduto a mettere in campo molte misure importanti, che ometto di ricordare, perché sono state già ampiamente descritte sia dai relatori sia dai nostri colleghi senatori. Permettetemi però una riflessione sui bonus, anche visto l'ultimo decreto-legge aiuti che dev'essere emanato. A mio modo di vedere, forse sarebbe necessario un riordino di tutti questi bonus. Solo per il 2022 ne abbiamo addirittura oltre 40, dal bonus bancomat al bonus autobus, solo per fare due esempi. Sono misure tampone, mentre in questo momento servirebbero una visione complessiva e, soprattutto, interventi strutturali per il rilancio del nostro Paese. In Commissione - e qui ringrazio i presidenti D'Alfonso e Girotto, i relatori Tiraboschi e Fenu, nonché tutti i colleghi della Commissione - abbiamo cercato di fare un proficuo lavoro di approfondimento e di sintesi per trovare soluzioni ad almeno alcune questioni che riteniamo importanti, proprio per cercare di dare una visione che vada oltre l'emergenza immediata. Lasciatemi ora approfondire alcuni degli emendamenti che sono stati approvati, tra cui, innanzitutto, quello riferito a una questione molto rilevante, come quella dei servizi di comunicazione basati sulla tecnologia 5G. Siamo intervenuti in questo caso con dei correttivi, a mio modo di vedere molto significativi. Il decreto nella sua formulazione iniziale - voglio ricordarlo - prevedeva l'obbligo di trasmettere una notifica comprensiva della programmazione annuale di acquisti, ma questo appare incompatibile con la possibilità delle imprese di fornire sin da subito informazioni tecniche dettagliate. Abbiamo quindi ritenuto necessario espungere dall'articolato il riferimento al grado di dettaglio dell'informazione trasmessa e di esplicitare in un'ottica di semplificazione l'esclusione dall'obbligo di notifica le acquisizioni che comportano la mera estensione di beni o servizi relativi a contratti in essere già notificati secondo la vecchia procedura o comunque già approvati. Per lo stesso motivo, la previsione di aggiornamento del piano annuale con cadenza quadrimestrale, contenuta nel testo originale del decreto, rappresentava un eccessivo irrigidimento. Abbiamo quindi voluto garantire agli operatori di proseguire senza incertezze nelle consuete attività legate allo sviluppo delle reti 5G e in quest'ottica, proprio per non ingessare l'attività di tali imprese, abbiamo eliminato il riferimento all'aggiornamento su base quadrimestrale, prevedendo che questo avvenga nel corso dell'anno senza finestre temporali. Forza Italia è intervenuta inoltre per salvare i lavori ammessi a usufruire di agevolazioni fiscali nel campo dell'edilizia, come ad esempio ecobonus, sismabonus o bonus facciate. Con un emendamento, a mia prima firma, abbiamo introdotto l'obbligo per le imprese esecutrici dei lavori di importo superiore a 516.000 di possedere il requisito di qualificazione delle società organismi di attestazione (SOA), analogamente a quanto già oggi previsto per tutti i lavori di ricostruzione sismica. Consentitemi di fare chiarezza su questo emendamento. Garantire regolarità e standard di qualità non significa implementare ulteriormente la burocrazia per queste aziende, ma dare qualità e, soprattutto, sicurezza sul lavoro. In questo modo sarà possibile distinguere le imprese serie da quelle improvvisate, che magari - voglio ricordarlo, perché è successo negli ultimi mesi - hanno cambiato codice Ateco all'ultimo momento per mero opportunismo, trasformando aziende decotte in false aziende edili, producendo profitti molto elevati. Inoltre, per salvaguardare le imprese piccole e diligenti abbiamo inserito un lasso temporale, fino al 31 dicembre 2022, in cui non ci sarà nessun cambiamento della norma, mentre dal 1° gennaio al 30 giugno 2023 basterà la richiesta della domanda di certificazione. Solo dal 1° luglio scatterà la norma. Un altro miglioramento va incontro a un'esigenza molto sentita dal mondo produttivo e voglio ringraziare in maniera particolare il sottosegretario Freni e la sottosegretaria Guerra, con cui abbiamo lavorato alacremente, per aver accolto la nostra richiesta. A giugno, voglio ricordarlo, migliaia di imprese si sarebbero trovate a dover pagare le rate in quota capitale dei finanziamenti accesi con garanzia dello Stato in base al cosiddetto decreto cura Italia. Siamo riusciti a prorogare di ulteriori sei mesi lo spazio temporale per iniziare a pagare. Quindi la misura porterà il pagamento delle rate da ventiquattro a trentasei mesi.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6598821878433228, 0.34011784195899963]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> FREGOLENT (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, colleghi, rappresentanti del Governo, innanzitutto anche da parte nostra va un ringraziamento alla senatrice Binetti e a tutti i membri della Commissione sanità per l'ordine del giorno unitario che ci apprestiamo a votare. I temi sono stati ampiamente illustrati nei vari interventi che si sono succeduti e vorrei soffermarmi sui tumori pediatrici condividendo una riflessione che parte dall'amore di un genitore per il proprio figlio, un amore incondizionato, che non può essere spiegato, ma si può solo vivere. Lo si conosce quando si ha la fortuna di vedere quel bimbo tra le braccia per la prima volta e rimane per sempre. Per questo si dice che non esista cosa più dolorosa per un genitore che perdere un figlio. Ecco l'anomalia: l'aumento dei tumori in età pediatrica e adolescenziale. L'associazione italiana registri tumori stima che nel quinquennio 2016-2020 in Italia siano state diagnosticate 7.000 neoplasie tra i bambini e 4.000 tra gli adolescenti tra i quindici e i diciannove anni, in linea con il quinquennio precedente. Quando si incontra uno di quei genitori che hanno trasformato un tale dolore nella missione di una vita, per aiutare altre giovani vite, la domanda che viene spontaneo porsi è: quali sono le priorità di questo Paese? Quanto conta il nostro correre quotidiano di fronte alla sofferenza di certe persone? Ma soprattutto, stiamo facendo tutto quello che possiamo sui temi della salute e della ricerca? Noi, come Gruppo, crediamo di no. Siamo convinti che si potrebbe fare di più e meglio, se fossimo tutti onesti nel riconoscere le priorità e lavorassimo con norme stringenti per marginalizzare le inappropriatezze, perché ogni risorsa gestita male è una mancata risposta a un nostro concittadino. <p> Alcune delle cose che chiediamo sono talmente basilari che stupisce la necessità di doverle ribadire. In particolare, mi riferisco alla corretta e uniforme presa in carico del paziente oncologico pediatrico, promuovendo a livello territoriale l'approccio multidisciplinare e il lavoro di équipe, con la presenza di diversi specialisti e con l'obiettivo di garantire e migliorare il benessere psicofisico del paziente e della propria famiglia. Un'indagine condotta in Italia dalla fondazione Soleterre ONLUS e dall'unità di ricerca sul trauma dell'Università Cattolica di Milano, dal novembre 2019 al settembre 2021, su adolescenti tra i dodici e i ventitré anni, presso l'unità operativa di oncoematologia pediatrica del Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia, ha evidenziato ansia e depressione clinicamente significative. Come potrebbe essere diversamente? È già difficile quando tali patologie oncologiche colpiscono da adulti; immaginiamoci quando si è nel fiore degli anni. Ecco che risulta fondamentale l'assistenza psicologica dei pazienti pediatrici e delle loro famiglie nell'ambito dei reparti di oncologia medica, effettuata da laureati abilitati in psicologia. Risulta necessario e fondamentale però che il nostro Paese, attraverso l'azione del Governo, si impegni per sostenere la ricerca scientifica. La legge sulle malattie rare è un primo passo, ma dobbiamo fare di più per lo sviluppo di nuove terapie: stanziare fondi per farmaci oncologici pediatrici innovativi; attivare protocolli di cura sperimentali e sviluppare studi clinici mediante un approccio terapeutico multidisciplinare. Inoltre, è necessario prevedere lo stanziamento di fondi volti al supporto economico delle famiglie a basso reddito, considerando i costi che devono sostenere in caso di ricoveri presso centri di cura distanti dalla propria residenza. Quest'ultimo aspetto ci porta inevitabilmente al tema dell'equità di accesso alle cure: nessuno dovrebbe avere maggiore o minore possibilità di curarsi in base a dove nasce. Al Parlamento quindi spetta il compito di individuare regole certe di responsabilizzazione e di corretto impiego delle risorse per fare in modo che tutte le Regioni offrano risposte efficienti ai propri concittadini, senza abbassare l'asticella dell'efficacia delle risposte e pretendendo che tutta la filiera, dal vertice dirigenziale ai... <p> Concludo, signor Presidente. Bisogna pretendere che tutta la filiera, dal vertice dirigenziale al singolo operatore sociosanitario (OSS), lavori in tutte le Regioni verso un unico obiettivo, quello di garantire la salute di ognuno di noi. <p> Per tutti questi motivi, annuncio il voto favorevole del Gruppo <PARTY> a quest'ordine del giorno.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6097783446311951, 0.3902216851711273]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> GUALDANI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori, il decreto-legge che ci accingiamo a convertire è un provvedimento importante per gli enti territoriali, soprattutto in questo momento in cui gli stessi sono più che mai gravati da urgenti problemi finanziari che rischiano di compromettere l'equilibrio dei loro bilanci e soprattutto l'erogazione dei servizi ai cittadini. Tutti gli interventi presenti nel testo del decreto-legge sono improntati a dare maggiore respiro agli enti locali e a sottrarli alla morsa degli stringenti vincoli legati al rispetto del Patto di stabilità interno. Il decreto-legge interviene su tutti i livelli territoriali che compongono la struttura repubblicana. Per quanto riguarda i Comuni si recepisce l'intesa Stato, Città ed autonomie locali e vengono concessi ulteriori spazi finanziari per taluni tipi di investimento ritenuti non più prorogabili, come la bonifica dell'amianto nelle scuole. Sono state rideterminate in diminuzione le sanzioni per i Comuni che non hanno rispettato nell'anno 2014 i vincoli del Patto di stabilità interno, consistenti nella riduzione del fondo sperimentale di riequilibrio o del fondo perequativo in misura pari alla differenza tra il risultato registrato e l'obiettivo programmatico predeterminato. La nuova sanzione si applica nella misura pari al 20 per cento della differenza tra il saldo obiettivo del 2014 ed il saldo finanziario conseguito nello stesso anno. Si tratta di una riduzione delle sanzioni per il mancato rispetto del Patto di stabilità, che non comporta però il venir meno completo delle sanzioni stesse, onde tutelare il principio di cogenza del Patto. Per l'anno 2015, per far fronte ai danni causati dalla tromba d'aria che l'8 luglio 2015 ha interessato i Comuni di Dolo, Pianiga e Mira in Veneto, l'obiettivo del Patto di stabilità interno di ciascuno dei predetti Comuni è stato ridotto per importi necessari a garantire una celere ricostruzione delle infrastrutture e delle attività commerciali colpite. È rimasto aperto ed irrisolto il problema della fiscalità locale, che sarà auspicabilmente affrontato con la prossima legge di stabilità, che dovrà introdurre un'unica local tax per la semplificazione degli adempimenti fiscali dei cittadini. Invece, con questo provvedimento si è data solo una parziale risposta sul tema dell'IMU agricola, il cui pagamento è stato differito al 30 ottobre senza sanzioni. Sulle Provincie e Città metropolitane il decreto-legge è stato notevolmente migliorato dal Senato, che si è fatto carico di una situazione molto critica che avrebbe causato il default di gran parte degli enti. La riforma Del Rio, infatti, non ha ancora trovato piena attenzione da parte delle Regioni che non hanno ancora provveduto ad emanare le leggi regionali per la ridistribuzione delle funzioni. Pertanto, tutte le funzioni, non solo quelle fondamentali, sono rimaste in capo alle Province che però hanno subito pesanti tagli con la legge di stabilità. <p> (ore 17,43) ( Segue GUALDANI). Il lavoro in Senato ha cercato di rimediare a questi problemi prevedendo norme eccezionali per l'anno 2015 e mettendo in mora le Regioni che non approvino tempestivamente le leggi regionali di riordino. Ad esempio, si è consentito alle Province e alle Città metropolitane che non abbiano rispettato il Patto di stabilità per il 2014 di stipulare per l'anno in corso nuovi contratti a tempo determinato, con termine previsto per il 31 dicembre 2015, a condizione che venga garantito l'equilibrio di parte corrente nel periodo interessato. Con questo correttivo gli enti di area vasta possono rinnovare i contratti precari, il cui blocco aveva provocato non poche proteste nel corso del 2014. Inoltre sono state risolte le questioni relative a due categorie di dipendenti delle Province e Città metropolitane: quelli della polizia provinciale e dei centri per l'impiego. Nel processo generale di riassetto dell'organico dei dipendenti delle Province in via di soppressione, si è previsto che il personale delle Province che si trovi comandato o distaccato alla data del 31 dicembre 2014 presso altra pubblica amministrazione sia trasferito presso di essa, ferma restando la garanzia della sostenibilità finanziaria a regime della spesa. In merito alla questione del ricollocamento della polizia provinciale, si è previsto che gli enti di area vasta e le Città metropolitane individuino il personale di polizia provinciale necessario per l'esercizio delle loro funzioni fondamentali, entro una riallocazione di funzioni di polizia amministrativa disposta da leggi regionali. Qualora al 31 ottobre 2015 vi sia personale di polizia provinciale non individuato o non riallocato, scatta il trasferimento ai Comuni, singoli e associati. Sui servizi per l'impiego si è previsto la conclusione di un accordo tra il Governo, le Regioni e le Province autonome, relativo ad un piano di rafforzamento degli stessi, ai fini dell'erogazione delle politiche attive, mediante l'impiego coordinato di fondi nazionali e regionali, nonché delle risorse di programmi operativi cofinanziati da fondi europei. Le Province e le Città metropolitane possono stipulare, ai fini del funzionamento dei centri per l'impiego, contratti di lavoro a tempo determinato, con scadenza non successiva al 31 dicembre 2016, anche nel caso di mancato rispetto del Patto di stabilità interno per l'anno 2014. Ricordiamo anche i finanziamenti per la Regione Siciliana per far fronte al calo di gettito IRPEF. Ricordiamo anche che il provvedimento inoltre fornisce altre risposte importanti ai territori colpiti dalle gravissime calamità degli ultimi anni, dal terremoto dell'Abruzzo del 2009, al terremoto della Lombardia ed Emilia Romagna del 2012, all'alluvione della Sardegna del 2013, con lo scopo di rendere trasparenti e veloci le ricostruzioni anche attraverso l'istituzione di zone franche urbane a cui destinare importanti risorse per investimento. A tal proposito Area Popolare condivide l'esigenza non più prorogabile di intervenire con una normativa quadro sugli eventi calamitosi che consenta di stabilire misure uguali per tutti i territori che scattino automaticamente al verificarsi di determinate condizioni. Importanti anche le ulteriori risorse stanziate per i pagamenti arretrati di Regioni ed enti locali nei confronti delle imprese nonché tutte le misure previste per l'avvio della carta di identità elettronica. Ricordiamo anche che la Commissione durante i suoi lavori ha cercato di garantire al meglio anche la soluzione dell'annosa questione dell'operatività delle agenzie fiscali, prevedendo la possibilità di indire concorsi pubblici per la copertura delle vacanze organiche di dirigenti. Per garantire le esigenze di funzionalità operativa attuali ha previsto la possibilità di delegare, previa procedura selettiva con criteri oggettivi e trasparenti, a funzionari della terza area, con un'esperienza professionale di almeno cinque anni nell'area stessa, le funzioni relative agli uffici di cui hanno assunto la direzione interinale e i connessi poteri di adozione di atti per un periodo che non ecceda il 31 dicembre 2016. Infine, in tema di sicurezza si proroga fino al 31 dicembre 2015 l'impiego di personale militare appartenente alle Forze armate per compiti di vigilanza a siti e obiettivi sensibili, nell'ambito delle operazioni «Strade sicure» e «Terra dei Fuochi». In vista soprattutto delle esigenze di carattere straordinario legate al Giubileo, è stata anche autorizzata l'assunzione straordinaria di 1.050 unità nella Polizia di Stato, di 1.050 unità nell'Arma dei carabinieri, di 400 unità nella Guardia di finanza, per ciascuno degli anni 2015 e 2016. Il provvedimento, signora Presidente, è ricco di contenuti e spunti che costituiscono un buon punto di partenza per la ripresa degli enti territoriali; siamo consapevoli che il discorso non finisce qui e che ulteriori misure dovranno essere prese nella prossima manovra finanziaria. Sicuri dell'azione riformatrice del Governo, Area Popolare voterà a favore del provvedimento, certi che nella prossima legge di stabilità verranno sciolti i nodi lasciati ancora aperti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5099034309387207, 0.4900965094566345]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> MARINELLO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, questa non è la prima volta in cui Governo e Parlamento si occupano della questione ILVA. Speriamo che sia la volta buona, la volta definitiva. Auspichiamo che con la rapida approvazione del provvedimento si riesca a perseguire in modo efficace l'obiettivo di tenere insieme l'attività produttiva del più grande polo siderurgico europeo con una capacità produttiva di 8 milioni di tonnellate annue di acciaio, un terzo quindi del fabbisogno nazionale, con la continuità occupazionale di un gruppo che, tra diretti e indiretti, occupa complessivamente oltre 16.000 addetti, senza far venire meno il risanamento ambientale dello stabilimento e della città di Taranto. Ritengo che il lavoro svolto da entrambe le Commissioni oggi ci consenta di approvare un provvedimento indubbiamente rafforzato rispetto al testo iniziale del decreto-legge, grazie ad un lavoro proficuo svolto, appunto, dalle Commissioni industria e ambiente e da tutti i Gruppi parlamentari che hanno contribuito a rendere più efficace questo provvedimento e grazie anche all'apporto positivo di una serie di soggetti auditi, forze sociali, soggetti istituzionali, le istituzioni locali, i commissari straordinari dell'ILVA per la bonifica della città di Taranto e gli stessi magistrati di Milano e di Taranto. Ci siamo trovati ad affrontare un provvedimento molto difficile e complesso perché l'argomento ILVA, di fatto, deve rispondere, o dovrebbe rispondere, ad una serie di esigenze che non sono statiche, almeno nella nostra visione, ma assolutamente dinamiche: l'esigenza di tutelare il diritto dei lavoratori al lavoro, l'esigenza di tutelare il diritto all'impresa, l'esigenza di tutelare il diritto alla salute dei cittadini, oltre che ovviamente dei lavoratori, e il diritto alla tutela dell'ambiente. Si tratta di diritti costituzionalmente garantiti e riuscire a trovare, in una situazione così difficile, il punto di caduta, il punto di equilibrio ovviamente richiede una serie di mediazioni, una serie di verifiche non sempre facili. Teniamo anche presente che il provvedimento legislativo seppur denso, pieno, di contenuti e seppur prevedendo tutta una serie di impegni e risorse assolutamente certe e quantificabili, evidentemente tiene conto anche delle risorse disponibili. Mi rendo conto che avremmo potuto fare di più e meglio, ma avremmo potuto fare di più e meglio con ben altre risorse. Evidentemente l'attività parlamentare deve tenere conto della realtà dei fatti e delle cose. Aggiungo una sottolineatura molto importante: ieri, nel corso del dibattito che ha preceduto la discussione generale, cioè nel momento delle cosiddette pregiudiziali di costituzionalità, i Gruppi di opposizione hanno incentrato il loro intervento prevalentemente su una questione fondamentale, cioè sulle guarentigie che vanno assicurate, e che questo decreto assicura, ai commissari non soltanto nella gestione dell'impianto ma anche nella gestione delle bonifiche. Vivaddio noi ci rendiamo conto che il problema va affrontato non con un atteggiamento squisitamente teorico, ma assolutamente con il senso pratico che dovrebbe guidare e determinare il buonsenso non soltanto nella vita comune ma specialmente della vita politica e nell'attività parlamentare. Si tratta di una situazione difficilissima, complessa, che di fatto è al di fuori della legalità, così come acclarano decine e decine di inchieste che hanno interessato non soltanto l'ILVA ma anche diverse procure della Repubblica su tutto il territorio nazionale. Una questione che, evidentemente, pone delle serie difficoltà a chi deve assume delle decisioni e a chi deve assumere il ruolo di comando della cabina di regia. Evidentemente tale questione non può essere affrontata in maniera ordinaria. È di tutta evidenza che andavano assicurate alcune garanzie e questo è il senso di quanto contenuto nel provvedimento. Noi condividiamo pienamente la ratio di questa iniziativa legislativa proprio perché ci rendiamo conto che rappresenta la precondizione di una gestione, di una governance della società che possa quantomeno liberare i piloti e registi dalla preoccupazione giornaliera di dover infrangere quotidianamente la legge. Evidentemente tutto questo non può essere garantito per sempre: verrà il momento in cui questa fase straordinaria rientrerà nell'ordinarietà della gestione e allora quella sarà tutt'altra partita. Questi sono i motivi per cui invito tutti i colleghi, anche nel pieno ed assoluto rispetto della divergenza di opinioni e della diversità di posizioni politiche, a non far passare messaggi fuorvianti che al di fuori di quest'Aula possono dare un'idea diversa delle cose, suscitando delle emozioni o delle impressioni non rispondenti al vero. Queste sono le motivazioni principali per cui il Gruppo <PARTY> voterà convintamente il provvedimento, rinnovando la fiducia al Governo.

Come ha detto il collega Zaffini prima, non è certo nostra intenzione mettere le bandierine su chi prima ha fatto o meno certe battaglie; non ci interessa. <p> Di sicuro ci troviamo di fronte a una situazione molto pericolosa che riguarda la cosiddetta fase 2. Abbiamo visto cosa è successo nella fase 1 e nella situazione a essa precedente. Questo ci dovrebbe porre nella condizione di imparare cosa è successo ed eventualmente agire di conseguenza. <p> Nella nostra mozione abbiamo indicato come affrontare la cosiddetta fase 2 e i pericoli di un ritorno del virus sul nostro territorio; è la madre di tutte le battaglie, caro vice Ministro e onorevoli senatori. Potremmo intavolare qualsiasi tipo di discussione sul rilancio economico della nostra Nazione - e noi siamo in prima fila anche con tante proposte al riguardo - ma, se il virus e l'emergenza sanitaria ritornano, sorgeranno problemi per tutta la nostra Nazione. È un problema che difficilmente riusciremo a risolvere con interventi di carattere economico a causa della paura creatasi fra i nostri concittadini, come stiamo rilevando in questi giorni di prime riaperture delle varie attività nelle nostre città anche d'arte ancora vuote. Non solo i turisti stranieri, ma anche molti italiani hanno difficoltà a muoversi da Regione a Regione per timore del virus. E questa è la realtà dei fatti. Quindi, diventa importante da parte dello Stato un intervento forte sui temi della prevenzione del virus, visto che non abbiamo la possibilità di avere ancora un vaccino e nemmeno una cura certa. Anche se le mozioni presentano delle valide iniziative da parte del personale del mondo scientifico sugli interventi e le modalità da intraprendere per migliorare la cura del virus, di certo non abbiamo ancora niente in mano. <p> Diventa quindi fondamentale la fase della prevenzione. <p> L'Organizzazione mondiale della sanità ci dice di testare, trattare e tracciare, e questi non possono essere slogan vuoti. Non ci possiamo trovare in una condizione di emergenza quale è stata la cosiddetta prima fase (la fase delle chiusure) senza sapere dove andare e cosa fare; adesso abbiamo chiaro il quadro di cosa fare. Caro Vice Ministro, bisogna anche prendere come esempio quanto di positivo è stato fatto nelle altre Nazioni. Non sono convinto che l'Italia abbia agito peggio di molti altri Stati, ma sono convinto che qualche altro Stato abbia agito meglio dell'Italia nella fase emergenziale, e faccio l'esempio della Germania. Se non mettiamo in atto nei prossimi mesi quello che è stato fatto in quel Paese, diventa difficile bloccare un eventuale ritorno del virus. Parlo anzitutto della necessità di potenziare la medicina sul territorio, cioè i medici di base e chi si trova in prima linea e in frontiera nel combattere il nemico. E poi è necessario potenziare gli interventi di screening, ed è questo l'oggetto della nostra mozione, e anche di altre. Non ci possiamo fermare, cari rappresentanti del Governo, signor Presidente, a un intervento spot su 150.000 persone in Italia; diventa troppo poco. In Germania è stato effettuato uno screening pesante sulla popolazione attraverso i tamponi e l'iniziativa sierologica. Anche l'altro aspetto di cui parlava il collega Zaffini prima non è di secondaria importanza, perché lo screening è una cosa, mentre l'intervento diagnostico è successivo ad esso. I cittadini che lo vogliono devono poter usufruire anche di test rapidi da reperire nelle farmacie, per certificare la prima fase, a seguito della quale si passa poi alla fase diagnostica. Tutti questi mezzi - secondo me - possono garantire qualcosa di importante e fornire anche maggiore sicurezza ai cittadini. A proposito dell' app Immuni, cari rappresentanti del Governo, siete stati per giorni e giorni a raccontarci se l' app vale o non vale; ma, se alla fine la gente non la scarica, essa diventa inutile. In Germania si è seguita non questa strada, ma quella del potenziamento della medicina di base sul territorio, facendo in modo di tracciare tutti coloro risultati positivi (mi riferisco al tracciamento del virus ed è stata creata una task force di 20.000 persone per effettuare i controlli. Abbiamo visto adesso che i numeri sono molto bassi; quando sono uno, due o cinque i casi di nuovi contagi, si potrebbero controllare tutte le persone che hanno frequentato quei soggetti. Ovviamente ci sono anche le persone asintomatiche ed è per questo che sono importanti le nostre richieste di potenziare le fasi dello screening e poi quella della diagnostica, che devono andare di pari passo. D'altra parte, non è una battaglia che abbiamo iniziato a combattere solo adesso. Già nel corso dell'esame del decreto cura Italia avevamo presentato un emendamento in questa direzione, in cui era previsto anche un finanziamento che poi abbiamo trasformato in un ordine del giorno, accolto dal Governo, che prevede lo stanziamento di 250 milioni di euro per potenziare le fasi dello screening e della diagnostica, con la possibilità di finanziare le Regioni per seguire questa strada. Signor Vice Ministro, in questa fase in cui il virus sembra essere meno aggressivo, potremmo sviluppare questi temi. Vediamo che a volte la discussione al riguardo è molto ampia; il mio consiglio è di evitare di fare quanto è successo nei mesi scorsi, con personaggi del mondo accademico e della sanità che in televisione dicono un po' di tutto. Non parlo di lei, signor Vice Ministro, perché lei ha sempre parlato di questi temi con grande preparazione e in maniera molto moderata e tranquilla, senza voler mai apparire come colui che ha la verità in tasca. Troppe persone, però, ci hanno lasciato stupiti nel vedere cosa stava accadendo tra chi doveva governare la fase emergenziale. Abbiamo sentito accademici dire tutto e il contrario di tutto. Non è più possibile, né accettabile procedere nei prossimi mesi in questa direzione, perché così si crea allarmismo fra le persone. Se non c'è la sicurezza della direzione in cui si va, si creano problemi incredibili che difficilmente possono essere risolti anche con interventi di carattere economico. Infatti, le ricadute dell'emergenza sanitaria possono essere veramente pesanti; sappiamo tutti - e lo stiamo valutando in questi giorni - cosa sta accadendo. Abbiamo presentato la mozione con fare costruttivo, pensandola già da tanto. Sappiamo che la madre di tutte le battaglie è quella volta a evitare che si ripeta una situazione di gravità ed emergenza sanitaria come quella che abbiamo vissuto nei mesi scorsi. Questa è la madre di tutte le battaglie; non vi è battaglia più importante perché le altre da essa discendono. Se potenziamo l'economia, ma la gente torna ad avere paura di prendere il virus, allora la ripresa economica del nostro Paese diventa un problema. Le fasi dello screening, del monitoraggio, del potenziamento della medicina territoriale e della diagnostica diventano fondamentali. L'intervento deve essere fatto in maniera massiccia, non con la app Immuni, né con 150.000 test. Devono essere fatti 10 milioni di test, così come avviene in Germania. Non ci inventiamo nulla; si tratta di un qualcosa che qualcuno sta già facendo. È in questa direzione che abbiamo presentato la mozione, con spirito costruttivo e senza alcuna volontà di mettere bandierine. Penso che tutto il Senato debba essere d'accordo con queste posizioni, perché - ripeto - sono quelle che possono garantire un futuro migliore ai nostri cittadini.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.55995774269104, 0.44004228711128235]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, con l'interrogazione in esame il senatore Castaldi - che peraltro incontro in Commissione industria della quale è uno dei membri più attivi - chiede al Governo di conoscere quali iniziative si intendano intraprendere, in materia di responsabilità civile auto, per promuovere misure di sorveglianza efficaci al fine di evitare strategie di cartello tra le imprese assicuratrici a danno dei consumatori, in modo da adottare anche disposizioni che consentano di garantire premi più bassi per gli assicurati, maggiore trasparenza ed una maggiore concorrenzialità nel settore. <p> Preliminarmente, il senatore Castaldi richiama l'attività istruttoria avviata dall'Autorità garante della concorrenza e del mercato anche a seguito di alcune dichiarazioni da parte dei gruppi Generali ed Unipol, con le quali si paventava il rischio di una attenuazione delle dinamiche concorrenziali sui prezzi RC auto con previsioni di rialzo dei prezzi delle polizze, dopo una lunga fase di discesa dell'ultimo periodo. Gli onorevoli interroganti ricordano, inoltre, le conclusioni di un'indagine conoscitiva chiusa nel 2013 dall'Autorità antitrust, che ha evidenziato una serie di potenziali ostacoli alla concorrenza e proposto diverse misure pro-concorrenziali. La stessa Autorità è più volte intervenuta su tali realtà stimolando una concreta concorrenza a vantaggio dei consumatori, non da ultimo, come noto, tramite un intervento del presidente, professor Giovanni Pitruzzella, dell'ottobre 2015, nell'occasione di un'audizione presso la 10ᵃ Commissione permanente del Senato sul disegno di legge concorrenza. Tale disegno di legge, in procinto - speriamo - di essere votato in Aula nelle prossime settimane per passare - in seconda lettura degli articoli novellati - alla definitiva approvazione alla Camera, come riconosciuto dagli stessi onorevoli interroganti, contiene disposizioni atte a garantire la trasparenza del mercato a vantaggio dei consumatori, con particolare riguardo agli automobilisti virtuosi, riducendo gli squilibri territoriali attualmente esistenti. Quanto ai quesiti posti, nel merito dell'interrogazione in oggetto, va evidenziato come l'atto medesimo proponga, tra le misure relative al settore assicurativo (articoli 2-15), una serie di interventi volti a promuovere la concorrenza e favorire la trasparenza e la conoscibilità delle azioni di mercato a vantaggio dei consumatori, includendo un confronto competitivo reale tra i principali players del settore. In particolare, è prevista la predisposizione di un articolato sistema di sconti di maggior beneficio per gli assicurati virtuosi delle Province a più alto tasso di sinistrosità e con premio medio più elevato per coloro i quali sottopongano il veicolo a ispezione preventiva e che accettino di installare sul proprio veicolo la cosiddetta black box, sulla base di criteri e modalità di determinazione regolati e monitorati dall'Istituto per la vigilanza sulle assicurazioni (IVASS). La riforma della RC auto reca una serie di ulteriori interventi in favore dei consumatori e degli assicurati virtuosi, con riferimento all'assegnazione delle classi di merito, con divieto di discriminare in funzione della durata del rapporto, atti a garantire, nell'ambito della classe di appartenenza, le condizioni di merito assegnate agli assicurati aventi le stesse caratteristiche di rischio del soggetto che stipula il nuovo contratto. Sono altresì contemplate norme di maggiore vantaggio nelle variazioni peggiorative di premio (quindi anche di classe di merito) per coloro i quali hanno installato le cosiddette scatole nere sulla vettura, rispetto a quelli altrimenti applicati, ovvero attraverso la previsione di sconti per coloro i quali sottopongano il veicolo a ispezione preventiva o, ancora, installino sulla vettura meccanismi elettronici che impediscono l'avvio del motore qualora sia riscontrato un elevato tasso alcolemico. In particolare, l'ulteriore sconto a cui si è in precedenza fatto riferimento, caratterizzato per una maggiore consistenza ed incisività rispetto a quello altresì applicato già in occasione della sottoscrizione delle citate clausole contrattuali offerte dall'impresa, avrà come finalità la valorizzazione (naturalmente economica) proprio di quei comportamenti virtuosi tenuti dagli automobilisti e volti a contrastare la diffusione delle frodi alle assicurazioni. Tali misure sono finalizzate proprio ad attenuare il peso specifico della territorialità nella determinazione dei premi di assicurazione. Concludo con l'auspicio che il Parlamento possa approvare in tempi rapidi le descritte norme, così da giungere alla conclusione di tale percorso per far fronte sia alle esigenze dei consumatori, sia agli impegni assunti con l'Unione europea.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5282946228981018, 0.47170543670654297]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> BERTUZZI (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, quando un sindaco e i suoi amministratori sentono dire che finalmente il Governo ha stanziato fondi per le periferie attraverso un bando, sicuramente sono felici.

Non entro nel merito se siano fattibili o meno (non è compito nostro giudicarli, per quello ci sono i tecnici), però credo che una riflessione su come vengono spesi i soldi dei cittadini sia quantomeno doverosa.

Sì, perché anche l'Europa oggi parla di manovre espansive. <p> Oggi parlare di un deficit previsto al 2,2 per cento non è più uno scandalo: è una brillante intuizione. Ma mi chiedo: come mai lo scorso anno ci si arrampicava sull'1,6 per cento richiesto dalla Commissione europea, per poi ottenere il via libera a un 2,04? <p> Perché l'altro anno il clima, durante le audizioni, era così ostile alle nostre ricette di assoluto buon senso?

Nel 2019 i primi effetti della nostra manovra hanno cominciato a farsi sentire: altro che, come dice il Ministro, acciuffare l'Italia per i capelli! Le stime di finanza pubblica nell'assestamento di luglio hanno dato evidenza di un miglioramento dei saldi rispetto alle previsioni contenute nel DEF 2019 e un deficit nominale in linea col target fissato dalla legge di bilancio 2019, pur in una condizione macroeconomica peggiore rispetto a quella prevista a dicembre 2018.

Si parla altresì di green new deal; ottimo, salviamo l'ambiente, ma dietro ai roboanti annunci si nasconde il taglio dei sussidi ambientalmente dannosi (non si sa quali né come) e questo è un terreno pericolosissimo per l'economia italiana e soprattutto per i nostri agricoltori. Tutte queste belle cose le volete finanziare, tra l'altro, con 7 miliardi di recupero dalla lotta all'evasione fiscale, da attuare con la restrizione all'uso del contante e agevolando l'uso delle carte di credito.

Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori e senatrici, ieri a Milano la terza donna sfigurata dall'acido. Ilaria, Alessandra, Chiara sono solo le ultime vittime di femminicidio delle ultime ore, dopo Denise, Michela e Lucia. Una catena di violenze e di morte che ha colpito 24 donne solo nei primi quattro mesi di quest'anno e 124 nel 2012. È una triste catena che va spezzata al più presto. In più della metà dei casi il femminicidio è stato commesso dal partner nell'ambito di una relazione in corso o appena terminata, che sia coniuge, convivente, fidanzato o ex. Gli autori di femminicidio sono per il 79 per cento uomini italiani, e solo una minima parte di questi delitti è avvenuta per mano di sconosciuti. Questo ci dicono i dati del «Rapporto Ombra» della società civile sulla condizione delle donne in Italia. I media spesso presentano i casi di femminicidio come frutto di delitti passionali, di un'azione improvvisa ed imprevedibile di uomini vittime di raptus e follia omicida. In realtà sono l'epilogo di un crescendo di violenza a senso unico, causati dall'incapacità di accettare le separazioni, dalle gelosie, da un sentimento di orgoglio ferito, dalla volontà di vendetta e punizione nei confronti di una donna che ha trasgredito ad un modello di comportamento tradizionale. Un ruolo che in Italia è ancora relegato a quello di madre e di moglie, oppure di oggetto di desiderio sessuale. Bene ha fatto la neoministra Josefa Idem a convocare subito un tavolo interistituzionale con i Ministeri della giustizia e dell'interno e bene ha fatto la presidente Boldrini a lanciare l'allarme perché non venga sottovalutata alcun tipo di violenza, neppure quella via web, di cui la stessa presidente della Camera è stata vittima e a cui esprimiamo tutta la nostra solidarietà. Ma quest'Aula e questo Parlamento, finalmente con una maggiore rappresentanza femminile, hanno il dovere di agire subito per l'approvazione di una legge nazionale contro il femminicidio e di lavorare con le tante associazioni di donne, con i centri antiviolenza, che vanno rifinanziati, con le giuriste e con le amministratrici locali per affrontare in modo risoluto questa vera e propria emergenza nazionale. Possiamo farlo tutti assieme, in modo trasversale, come noi donne sappiamo fare in questi casi, come le donne hanno già saputo fare per l'approvazione della legge sullo stalking del 2009.

Signora Presidente, signor Sottosegretario, colleghi senatrici e senatori, sono di alcuni giorni fa - del 5 maggio - le stime della Commissione europea che prevedono una ripresa - seppure in termini di decimali - per la zona europea e per il nostro Paese in ordine al <PARTY>L, all'occupazione e all'inflazione. Sappiamo bene, però, che dietro alle cifre e alle medie si celano talvolta delle grandi differenze e vi sono, ad esempio sul <PARTY>L e sull'occupazione, delle differenze non solo in Europa, ma anche, ovviamente, nel nostro stesso Paese. La media tende infatti, per sua natura, ad essere bugiarda e a celare queste differenze. Se ci deve essere - come ci deve essere - una crescita stabile e duratura, per essere tale, essa non può essere a macchia di leopardo. Deve essere una crescita organica: non ci possono essere zone a bassa crescita, come è il nostro Mezzogiorno, ad esempio, e zone a crescita più elevata, come il Nord del nostro Paese. Quindi, è necessario che la politica si assuma la responsabilità di avere una visione globale, realizzando interventi a sostegno di una crescita omogenea, che è a sua volta un moltiplicatore: consente di aumentare la crescita, si autoalimenta. Ci troviamo quindi di fronte a questa realtà, quella sarda, che vede un'isola, una Regione con tutti gli indici, come è stato elencato da chi mi ha preceduto e come è contenuto nelle stesse mozioni, altamente differenziati rispetto alla media nazionale. È una Regione con debolezze strutturali, che in questo dibattito sono state tutte ampiamente elencate. Abbiamo una serie di problemi: dai costi dell'energia a quelli dei trasporti interni; dalle grandi difficoltà dei trasporti marittimi e aerei di collegamento tra l'Italia e la Sardegna alle servitù militari; dalla crisi di aree industriali ai problemi del ridimensionamento di alcuni servizi dello Stato, come la giustizia, per esempio, la scuola; alla caduta - direi libera - del settore agroindustriale. Mi sono meravigliato che nelle mozioni che sono state presentate sia stato dato uno spazio ridotto - addirittura in alcune non è stato neppure accennato - al grande tema del turismo. Un turismo che è stato ridotto ai minimi termini in Sardegna, che invece dovrebbe essere la patria del turismo, per scelte demagogiche che sono state in quest'Aula segnalate dal senatore Consiglio, anche se il turismo non riesce mai da solo - e questo vale per l'Italia, per la Francia, per la Sardegna e per qualsiasi Nazione o area al mondo - a sopperire alla perdita della capacità industriale dei servizi di produrre ricchezza e benessere. Il turismo non è sufficiente da solo; occorre però rafforzare questa peculiarità e per farlo occorre ovviamente - è lapalissiano - rafforzare le infrastrutture, i servizi, i trasporti della Sardegna. Infine, vorrei sottolineare un ultimo punto. Leggendo le mozioni si ha chiaro che lo spirito che le muove è sardo: sono scritte e compartecipate da senatori della Sardegna (e non può che essere così), che vivono da vicino il disagio della crisi economica, il disagio di questa meravigliosa terra, forse una delle più belle del mondo. Eppure, in tutto questo c'è sempre e solo un'indicazione: la responsabilità dello Stato centrale per l'arretratezza economica di quest'isola. Io penso che lo Stato centrale, come ricordava il senatore Carraro, ha molte responsabilità, ma non tutte. Vi chiedo se è possibile che tutto avvenga sempre e solo per colpa dello Stato centrale. Certamente è così nel caso, per esempio, delle alluvioni o nel caso di alcuni provvedimenti che dovevano essere fatti, anche sul fisco, e non sono stati fatti, ma è possibile che non vi sia anche una corresponsabilità della classe politica che ha governato o «sgovernato» questa Regione in tutti questi anni? Una classe dirigente locale che non ha fatto il possibile per rendere forti le eccellenze di quest'isola, attaccandosi invece soltanto a politiche assistenziali e inefficienti? La crisi economica non si alimenta forse anche del proliferare di interventi e di logiche, appunto, assistenziali? E non sarebbe stato invece più proficuo aiutare l'imprenditorialità locale, la microimprenditorialità e le piccole e medie imprese perché potessero diventare medie e grandi imprese? Io credo che le mozioni rechino la richiesta di una serie di impegni verso il Governo che, se mi è consentito dirlo, sono un po' troppo numerosi. Li trovo quindi riduttivi o generici, se non quello, che invece mi pare più produttivo di tutti gli altri, che impegna il Governo a fare della Sardegna una questione nazionale, come ricordava la mozione presentata dal senatore Uras, e conseguentemente a dare corpo all'istituzione di un comitato di coordinamento tra Governo nazionale e governo regionale nel più breve tempo possibile, e questo non è indicato nelle mozioni, perché la variabile tempo è fondamentale per agevolare oppure per allontanare le visioni virtuose in ordine alla crescita, al lavoro e all'occupazione. Sono quindi valide le premesse di queste mozioni, dispersive invece negli impegni che sarebbe stato meglio concentrare in un unico impegno: quello, appunto, di fare della Sardegna la questione nazionale.

Una manovra tattica che evidenzia l'incapacità di Palazzo Chigi di pianificare una efficiente strategia politica per il Paese; un provvedimento le cui assurdità sono molteplici: il necessario prolungamento della Naspi affinché i lavoratori in disoccupazione involontaria non perdano il loro giusto sussidio causato dalla mancanza di una riforma del welfare; l'incomprensibile reiterazione della nomina, con un compenso di 100.000 euro, del commissario ad acta per il terremoto dell'Irpinia del lontano 1980; l'incredibile rinvio per la dodicesima volta del termine per attribuire ai prefetti il compito di sollecitare i Comuni nell'approvazione dei bilanci di previsione; lo strumentale prolungamento dei contratti dei dipendenti a tempo determinato delle Province per rinviare la soluzione dell'annoso problema del contrasto tra il referendum e la legge Delrio. Tra i punti più critici di questo decreto, però, vi è la proroga dell'applicazione della direttiva Bolkestein al 2018, una decisione scellerata dettata soprattutto da una promessa fatta dall'ex Premier a fini elettoralistici. Sul tema tanto è stato fatto, dal decreto attuativo del 2010 all'intesa in Conferenza unificata del 2012, peraltro legittimata - lo sottolineo - anche dalla Corte costituzionale, al fine di garantire una adeguata programmazione dei lavori delle parti coinvolte. Su questa base molte Regioni e centinaia di Comuni a dicembre scorso avevano iniziato le procedure di selezione e aperto la fase di presentazione delle domande per l'assegnazione delle nuove concessioni. Ma ora tutto è sospeso in un limbo giuridico. Cosa dovrebbero fare Comuni e imprese? Il Governo ha creato una totale confusione interpretativa e così le amministrazioni hanno risposto in maniera disorganica: alcuni Comuni hanno sospeso i bandi mentre altri hanno deciso di continuare comunque le procedure e altri ancora non sanno come comportarsi. Questo disordine normativo non ha fatto che alimentare tensioni e caos sfociati anche nella manifestazione di ieri, in cui una squadriglia di ambulanti, non aderenti ad alcuna organizzazione nazionale di categoria, ha tenuto in ostaggio una strada, ha bloccato i lavori sul provvedimento e, come se non bastasse, è stata ricevuta in Senato. Atteggiamento a dir poco censurabile, perché crea un pericoloso precedente e perché si dà l'idea che in questo Paese ottiene di più chi ricorre alla forza e al disordine rispetto a chi si muove all'interno della legalità. Al contrario, invece, va apprezzato l'equilibrio adottato dalle associazioni imprenditoriali di Confcommercio e Confesercenti che, con una dialettica costruttiva, hanno portato avanti le proprie giuste istanze al fine di salvaguardare i loro associati, piccole imprese familiari il cui futuro economico è connesso alla loro attività. A seguito della protesta di piazza di ieri, la Commissione ha dovuto trovare la quadra con una soluzione salomonica, approvando un emendamento che propone la proroga delle concessioni al 31 dicembre 2018, pur consentendo ai Comuni di far partire i bandi anche prima di tale data. Insomma, un patto al ribasso per quelle migliaia di imprese che, stante la nuova normativa, avevano già avviato gli adempimenti di loro spettanza sostenendone anche i relativi costi. Diciamolo con franchezza: la Bolkestein è una direttiva folle, ma palazzo Chigi non ha la forza di contrastarla e si piega nuovamente a Bruxelles pur di non acuire le già pesanti tensioni con l'Europa. Anche in questo caso, la ragion di Stato non si concilia con le ragioni del Paese che produce, ma si sa: questo Governo antepone sempre i giochi di palazzo agli interessi degli italiani.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.559906005859375, 0.4400940239429474]}, {'sequence': 'Signor Presidente, ho conosciuto il senatore Caridi nel 1997, quando aveva circa 28 anni ed era stato appena eletto consigliere comunale, perché ero andato a Reggio Calabria a presentare il mio libro «Storie di straordinaria ingiustizia». Avevo scelto Reggio Calabria perché l\\'ex sindaco Pierino Battaglia e l\\'ex deputato Quattrone si erano fatti mesi o anni di carcere, accusati di essere i mandanti dell\\'assassino del presidente delle ferrovie Ligato, e poi erano stati assolti con formula piena. Era uno dei tanti casi di storia di straordinaria ingiustizia e mi ritrovai in una sala affollatissima perché Quattrone e Battaglia, specialmente quest\\'ultimo, erano considerati dall\\'opinione pubblica come persone integerrime. Avevano subito questo calvario giudiziario incredibile e l\\'onta del carcere per mesi o anni e poi erano stati assolti con formula piena. Ho il ricordo di questa vicenda e di questo giovane consigliere comunale. <p> Poi, Presidente, ho anche il ricordo di Aule parlamentari e di vicende parlamentari, come per esempio quella in cui i girondini furono consegnati dalla Convenzione nazionale ai carnefici e venne tagliata a tutti loro la testa perché, com\\'è noto, quell\\'Assemblea decise a maggioranza di consegnarli al patibolo in quanto avevano divergenze politiche con la maggioranza giacobina. Posso ricordare, sempre nell\\'utilizzo dei Regolamenti parlamentari, che i fascisti fecero decadere gli aventiniani da deputati utilizzando uno strumento regolamentare: non partecipavano all\\'Assemblea e quindi vennero dichiarati decaduti. Questo per dire che nella storia parlamentare ci sono episodi vergognosi che poi la storia ha riconosciuto come tali e che rischiamo di reiterare oggi in questa Aula. <p> Non ho ancora sentito nessuno, salvo il Presidente della Giunta, spiegarmi quale sia l\\'episodio singolo e specifico nel quale il senatore Caridi avrebbe favorito, come esecutore, la mafia. Vedo nelle tribune la giornalista Milella, di «la Repubblica», ma non solo lei, tutti i giornali, questa mattina, hanno continuato a scrivere la vecchia versione, cioè che il senatore Caridi è il capo della cupola dei mammasantissima: è sfuggito loro che quest\\'accusa è totalmente caduta. Oggi non viene chiesto l\\'arresto di Caridi perché è il capo di qualcosa, ma perché sarebbe un semplice esecutore; non dico un manovale della \\'ndrangheta, ma avrebbe un ruolo, utilizzato quando era consigliere comunale o provinciale o senatore, per curare questi interessi. <p> Dice il relatore, con una frase che ripeterò e su cui scriverò un libro, che non è «implausibile» che questo sia avvenuto. Ora, l\\'espressione «non è implausibile» vuol dire che non è da escludersi, ma ci hanno spiegato che lui deve andare in carcere senza che valga il problema del pericolo di fuga, dell\\'inquinamento delle prove o della reiterazione del reato, ma perché, essendo un reato mafioso, il carcere scatta automaticamente se ci sono prove o gravi indizi. Io di prove non ne ho viste. <p> Qual è l\\'atto specifico che lui avrebbe commesso per favorire la \\'ndrangheta o la mafia? Sì, agli atti c\\'è l\\'assunzione di cinque operatori ecologici - spazzini, parliamoci chiaro - a tempo determinato. Quindi, nei suoi quindici anni di assessorato e quant\\'altro, sarebbe colpevole di avere assunto cinque persone, immagino in concorso con tutti i politici calabresi, siciliani, pugliesi o campani, perché quando hanno fatto gli assessori, sarà capitato anche a loro di assumere nelle aziende delle persone incensurate, che nulla hanno a che fare con la mafia. Questa sarebbe l\\'indicazione. E poi vi sono due o tre intercettazioni che - ahimè - sono state totalmente smentite dai fatti. <p> Ma si dice - e, colleghi, richiamo tutti a questo principio - che lui era amico di Francesco Chirico. Francesco Chirico militava nel suo partito, era una persona incensurata, ma lo ha aiutato, quando venne eletto consigliere comunale, a raccogliere i voti. Dov\\'è il problema, se una persona incensurata, un dipendente comunale, lo ha aiutato a raccogliere i voti? Con questa persona poi si sono rotti i rapporti, come dimostrato dalle carte, perché, pensando il Chirico di poter poi essere favorito dal Caridi, quando quest\\'ultimo non l\\'ha promosso, è diventato un suo acerrimo nemico. <p> Poi si sostiene: è vero che Francesco Chirico è incensurato, ma ha delle parentele con una famiglia mafiosa. È un problema di cui ho parlato mille volte in quest\\'Aula e che vale per il Sud, per Modena, come per la Lombardia: che deve fare una persona onesta se nelle Regioni ad alta densità mafiosa ha affinità o parentele con persone disoneste? Non deve più andare a lavorare? Non deve più svolgere un\\'attività professionale? Dev\\'essere colpito da interdittive antimafia perché un suo fratello ha sposato una donna che è figlia di qualcuno \"che fa parte di\"? Quello della responsabilità civile, amministrativa e penale personale che è cosa diversa dal sentito dire o dalle parentele è un problema che ho posto mille volte. Ma qui viene addebitato al Caridi di aver avuto l\\'appoggio elettorale di una persona onesta e incensurata perché questa ha delle parentele. <p> Vogliamo parlare dell\\'altra prova regina del senatore e sottosegretario Valentino e di un tale Romeo che era, al tempo, incensurato e che due anni fa è stato ricevuto qui in Senato, dopo la condanna, in Commissione affari costituzionali (non Caridi, Romeo è stato accolto qui al Senato ed ha partecipato)? Se qualcuno avesse la pazienza di leggere le dieci pagine in cui il senatore Valentino e Romeo e Caridi parlano della sua candidatura, troverebbe una delle più belle pagine di trasparenza e di onestà che ho mai visto. Perché questi parlano soltanto dello sviluppo della Calabria e di idee innovative. Valentino ricorda che lui viene dalla destra quindi non ha cultura di Governo, mentre... (Il Presidente interloquisce con il senatore Segretario Scoma). Io vorrei parlare al Presidente, scusate. Ribadisco che vorrei parlare al Presidente. Visto che mi devo rivolgere al Presidente, vorrei che il Presidente mi ascoltasse. PRESIDENTE. Anche all\\'Assemblea. GIOVANARDI (<PARTY> (GS, PpI, M, Id, ApI, E-E, MPL)). Sì, all\\'Assemblea, ma devo rivolgermi al Presidente e poi all\\'Aula, ma mi hanno richiamato tante volte per il fatto che devo rivolgermi al Presidente. Dicevo, è una delle più belle pagine di trasparenza, perché Valentino ricorda che viene dalla destra, che non ha cultura di Governo, e il Caridi invece viene da una famiglia democristiana, che il papà era recordman di preferenze, come lo zio, Bruno Porcino, medico stimato e quant\\'altro. Alla fine di tutta questa conversazione, il sottosegretario alla giustizia Valentino, che attualmente è uno dei più stimati avvocati italiani, mai raggiunto da alcun sospetto, dice: Caridi, una volta eletto - lui voleva fare il sindaco o il vicesindaco - ricordati che a noi devi pagare una cambiale! E giù risate da parte di tutti. Bene, la cambiale è la prova regina della sua affiliazione e partecipazione al vertice della cupola. Quando si legge una cosa così viene da pensare che chiunque dei colleghi può essere trascinato in una vicenda giudiziaria infame da qualcuno che veramente prende lucciole per lanterne. O forse non ha mai partecipato e non sa che, quando il Capo dello Stato si occupa della formazione del nuovo Governo e della nomina dei Ministri, compie una disamina delle caratteristiche di ogni persona, dicendo «questo sì», «quello no». Oppure penso alla formazione di una Giunta comunale: se il sindaco è di un partito, il vice sindaco sarà di un altro partito, perché - si chiama democrazia - bisogna tener conto dei rapporti di forza, soprattutto tra partiti. Se questa è malavita. C\\'è poi la cambiale di cui ha parlato Valentino, che sarebbe la prova. Quella è la prova principale e l\\'incontro con la persona che stava in galera è l\\'altra prova che viene portata. Per le circostanze che gli vengono addebitate, non c\\'è altra prova che questa, cioè il fatto che egli sarebbe chiacchierato a Reggio Calabria, non certo a Cuneo, per avere frequentazioni o conoscenze in una realtà dove le cosche, purtroppo, esistono. Vorrei sapere chi si può difendere da accuse generiche di questo tipo. Giustamente è stato detto che c\\'è un processo e, in quell\\'ambito, egli farà valere le sue ragioni e l\\'accusa tenterà di dimostrare le proprie. Ricordo - l\\'ho scritto nel libro - che, al tempo, il 90 per cento dei miei 90 colleghi incriminati è stato assolto. Il reato non si è prescritto, ma si è trattato di assoluzione o archiviazione perché il reato addebitato non esisteva. Parlo di parlamentari e degli anni 1992-1994. Ripeto: ciò è avvenuto 90 volte su 100. Qui c\\'è una richiesta di mandare il senatore Caridi in galera, farlo incarcerare, fargli perdere la libertà personale, distruggergli la tranquillità familiare e dare un\\'immagine dei colleghi che ritengono credibile che egli sia un criminale. In questi tre anni - è noto a tutti, no? - egli ha condizionato i lavori del Parlamento. È evidente: sappiamo tutti che il senatore Caridi era l\\'uomo nero che ha determinato l\\'indirizzo del Senato in questi anni, o no? Come senatore sicuramente non l\\'ha fatto. Inoltre, è stato detto e dimostrato in Giunta che stiamo parlando di cose avvenute negli ultimi diciotto anni: le prime intercettazioni risalgono agli anni 1997-1998 e, poi, ci sono quelle del 2002. Ci sono atti che sono stati vagliati in tantissimi processi, nell\\'ambito dei quali sono state giustamente condannate altre persone, compresi i suoi concorrenti. Caridi non è stato eletto alle elezioni regionali e i voti delle famiglie sono stati insufficienti per lui, ma non per altri candidati che nei processi sono emersi come beneficiari. Se la cosca di San Luca (mi pare il clan Pelle) lo ha appoggiato, come spiegare che in quel paese egli ha ottenuto 22 voti, mentre il primo ne ha presi 120 e, a seguire, gli altri? Ripeto: come si fa a dire che Caridi ha ottenuto l\\'appoggio della \\'ndrangheta di San Luca se in quel paese ha ottenuto 22 voti e gli altri 120? È quanto ho chiesto in Giunta. In Giunta, nella difesa che ha dovuto raffazzonare in pochi giorni e che ha illustrato ieri mattina, Caridi ha fornito tutte le tabelline elettorali e spiegato per filo e per segno le cose. Se ha detto cose false è giusto che vada in carcere, ma se ha detto cose vere perché la Giunta non ha verificato - poteva farlo - la veridicità delle sue affermazioni? Perché dobbiamo votare se mandarlo in carcere oppure no se, in un\\'istruttoria che è durata poche ore e con tre interruzioni (dovevamo infatti essere presenti in Aula per le votazioni), nessuno è stato in grado di leggere le ultime 1.500 pagine, né di valutare con attenzione quello che egli ha detto? Se quello che ha detto è vero, perché deve andare in carcere? Ma perché deve perdere la libertà personale, tra le altre cose visto che il 13 agosto il tribunale per il riesame deve decidere? Colleghi, con il voto segreto ci si deve guardare dentro e pensare che questa è una cosa che può capitare a tutti. <p> Sì, accuse di questo genere possono capitare a tutti, perché quando sono costruite sul nulla può succedere a tutti di trovarsi in questa situazione. Ci si assume la responsabilità di mandare in carcerare sulla base non di un qualche elemento concreto, ma di supposizioni. <p> Signor Presidente - lo diremo anche in dichiarazione di voto - mancano proprio gli elementi minimi per togliere la libertà personale a un parlamentare e per modificare degli assetti. Lo ha detto il collega Malan, seppure, chiaramente, in maniera paradossale: se non ci fosse stato il senatore Caridi con il suo voto, sarebbe cambiata la storia del Parlamento italiano e del Governo, sarebbe mancato quel voto determinante e ci sarebbero stati altri indirizzi politici. Certo, lo ha detto come paradosso, ma abbiamo visto che anche la mancanza o la presenza di un parlamentare può essere determinante: si veda la caduta di Berlusconi, a suo tempo, quando non fu approvato un documento di bilancio, dal momento che la relativa votazione finì in pareggio. In quel caso ci fu la mancanza di un deputato, per il quale la Camera dei deputati aveva concesso l\\'arresto, che dunque stava in carcere, e che poi è stato assolto. Quindi, la sua mancanza fisica ha determinato un indirizzo e un orientamento diverso della vita politica italiana. Mandare in carcere un parlamentare, al di là dei suoi problemi personali, è una lesione gravissima della composizione del Senato e se viene deciso sulla base delle non indicazioni che abbiamo avuto in questi giorni, credo che sarebbe davvero una giornata tristissima per il Parlamento e le istituzioni.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5179363489151001, 0.4820636212825775]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, intervengo per dire alcune cose che hanno una rilevanza più tattica, che strategica, ma che possiedono la loro importanza. <p> Per quanto riguarda il reddito di cittadinanza, penso sia impensabile consegnare ai centri per l'impiego il controllo di una legge di questo tipo, perché essi esistono solo sulla carta; il meccanismo funziona in tal modo fin dai tempi del vecchio ufficio di collocamento. <p> L'impresa assume, cioè, dei lavoratori e dà poi il loro nome e cognome al centro per l'impiego, il quale ha compiti soltanto notarili e, quindi, non può sicuramente controllare una legge così importante e costosa. Non bisogna scherzare. Prima di fare il reddito di cittadinanza, va fatto lo strumento di controllo, altrimenti ci troveremo in una situazione molto negativa. <p> Un altro punto importante concerne le pensioni. Come sappiamo, la cosiddetta legge Fornero ha colpito due tipi di pensioni: le pensioni di anzianità, togliendo le quote alle quali esse erano legate, e le pensioni di vecchiaia, date ai cittadini che non hanno lavorato abbastanza, e cioè dato contributi all'INPS per almeno trentacinque anni. La legge Fornero ha sancito che si raggiunge la pensione di vecchiaia a sessantasei anni e sette mesi. <p> Ora se si vuole davvero cambiare siffatta idea, bisogna ricordare che la cosiddetta legge Tremonti, fatta allo scopo di salvaguardare le casse dell'INPS, prevede - per fortuna - che ogni anno l'aumento dell'età per la pensione di vecchiaia sia collegato all'aspettativa di vita stabilita dall'ISTAT; vanno quindi fermati gli effetti automatici della legge Tremonti sulla pensione di vecchiaia. Non sarebbe la prima perché già si è fatto, ma è una cosa da fare subito, una delle prime cose da fare, altrimenti tutti parlano di riforme che non sarebbero però assolutamente possibili.

Il ruolo della Commissione parlamentare per l'indirizzo generale e la vigilanza dei servizi radiotelevisivi, istituita allo scopo di garantire, attraverso il controllo parlamentare, il principio del pluralismo dell'informazione, viene ricondotto a tale missione originaria. <p> Signor Presidente, mi scusi, ma con questo brusio non riesco nemmeno a parlare. <p> RANUCCI, relatore. Come dicevo, il principio del pluralismo dell'informazione viene ricondotto a tale missione originaria, eliminando per contro compiti interferenti con la gestione della società e della sua governance. Quanto detto, nel pieno rispetto, ed anzi in coerenza e in attuazione del quadro costituzionale come delineato, in particolare, dalla giurisprudenza della Corte, a partire dalla sentenza n. 225 del 1974. Non a caso, sono stati trasfusi in norma i principi relativi alla revoca dei membri del consiglio di amministrazione, condizionandone l'efficacia al vaglio della menzionata Commissione parlamentare. Risulta, altresì, salvaguardato il principio secondo cui gli organi direttivi dell'ente gestore non sono costituiti in modo da rappresentare direttamente o indirettamente l'espressione, esclusiva o preponderante, del potere esecutivo e che la loro struttura è tale da garantirne l'obiettività. In questo senso il disegno di legge prevede la nomina da parte del Governo di due soli membri. Inoltre, la norma intende garantire, anche attraverso la partecipazione dei dipendenti alla nomina dell'organo amministrativo, che le linee editoriali siano ispirate a criteri di imparzialità e pluralismo. Su un testo che io ritengo già buono, la Commissione ha svolto un lavoro molto attento. Per questo devo ringraziare tutti i componenti della Commissione, di maggioranza e opposizione, che hanno ulteriormente contribuito a migliorarlo. Per quanto riguarda l'articolo 1 del disegno di legge in esame, che novella l'articolo 45 del testo unico dei servizi di media audiovisivi e radiofonici in relazione alla disciplina dei contratti per lo svolgimento del servizio pubblico, prevedendone tra l'altro il prolungamento della durata da tre a cinque anni, le principali modifiche apportate nel corso dell'esame in 8ᵃ Commissione riguardano l'inserimento del richiamo alla concessione che riconosce alla RAI il ruolo del gestore del servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo nazionale e, con particolare riguardo alle disposizioni sulle sedi che svolgono il servizio pubblico nei territori ove sono presenti minoranze linguistiche, l'individuazione di una soluzione per la questione della convenzione radiotelevisiva tra la Provincia autonoma di Bolzano e la RAI, soluzione che definisce anche gli aspetti di carattere finanziario. In relazione poi all'articolo 2 del testo, che interviene sull'articolo 49 del testo unico per delineare il nuovo assetto della governance della RAI, l'8ᵃ Commissione ha innanzitutto integrato i requisiti richiesti per la nomina a membro del consiglio di amministrazione, specificando che essa debba essere effettuata in modo tale da assicurare la parità di genere, l'equilibrio tra le professionalità e le esperienze dei componenti, l'assenza di conflitti di interesse e di cumulo di cariche in società concorrenti. I membri del consiglio di amministrazione dovranno essere inoltre scelti tra persone di riconosciuta onorabilità. Rispetto al testo presentato, è stata poi reintrodotta la previsione che la nomina del presidente del consiglio di amministrazione divenga efficace dopo l'acquisizione del parere favorevole, espresso a maggioranza dei due terzi, della Commissione parlamentare di vigilanza sui servizi radiotelevisivi. Al presidente, inoltre, possono essere affidate dal consiglio di amministrazione deleghe nelle aree delle relazioni esterne e istituzionali e di supervisione delle attività di controllo interno, previa delibera assembleare che ne autorizzi la delega. L'8ᵃ Commissione è poi intervenuta per specificare che la designazione dei membri da parte del Consiglio dei ministri, su proposta del Ministro dell'economia, deve avvenire in conformità ai criteri e alle modalità di nomina dei componenti degli organi di amministrazione delle società controllate direttamente o indirettamente dal Ministero dell'economia e delle finanze, di cui alla direttiva del Ministro dell'economia e delle finanze del 24 giugno 2013, e che il membro del consiglio designato dall'assemblea dei dipendenti della RAI deve avere il requisito di almeno tre anni consecutivi di lavoro dipendente presso tale società. Si è poi intervenuti sulle modalità per la selezione dei componenti di designazione parlamentare, introducendo procedure trasparenti, che prevedono la pubblicazione su Internet sia degli avvisi di selezione che dei curricula dei partecipanti, nonché sulle procedure per l'elezione del componente espresso dall'assemblea dei dipendenti della RAI, in modo da garantire la partecipazione e la segretezza del voto. Quanto alla revoca dei membri del consiglio, si stabilisce che essa acquisti efficacia se conforme alla deliberazione della Commissione parlamentare di vigilanza sulla RAI. Un'ulteriore integrazione approvata dalla 8ᵃ Commissione dispone che il presidente del consiglio di amministrazione e due consiglieri, individuati dal consiglio stesso, svolgano funzioni di controllo e di sorveglianza sull'attuazione da parte dell'azienda delle linee e degli indirizzi programmatici, sullo sviluppo e sulla commercializzazione del prodotto audiovisivo, sullo sviluppo del portale e sulla fruizione dei relativi contenuti attraverso nuovi dispositivi e piattaforme e sulla qualità della programmazione del servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo, con un rapporto semestrale sull'attività svolta. Vorrei aprire una piccola parentesi e ricordare che attualmente il consiglio di amministrazione della RAI viene convocato, a volte, ogni quindici giorni, essendovi una necessità, perché non c'è nessuno che possa prendere le decisioni. C'è, quindi, la necessità che sia il consiglio a prendere le decisioni. In questo nuovo assetto, il consiglio di amministrazione sarà convocato le volte che saranno necessarie, come tutti gli altri consigli di amministrazione (quattro o cinque volte l'anno), ma al suo interno vi saranno dei comitati come in tutti i consigli di amministrazione delle società partecipate o delle società per azioni che abbiano dei compiti. Abbiamo voluto segnalare che, considerata la delicatezza del servizio pubblico, all'interno del consiglio di amministrazione il presidente e due consiglieri si occuperanno esclusivamente di segnalare al consiglio l'andamento dell'attività culturale e del servizio pubblico. Per quanto riguarda poi l'amministratore delegato, la 8ᵃ Commissione ha integrato il testo in esame con riferimento sia ai poteri che ai requisiti richiesti per ricoprire tale incarico. La modifica più rilevante in relazione ai poteri dell'amministratore delegato riguarda la nomina dei dirigenti di primo livello, con l'introduzione della previsione che per i direttori di rete, canale e testata sia obbligatoria - ma non vincolante - l'acquisizione del parere del consiglio di amministrazione. Per i direttori di testata, tale parere, se espresso a maggioranza dei due terzi, assume invece carattere vincolante (ricordo che i due terzi sono cinque consiglieri su sette). Con riferimento ai poteri in materia di reclutamento del personale, si è stabilito che l'amministratore delegato, sentito il parere del consiglio di amministrazione, definisca i criteri e le modalità per tale reclutamento nonché quelli per il conferimento di incarichi a collaboratori esterni, in conformità con quanto indicato, per le società a partecipazione pubblica, nel decreto-legge n. 112 del 2008, individuando i profili professionali e gli incarichi per i quali, in relazione agli specifici compiti assegnati, può derogarsi a tali criteri e modalità. Nel corso dell'esame in Commissione è stata poi introdotta l'indicazione dettagliata sia delle cause che possono far venir meno i requisiti di onorabilità e provocare l'ineleggibilità o la decadenza in corso di mandato dalla carica di amministratore delegato, sia dei requisiti professionali richiesti per poter essere nominato. È stato inoltre soppresso il divieto per un dipendente della RAI di diventare amministratore delegato, prevedendo che, in caso di nomina, egli sia tenuto a dimettersi dalla società o a mettersi in aspettativa non retribuita per la durata dell'incarico. Si è stabilito che la durata dell'incarico non possa eccedere la scadenza del consiglio di amministrazione, mentre la facoltà di revoca resta affidata al consiglio, sentito il parere dell'assemblea. Nell'anno successivo al termine del mandato, inoltre, l'amministratore delegato non può assumere incarichi o fornire consulenze a società concorrenti della RAI. Nel confermare le funzioni di indirizzo generale e vigilanza dei servizi pubblici radiotelevisivi della Commissione parlamentare di vigilanza, già previste nel testo originario del provvedimento, si stabilisce che il consiglio di amministrazione debba riferire semestralmente (e non più solo annualmente), prima dell'approvazione del bilancio, a tale Commissione, consegnando l'elenco completo dei nominativi degli ospiti invitati o partecipanti alle trasmissioni. Viene infine integrata la norma sull'adeguamento dello statuto della RAI a quanto introdotto con il provvedimento in esame, prevedendo che il parere sulle modifiche allo statuto sia espresso esclusivamente dall'assemblea straordinaria della RAI. Per quanto riguarda l'articolo 3, la soppressione del comma 49- quater è conseguente alla collocazione nell'articolo 2 del provvedimento delle norme già descritte. Speriamo di poter intervenire sull'articolo 3 nel corso della discussione in Assemblea, perché credo che dovremo apportare qualche modifica per quanto riguarda le gare che hanno per oggetto il prodotto culturale, che non possono essere omologate a quelle per l'acquisizione di servizi o di beni, ma presentano sicuramente caratteristiche diverse. L'8ᵃ Commissione è poi intervenuta sull'articolo 4 del provvedimento, al fine di integrare le disposizioni relative alla delega al Governo per la disciplina del finanziamento pubblico della RAI. In particolare, si è ampliato l'oggetto della delega includendovi anche la disciplina del finanziamento dell'emittenza locale (e questa, a mio avviso, è una importante novità per tutti i nostri territori) al fine di riconoscere e qualificare la funzione di pubblico interesse svolta e di garantire a tale settore adeguata certezza di risorse. È stato inoltre specificato che la revisione della disciplina del finanziamento pubblico della RAI è finalizzata a garantire indipendenza economica e finanziaria della società quale attuale concessionaria del servizio pubblico. Anche qui faccio una piccola parentesi, e dico che, quando si parla di indipendenza della RAI, questo è il punto fondamentale. Noi non possiamo, infatti, parlare di una RAI indipendente, se questa non è indipendente dal punto di vista economico e finanziario. Una RAI che dovesse dipendere ogni anno dalla volontà di un qualsiasi Governo o di un qualsiasi Parlamento non sarebbe realmente indipendente. Faccio un esempio. In Aula è presente il presidente Carraro. Ebbene, il CONI è sempre stato indipendente fino a quando ha potuto esserlo grazie al Totocalcio. Dopo, lo sport italiano, avendo perso il Totocalcio e avendo perso quella sua fonte di finanziamento assolutamente autonoma, è diventato dipendente dalla volontà e dalle decisioni sia del Parlamento che del Governo. Questo la RAI non se lo può permettere. Ulteriori modifiche riguardano la procedura per l'adozione dei decreti legislativi attuativi della delega, con un rafforzamento del ruolo delle Commissioni parlamentari. Anche questo è molto importante, per quanto riguarda l'Aula e le Commissioni. È stato infatti stabilito che sugli schemi venga acquisito il parere delle Commissioni competenti sia per materia che per i profili finanziari, prevedendo la necessità di un secondo invio in Parlamento qualora il Governo non intenda conformarsi ai pareri espressi. Quindi, ancora una volta la centralità del Parlamento viene messa in evidenza. Con riferimento all'articolo 5, l'8ᵃ Commissione ha modificato i principi e i criteri per l'esercizio della delega conferita al Governo per la revisione del testo unico dei servizi di media audiovisivi e radiofonici. In particolare, e questo è un punto molto importante, in quanto è un punto politico di tutti i Gruppi, accogliendo una richiesta espressa da tutti i Gruppi durante il dibattito in Commissione, è stato soppresso il criterio di delega relativo alla ridefinizione dei compiti del servizio pubblico, che comprendeva anche un riferimento alle diverse piattaforme tecnologiche e alle esigenze dell'innovazione tecnologica e delle convergenze delle piattaforme distributive. Si è infatti ritenuto che tale tematica meritasse una trattazione a sé stante, in un disegno di legge autonomo. E devo ringraziare il Governo perché ha convenuto che un argomento così importante dovesse avere una trattazione con un disegno di legge autonomo. Sono state poi introdotte altre modifiche, tra cui si segnalano nuovi principi relativi alla trasmissione di contenuti destinati ai minori, alla diffusione delle trasmissioni televisive e radiofoniche su tutto il territorio nazionale e nelle zone dove sono presenti minoranze linguistiche. La procedura per l'adozione dei decreti legislativi relativi a tale delega ricalca quella già descritta all'articolo 4, con il doppio parere parlamentare. L'articolo 6 è stato modificato per consentire l'applicazione delle disposizioni sulla nomina del consiglio di amministrazione della RAI, introdotte dal testo in esame, dalla data di entrata in vigore della legge stessa. È stata infine disciplinata la prima applicazione delle norme introdotte con riferimento alla procedura per la nomina dei membri del consiglio di amministrazione, che dovrà concludersi entro 30 giorni dall'entrata in vigore del provvedimento. Vorrei concludere con una riflessione e un auspicio. La RAI negli anni '60 accompagnò il Paese nella sua crescita. Gli anni del boom, ce lo ricordiamo tutti.

Signor Presidente, questa mattina sarei voluto intervenire per non più di trenta secondi durante gli interventi svolti sulle modalità di composizione delle Commissioni permanenti, ma la sua collega Lanzillotta mi ha detto che non potevo, facendo parte del Gruppo <PARTY>, poiché il mio Capogruppo aveva già parlato. Vorrei tuttavia lasciare agli atti il mio imbarazzo e anche il profondo dissenso per le cose che il Capogruppo del <PARTY>, senatore Zanda, ha detto stamani. La prima è la seguente: citando la collega De Petris che, come sappiamo, è Presidente del Gruppo <PARTY>, le ha detto che era stata eletta con i voti del <PARTY>. Vorrei quindi ricordare al senatore Zanda che anche lui e anche io siamo stati eletti anche con i voti di Sinistra, Ecologia e Libertà, perché nel 2013 ci siamo presentati con una coalizione. Vorrei inoltre ricordare a tutti che il premio di maggioranza che si è conquistato alla Camera, e grazie al quale una legge elettorale chiamata Italicum è diventata legge dello Stato, è stato ottenuto dalla coalizione nella quale c'erano sia Sinistra, Ecologia e Libertà che il <PARTY>: quindi bisognerebbe stare attenti a rivendicare il possesso dei voti: in democrazia nessuno è padrone dei voti. La seconda cosa che vorrei dire a tutti, signor Presidente, anche a lei, è che mi ha molto stupito una frase del senatore Zanda quando ha detto che tre senatori del <PARTY> avrebbero sostenuto la nomina a Presidente del Gruppo <PARTY> della senatrice De Petris. Dunque, il <PARTY>, a mia insaputa, ha truccato l'elezione del Presidente del Gruppo <PARTY>? E la Presidenza del Senato lo sapeva? Forse è per questo che ci sono in quest'Aula due Gruppi Misti: uno che si chiama <PARTY> e l'altro <PARTY>? Vorrei saperlo perché è fondamentale, signor Presidente, che le regole valgano per tutti. È ovvio: un senatore che non è Capogruppo non può intervenire sul richiamo al Regolamento, ma deve essere anche ovvio che è previsto un Gruppo <PARTY>. Pertanto, vorrei capire chi era a conoscenza e che senso aveva quell'azione svelata stamani dal mio presidente Zanda. Non mi fermo qui. Sarò brevissimo, ma voglio aggiungere un'altra considerazione. Non si possono difendere i diritti della maggioranza sempre e a ogni costo. Se, per esempio, dei parlamentari che facevano parte di un alleanza di centro guidata dal senatore Monti sono passati nelle file... <p> MINEO (<PARTY>). Voglio dire che se si accolgono i passaggi da un Gruppo all'altro se conviene alla maggioranza, bisognerà poi essere rispettosi anche delle minoranze. Finisco ricordando al senatore Zanda che io sono stato sostituito dopo aver iniziato tutto il dibattito preliminare in Commissione affari costituzionali, ed è stato detto dal senatore Zanda che ciò non cambiava la sostanza dell'articolo 67 della Costituzione per quanto riguarda le Commissioni, che non c'è mai stato un dibattito su questo tema, né in Gruppo né in Senato. Quindi sulle regole del gioco bisognerebbe essere più attenti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5060991048812866, 0.49390092492103577]}, {'sequence': \"Gentile Presidente, colleghi senatori, oggi ci troviamo a discutere un provvedimento che avrebbe dovuto fornire, mesi fa, risposte alle imprese colpite dall'emergenza sanitaria. Non solo arriva con un ritardo disarmante, ma arriva incompleto e non soddisfacente. <p> Ci sono Regioni che hanno dovuto supplire alle mancanze governative, raccogliendo le istanze delle categorie maggiormente danneggiate e studiando strategie efficaci ed immediate, attingendo anche ai fondi propri pur di sostenere le imprese coinvolte nella crisi in corso. <p> Vogliamo qui portare all'attenzione dell'Assemblea e del Paese la pesante situazione in cui si vengono a trovare, a causa della crisi provocata dall'epidemia, alcune Regioni, in particolare la mia. <p> La Regione a Statuto speciale Friuli-Venezia Giulia è una Regione virtuosa, un contributore netto in quanto versa allo Stato più di quanto riceve. In particolare, dal 2011 la Regione è tenuta a versare allo Stato un contributo straordinario che la stessa ha chiesto di sospendere, per ovvi motivi. <p> Il Friuli-Venezia Giulia si approvvigiona esclusivamente attraverso risorse proprie, senza trasferimenti da Roma. <p> Il 30 maggio, a ventisei giorni dall'uscita dal lockdown, a dodici dalla riapertura di bar, ristoranti e altre attività commerciali, i dati dell'Istituto superiore della sanità hanno certificato che il Friuli-Venezia Giulia è tra le Regioni con i migliori risultati nella lotta al coronavirus. La nostra piccola, ma immensa Regione, orgoglio di tutti noi friulani e giuliani, rientra tra i territori non a rischio per gli spostamenti dopo il 3 giugno. Il Friuli-Venezia Giulia è anche protagonista nella lotta al Covid. L'ospedale di Cattinara a Trieste ha investito in una nuova macchina che ha la capacità di fare 2000 tamponi in più al giorno. Ciò significa individuare più rapidamente la filiera dei contagiati ed evitare che possano diventare veicolo inconsapevole dell'epidemia. Il nostro governatore Fedriga parla con i fatti: ha stanziato contributi e incentivi per più di 50 milioni di euro a beneficio di imprese e lavoratori, semplificando anche le pratiche burocratiche per agevolare le attività in questa fase drammatica di guerra tra i poveri causata dal Covid-19. Nonostante questa intraprendenza di grande aiuto nella lotta al virus, lo Stato pretende dal Friuli-Venezia Giulia 726 milioni di euro, a fronte di una riduzione delle entrate stimata in circa 700 milioni. Si vogliono annientare le Regioni e la loro virtuosa autonomia, colpendole per indebolire e creare il peggiore dei mali: la dipendenza.

Signor Presidente, signor vice ministro Bubbico, colleghi senatori, ho rinunciato ad intervenire nel dibattito generale perché su questo argomento la relazione della Commissione antimafia e il contenuto della proposta di risoluzione presentata dai Capigruppo sono esaustivi da molti punti di vista. Vorrei però richiamare l'attenzione, in particolare quella del Governo, su una serie di questioni che, se non affrontate andando alla sostanza al di là dei formalismi e degli aspetti di rigore puramente formale, renderanno problematico il raggiungimento dell'obiettivo principale di un utilizzo pieno di questa ricchezza rappresentata dal patrimonio confiscato alle organizzazioni mafiose. La prima questione che voglio porre all'attenzione del Governo è quella relativa ai tempi che intercorrono tra il sequestro dei beni e la loro confisca definitiva. In questo lasso di tempo, la nostra esperienza ci dice che questi beni sono sottoposti a un processo di decadimento e di depauperamento che è sicuramente esiziale per il mantenimento del valore del bene confiscato. Quindi, su tale questione bisogna concentrare non soltanto l'attenzione normativa, ma anche le sensibilità degli organi preposti all'azione di sequestro e successivamente di confisca, certo rispettando le garanzie previste nel processo, ma nello stesso tempo avendo consapevolezza che il tempo in questo caso deve essere tempo breve, a salvaguardia della ricchezza che viene messa nelle mani dello Stato. La seconda questione che desidero richiamare alla vostra attenzione, signor Vice Ministro e colleghi senatori, è relativa alla qualità degli amministratori giudiziari. Certo, l'albo è utile ma, se non si procede a una selezione che introduca elementi di alta qualità professionale ed imprenditoriale nonché l'elemento caratteristico dell'azione imprenditoriale, ossia il rischio, queste aziende, che ovviamente - come ricordava lei, signor Vice Ministro - provengono da un mercato protetto, molto spesso artificiale, corrono rischi molto gravi. Quindi, una capacità imprenditoriale spinta deve essere prevista per gli amministratori giudiziari. In caso contrario, la gestione burocratica dei beni, attraverso certamente il rispetto rigoroso delle norme, ma senza l'applicazione di quello che è il criterio della diligenza del buon padre di famiglia, ovvero - usando un termine piuttosto rozzo - dell'«occhio del padrone che ingrassa il cavallo», depaupera in maniera particolarmente grave il patrimonio affidato. Bisogna certamente introdurre, signor Vice Ministro, una dotazione di capitale di rischio proveniente dai beni liquidi sequestrati: senza un capitale di rischio potenziato, infatti, molte di queste aziende e molti patrimoni sono destinati alla cancellazione. Il tempo passa, le problematiche occupazionali sono evidenti, in molti casi la resa dello Stato è semplicemente procrastinata nel tempo, ma quelle imprese e quei patrimoni sono destinati a una conclusione piuttosto nefasta. Quindi, mettere a disposizione un capitale di rischio accanto a una professionalità imprenditoriale effettiva può consentire di riportare in una posizione di mercato legale quelle aziende che - ribadisco - hanno vissuto in un mercato protetto e molto spesso illegale. Questo capitale deve garantire la capacità di sviluppare l'azione imprenditoriale, come è necessario per qualsiasi azienda, anche quelle aziende che operano nel mercato legale. Inoltre, bisogna creare una strumentazione specifica per i beni che non possono sopravvivere nelle condizioni date, territoriali e di contingenza economica, e che debbono essere alienati, perché il loro mantenimento in una situazione di incertezza contribuisce alla loro distruzione dal punto di vista della ricchezza che rappresentano. Per le aziende si pone certamente, in maniera seria, il problema della loro ricollocazione senza essere riconsegnate alle organizzazioni criminali, che possono muoversi all'interno di un mercato opaco per recuperare i beni attraverso un riacquisto del mercato stesso. Si pone inoltre - e concludo colleghi - un utilizzo non fittizio di tutti i beni che vengono affidati alle associazioni e alle organizzazioni che operano nel campo dell'antimafia. Nell'esperienza della Commissione antimafia abbiamo avuto molto spesso contezza della difficoltà di queste organizzazioni a mantenere, in condizioni di effettiva e concreta attività economica, i beni oppure a finalizzarli a un effettivo utilizzo di interesse pubblico. Dobbiamo evitare che questi beni vengano parcheggiati senza avere la consapevolezza che il parcheggio è esiziale per la loro prospettiva. Questo problema si pone sicuramente per i beni immobili e le imprese, ma vi è un problema collegato ai beni mobili sequestrati. Troppe amministrazioni, signor Ministro, attendono l'assegnazione, in particolare di automobili e di mezzi di trasporto di cui hanno fatto richiesta, e i tempi sono troppi lunghi. Sappiamo che, anche in questo caso, i tempi concorrono al depauperamento del bene e privano, tra l'altro, lo Stato e le amministrazioni territoriali pubbliche di un eventuale bene che, invece, dovrebbe essere reperito sul mercato normale se non vengono messi a disposizione i beni sequestrati e confiscati. Occorre, quindi, rigore gestionale non solo formale ma anche sostanziale, attenzione alla tutela del bene e della sua consistenza e, ribadisco, l'applicazione del criterio della diligenza del buon padre di famiglia, che è quello che fa funzionare bene qualsiasi organizzazione.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5028288960456848, 0.4971711039543152]}, {'sequence': 'Presidente, la 5ᵃ Commissione è ancora riunita!

Non ci pare neppure che stiate facendo tesoro di quanto vi abbiamo ripetutamente sottoposto in tutte le circostanze in cui ne abbiamo avuto occasione in materia di proroga dello stato di emergenza. <p> Sono ormai nove mesi e anche un \"parto difficile\" dovrebbe giungere a conclusione, invece con la richiesta di proroga a tutto il mese di gennaio 2021 palesate che questi nove mesi sono trascorsi inutilmente, posto che non c\\'è alcuna evidenza di avere trasformato in procedure concrete e ordinarie quanto inizialmente avrebbe potuto essere giustificabile che venisse affrontato in regime di procedure straordinarie ed emergenziali. <p> A luglio, quando avete proposto di prorogare a tutto il 15 di ottobre lo stato di emergenza, vi avevamo rinnovato, in chiave di cooperazione e non di competizione, l\\'indicazione del percorso da intraprendere: il piano di prevenzione, preparazione e contrasto dell\\'eventuale recrudescenza epidemica, nel quale avrebbero dovuto essere esplicitate e disciplinate le procedure per affrontare in modo tempestivo e appropriato tutte le azioni e gli interventi che sembrano essere indicati dal comitato tecnico-scientifico in quello che ha previsto come il peggior scenario da affrontare in caso di recrudescenza incontrollata.

Logica vorrebbe che, per recuperare in credibilità, trattandosi di un intervento emergenziale, lo smentiste in questa sede, con dati inoppugnabili, dando certezza del fatto che tutti gli italiani, in adesione consapevole, possano eccezionalmente fruire della vaccinazione antinfluenzale, quale livello essenziale di assistenza in emergenza, e non solo quindi per la profilassi della solita influenza stagionale, ma in quanto - come pare - blando antidoto anti-Covid.

Come al solito le promesse da marinaio, ovvero le chiacchiere del DEF e i numeri fantasiosi della legge bilancio, ci rendono la solita figura da Pinocchio. Sono serena, per carità - di nome e di fatto - e vorrei anche credere con fiducia a quanto detto dal ministro Padoan, che ci prospetta una crescita del 2 per cento. Sinceramente però - sarà perché sono un po\\' miope - non riesco ad andare oltre la situazione critica in cui versa l\\'economia reale, quella dei tanti imprenditori e liberi professionisti, che sono vessati da mille emendamenti e da mille incertezze e dalla volontà di metterli tutti nella condizione di dover pagare sempre e subito e, invece, di ricevere solo se va bene e comunque tardi. <p> Mi riferisco in particolare allo split payment, nato con l\\'intento di ridurre l\\'evasione fiscale, per aumentare il gettito a favore dello Stato, che rappresenta però, di fatto, non una pioggia sul bagnato, ma una grandine che distrugge ciò che di sano nella nostra economia reale è rimasto. La pubblica amministrazione è il peggior cliente che imprese e professionisti possano avere. Signori miei, lo split payment uccide le imprese. Imprenditori e professionisti già devono pagare in anticipo il 20 per cento dell\\' IRPEF, con il meccanismo della ritenuta d\\'acconto e hanno l\\'obbligo della fatturazione elettronica, con la nuova trasmissione trimestrale dell\\'IVA, con tanto di vessazione dello spesometro, introdotta proprio per avere uno strumento antievasione, perché in questo modo si tracciano tutti i compensi ricevuti. In tal modo siamo diventati tutti Bancomat di uno Stato inadempiente ed inefficiente. Lo split payment altro non è che un finanziamento forzoso allo Stato da parte di privati, imprese e professionisti che lavorano con la pubblica amministrazione. Ma non contento, lo Stato, sempre con il suo stile burocratese e assurdo, prova a metterci una pezza che è peggio del buco. Noi abbiamo sostituito l\\'efficienza e la preparazione dell\\'ENA francese, che sforna politici illuminati che vanno verso la deregolamentazione, la semplificazione e l\\'apertura, con una laurea che sembra data dall\\'\"ufficio complicazioni cose semplici\". Ulteriore burocrazia che consiste nel dover chiedere allo Stato quanto mi è dovuto, con annessi costi da parte di privati e della stessa Agenzia delle entrate: l\\'amministrazione infatti è così complicata e contorta che complica la vita ai privati cittadini, ma se la complica essa stessa; il tutto in tempi che vanno dai sei mesi ai due anni. Inoltre, lo split payment mette in conflitto imprenditori, professionisti e imprese che vantino un credito di IVA di tipo ordinario nei confronti dello Stato e quelli che sono obbligati dalla legge ad avere un credito IVA. Si genera una competizione tra privati per vedere garantito un proprio legittimo diritto. La logica vorrebbe che, in tutti i casi in cui sostituisce un automatismo d\\'imposta con una nuova procedura, questa sia più efficiente e renda l\\'attività di impresa più facile. Invece cosa è successo? Il Governo, lungi dal risolvere un problema esistente, estende questo meccanismo a tutte le imprese e i professionisti, sottoponendoli a un\\'inutile e dannosa barbarie. Quello che avreste dovuto fare, urgentemente, era una cosa sola: estendere il pagamento dell\\'IVA per cassa a tutte le categorie, risolvendo così tutti i problemi collegati e aumentando davvero il <PARTY>L. Perché quando si rende certezza della legge, quando le attese sono chiare e soddisfatte, c\\'è anche una propensione automatica ad investire e fare impresa. Ma se, da un lato, al fine di reperire risorse, si trovano soluzioni aberranti e dannose per le imprese, dall\\'altro ben sappiamo come impiegarle; è sconcertante come in questo decreto-legge, da un lato, si sposti il peso della manovra sulle imprese già massacrate dalla crisi e senza liquidità e, dall\\'altro, si foraggi il lusso e il superfluo. Anche in questa manovra il Governo ha reinserito un premuroso pensiero alla Ryder Cup 2022, come già tentato nel milleproroghe e nel disegno di legge sulla concorrenza: guarda caso, tutti provvedimenti che passano con la fiducia e non attraverso il confronto. L\\'articolo 63 prevede la concessione di 97 milioni di euro a favore della Ryder Cup Europe, che si aggiungono alla quota già stanziata dalla legge di bilancio 2017. I contribuenti pagano e ripagano: prima la parte pubblica, ora la garanzia per gli investimenti privati. Io capisco che le banche abbiano bisogno di garanzie; capisco che devono essere molto oculate, ma devo essere io cittadino ad assicurarle? Io che, quando vado in banca e chiedo un prestito, trovo sempre la porta chiusa? Io devo garantire la banca? Noi vincoliamo in questo momento 97 milioni che lo Stato avrebbe potuto rivolgere verso esigenze davvero urgenti e davvero indifferibili. Vi ricordo il terremoto, che sta ancora tutto là. A proposito del terremoto, l\\'unico aspetto positivo di questo decreto-legge è l\\'istituzione di zone franche urbane, che io sinceramente ho sollecitato più volte. Addirittura sono depositati diversi disegni di legge che bastava copiare, ma neanche quello è stato fatto, perché anche in questo provvedimento si è riusciti a fare una norma totalmente avulsa dalla realtà; una norma che non tiene conto di come va l\\'economia e del Paese, e non ha considerato nessun suggerimento. Mi chiedo come si possa pensare di istituire una zona franca urbana, che in quest\\'Aula è stata sollecitata più volte anche dalla sottoscritta già dallo scorso dicembre, che preveda dei benefici fiscali - ascoltate bene - riconosciuti alle imprese che abbiano avuto una diminuzione del 20 per cento del fatturato, non dell\\'utile. Quindi, da una parte, cercate di arginare l\\'evasione e, dall\\'altra, la favorite e la sollecitate. In che periodo? Dal 1° settembre al 31 dicembre 2016. Vi ricordo che il terremoto è avvenuto ad agosto ma è ovvio che i danni del terremoto non possono essere limitati al 2016 e vanno avanti. Tutto rispetto al corrispettivo periodo del 2015: sarebbe stato utile, giusto e congruo un confronto ma non con un periodo di tempo così limitato e non in questi termini. Questa formulazione equivale, di fatto, a non concedere il beneficio a nessuno e ad assicurare l\\'evasione fiscale per qualcuno che magari ci prova. Per non parlare del fatto che le agevolazioni sono concesse per soli due anni, ma un investimento, se il sollievo è di soli due anni, non trova ristoro quando vai a confrontarti con una realtà già provata e difficoltosa in partenza. Siamo a giugno 2017 e vi assicuro che le macerie sono ancora lì, la ricostruzione non è iniziata e i sopralluoghi non sono finiti. Siamo nel totale subbuglio, però avete previsto anche la possibilità di agevolare le aziende che investono in queste zone. Benissimo, però il beneficio è limitato soltanto a quelle che avviano l\\'impresa, all\\'interno della zona franca, entro il 31 dicembre 2017. Siamo a giugno, ci sono le macerie e non ci sono le vie di comunicazione; ma chi andrà ad investire in quelle zone entro dicembre 2017? A mio parere tutto ciò non è serio. Sa proprio di presa in giro. Sinceramente un cittadino che legge una norma così, può pensare soltanto una cosa: che è stata fatta da persone che veramente è bene che si conservino la poltrona perché possono campare solo di politica e non sanno cosa vuol dire fare impresa, non sanno cosa significa lavorare, non sanno cos\\'è la vita reale.

Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ci troviamo ancora una volta qui in Aula a parlare dell'ennesimo provvedimento che cerca di risolvere l'ormai stancante problema, di cui stiamo parlando quotidianamente in quest'Aula, del sovraffollamento delle carceri. Ricordiamo ancora che in Italia i problemi, quando arrivano in quest'Aula, sono quasi sempre mediamente incancreniti. Il problema del sovraffollamento delle carceri non è un problema che va risolto, come si sta cercando di fare ora, con questi che continuiamo a chiamare provvedimenti-tampone. È un problema che doveva essere affrontato, in maniera veramente sistematica, qualche tempo fa, perché l'unico modo per cercare di risolvere l'annosa questione di una sovrabbondanza di detenuti rispetto alla capienza delle carceri era costruire nuove carceri. Ci troviamo, invece, a fare un ragionamento e un'operazione esattamente contrari a ciò che doveva avvenire a monte. Noi dovevamo determinare il numero e le dimensioni delle carceri a seconda del numero dei detenuti e non, a questo punto, determinare il numero dei detenuti a seconda della dimensione delle carceri. Se attualmente le carceri possono ospitare 45.000-47.000 persone, non si capisce perché dobbiamo necessariamente liberarne altri 20.000. Questo è un problema grave dell'Italia. È un problema gravissimo non avere neanche elaborato dei sistemi per costruire nuove carceri. Dei programmi erano cominciati, e poi, come sempre accade in questo Paese, sono stati abbandonati. Si cominciano e poi si abbandonano, e non si porta avanti un programma in modo coerente fino in fondo. Oggi ci ritroviamo con l'assenza di posti all'interno di queste carceri e con un problema, effettivamente, anche di dignità delle persone che devono viverci dentro. Ma noi della Lega Nord continuiamo a dire che è assurdo dover risolvere un problema come questo adottando, come stiamo facendo adesso, una miriade continua di piccoli provvedimenti. Ricordo che, dall'inizio della legislatura ad oggi, in Commissione giustizia abbiamo parlato di questo problema per la maggior parte del tempo. Adottiamo continuamente tali provvedimenti e temiamo di giungere, probabilmente, a ridosso dell'inizio degli effetti della sentenza Torreggiani, a dover probabilmente adottare un provvedimento clemenziale. E dubito che, tra i colleghi presenti in quest'Aula e quelli alla Camera dei deputati, ci sia la volontà di tutti di arrivare ad un'amnistia o a un indulto. C'è una sentenza, che è nota, ma sappiamo benissimo che, per i nostri concittadini, sentir parlare di amnistia e di indulto, soprattutto in questo momento, sarà assolutamente inaccettabile. <p> E neanche i buoni propositi ed il bel modo di esporli del presidente Renzi riusciranno a convincere la nostra gente. Abbiamo adesso l'ennesimo provvedimento che prevede forme più o meno volte alla liberazione o alla non carcerazione di molti criminali. <p> Sono qui a ricordare a tutti i colleghi cosa abbiamo fatto, perché a luglio dell'anno scorso abbiamo parlato dell'istituto della sospensione della pena, poi siamo arrivati a parlare dell'estensione dell'applicazione dell'istituto degli arresti domiciliari, fino ad includere in quel provvedimento tutta una serie di depenalizzazioni. Nello stesso provvedimento di cui si sta discutendo oggi alla Camera, abbiamo cominciato a parlare dell'istituto della messa alla prova: stiamo dicendo a tutti coloro che seguono la nostra attività qui in Parlamento che vi sono sconti di pena tali per cui, per quanto riguarda la liberazione anticipata si passa da 45 a 75 giorni ogni 6 mesi, addirittura con un calcolo con effetto retroattivo al 2010. <p> Arriviamo a dire che al colpevole di un reato può essere applicata la cosiddetta messa alla prova: ma come andiamo a spiegarlo alla persona offesa dal reato, a chi lo ha subito, a chi è vittima e si vede quel criminale condannato agli arresti domiciliari - che poi, per quanto si possa considerare limitativo restare a casa propria, mi capirete se dico che è sempre meglio che stare dentro ad una cella - o a seguire il percorso rieducativo della messa alla prova, che può portare addirittura all'estinzione del reato? Possiamo dire che, conteggiando la liberazione anticipata in quella che avrebbe dovuto essere la pena, uno si ritrova ad essere liberato prima. <p> Questo è incomprensibile a tutta la gente, in un momento in cui - basta leggere i giornali - non si fa che parlare di continue rapine e furti in appartamento. Sono queste le problematiche. Possiamo stare qui a parlare della legge elettorale, del nostro Senato e della sorte che esso avrà, ma poi, alla fine, quello che conta per le persone che stanno a casa a vedere veramente cosa stiamo facendo è arrivare alla fine del mese, vivere in un Paese tranquillo, riuscire a fare le loro spese e le loro vacanze, seguire i propri figli, pagare la rata dell'asilo e vedere puniti i criminali. <p> Ed è quello che non stiamo facendo: la sensazione di chi è criminale e sta fuori da quest'Aula è che tanto, qui in Italia, per un certo reato e per una certa pena si può trovare qualche maniera per tirare avanti, tanto prima o poi un provvedimento contenente un beneficio alla fine arriva. <p> Non è questo il messaggio che dobbiamo passare. Noi della Lega Nord non siamo giustizialisti, come ci accusa forse qualcuno di essere. Stiamo soltanto dicendo che in una società come la nostra, in un momento di crisi economica, che - ricordiamocelo - diventa sociale, se si tolgono certezze alle famiglie ed alle persone, dobbiamo dare una sensazione di rigore. Dobbiamo trasmettere una sensazione di rigore dell'attività che facciamo e dei processi, per far sapere, ad esempio, che chi commette un reato va in galera ed è punito come previsto. O quantomeno dobbiamo far vedere che il processo viene condotto in un periodo di tempo ordinario, da considerarsi ragionevole. <p> In Italia non sta accadendo questo: se uno oggi arriva dentro ad un tribunale, si trova con le udienze delle cause rinviate a tempi assurdi ed incomprensibili. <p> Il cittadino si chiede: ma dov'è la giustizia? E sorge spontanea la domanda: ma dov'è la politica? Quello che dobbiamo fare non è perderci nel risolvere il singolo problema che appare come un'emergenza. Bisogna piuttosto guardare tutto in un'ottica veramente complessiva, sistematica e generale per capire cosa si vuol fare di questo Paese. <p> Noi della Lega Nord continueremo questa battaglia, che faremo in questa Assemblea e fuori, e continueremo ad insistere mantenendo rigore e grande serietà in quello che facciamo.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.536072850227356, 0.46392711997032166]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> <PARTY>CCOLI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, colleghi, signor Sottosegretario, il nostro Gruppo voterà convintamente a favore della mozione presentata dalla maggioranza, a prima firma del senatore Morgoni. Essa propone un articolato insieme di indicazioni relative al potenziale utilizzo del combustibile solido secondario in alcune specifiche tipologie di impianti industriali: nella fattispecie i cementifici. Il documento si pone quale espressione di una prima fase di indirizzo orientata a rispondere con iniziative concrete, vorrei dire «del fare», a problematiche complesse in materia ambientale e di tutela della salute che richiedono urgenti interventi ad integrazione delle politiche sino ad oggi attivate, alla luce del crescente aumento della produzione dei rifiuti e della ricerca di nuove soluzioni, alla luce, inoltre, della necessità di fornire, in tutte le fasi di attuazione, chiare indicazioni alle comunità locali più prossime agli impianti. Data la vastità della materia è possibile soffermarsi solo su qualche punto. Il primo punto è il seguente. In particolare, la mozione richiede al Governo una serie di azioni che, se lette in maniera isolata, possono sembrare scontate ma per le quali, al contrario, si richiede un'analisi d'insieme, finalizzata ad evidenziarne la significatività metodologica e la potenzialità di sistema. Mi spiego. Ciò che nel complesso la mozione richiede con forza e immediatezza è un'attività di comparazione con esperienze in essere, di attenta analisi e di approfondimento tecnico-scientifico sugli effetti di ciascuna azione, senza che preconcetti, conclusioni affrettate e carenza di verifiche dichiarino a priori la percorribilità o la non percorribilità di una soluzione. Il secondo punto che mi pare opportuno evidenziare è il seguente. Va ricordato che il riutilizzo ai fini energetici e produttivi del combustile solido secondario è già stato oggetto di apposita disciplina, in particolare - come previsto dal decreto ministeriale n. 22 del 2013 - per quanto concerne le attività di controllo. Allo stesso modo, esiti di approfondimenti scientifici sperimentali hanno consentito di rilevare un miglioramento dell'impatto emissivo delle combustioni praticate nei cementifici allorquando si è fatto ricorso al CSS in co-combustione. Tuttavia, si pongono quesiti cui rispondere in dettaglio in merito al connubio tecnologia - salute umana - e ambiente. In terzo luogo, ferma restando, dunque, una costante attività di ricerca tecnica che consenta di aggiornare le condizioni tecnologiche ed operative alle quali attenersi scrupolosamente per permettere l'utilizzo del CSS negli impianti industriali, si propongono al Governo iniziative collegate strettamente con il concetto di trasparenza nell'applicazione di processi industriali. Proprio al fine di far convivere il pragmatismo delle iniziative con la tutela della salute dei cittadini e la compatibilità con l'ambiente, si prefigura un sistema nel quale l'utilizzo del combustibile solido secondario sia oggetto di monitoraggio e informazione costante. Oltre alla previsione di norme specifiche per il completo rispetto delle disposizioni comunitarie e alla costituzione di appositi organismi di controllo, si pone in evidenza l'importanza di imporre l'attivazione di un sistema - come già detto in altri interventi - di permanente monitoraggio ambientale, con l'obbligo di pubblicazione on line dei risultati via via raccolti; in tal modo si avvia un sistema di confronto chiaro e dinamico con il territorio ove gli impianti sono collocati. Tra l'altro, va detto che questo schema di controllo degli effluenti e di monitoraggio e di comunicazione delle condizioni di esercizio può essere garantito con efficaci e affidabili sistemi di rilevazione degli indicatori, generali e puntuali, a fronte di costi ridotti. È evidente, poi, come un sistema di autorizzazioni all'esercizio, strutturato sulla base di elementi di chiarezza e attrezzato per fornire continue informazioni, rappresenta uno strumento di maggiore garanzia per il buon esito degli investimenti troppo spesso soggetti, nel nostro Paese, a continue incertezze - vorrei dire incertezze fino all'ultimo bullone, con una battuta - con la dannosissima conseguenza di scoraggiare gli investitori. Il quarto punto da evidenziare è il seguente. Si tratta, dunque, di condividere un metodo che successivamente porti alla costruzione di un modello attuativo di maggiore garanzia rispetto alle politiche sin qui seguite. Va da sé che un tale passo richiede altresì di ricercare con costanza ed obiettività gli strumenti che dimostreranno il maggior grado di adeguatezza a tutte le problematiche sottese. La mozione fornisce in tal senso un insieme di indicazioni metodologiche molto puntuali (ben dodici punti) che richiedono una forte garanzia di serietà dell'approccio. Tra questi vi è l'impegno di aggiornare, ad esito dell' iter suggerito, la normativa di settore. In quinto luogo, si reputa opportuno richiamare la confortante esperienza - anch'essa citata dalla mozione e in altri interventi - di altre Nazioni europee, in alcune delle quali il riutilizzo dei rifiuti nei cementifici è una pratica largamente diffusa, collaudata, ritenuta vantaggiosa per l'ambiente se raffrontata con l'uso di combustibili fossili e con pratiche di elevata compatibilità. Le tecnologie applicate hanno consentito di far riconoscere a livello europeo la combustione dei CSS come la miglior pratica disponibile con tassi di sostituzione termica dei combustibili fossili in costante crescita. Nel 2011 tali valori erano pari al 98 per cento in Olanda, al 61 per cento in Germania, al 45 per cento in Austria e Polonia, al 30 per cento in Francia. Valori che si commentano da soli. In sesto luogo, nel complesso le azioni di analisi, informazione e monitoraggio sono dunque chieste al Governo da subito, affinché la pratica dell'utilizzo dei combustibili solidi secondari diventi eventualmente efficacemente operativa e vorrei dire serenamente applicabile anche nel nostro Paese, inserendosi tra le buone pratiche volte a garantire una soluzione a lungo termine nel trattamento dei rifiuti o di una porzione di essi attraverso, sia chiaro, la predisposizione di linee guida specifiche cui attenersi con scrupolo. Molti altri punti potrebbero essere evidenziati a supporto dei contenuti della mozione. Ciò che maggiormente merita un'ultima sottolineatura è la necessità di implementare - va ribadito - una nuova impostazione metodologica rispetto al problema di cui si sta trattando. In conclusione, le scelte di azione o di non-azione non dovrebbero essere frutto di sentimenti ideologici, ma richiedere approfondimenti senza pregiudizi rivolti ad una totale trasparenza dei risultati scientifici acquisiti a vantaggio dei cittadini, delle imprese e per il futuro stesso del nostro Paese.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5351276993751526, 0.4648723304271698]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, per la mia esperienza, avendo ricoperto l'incarico di Questore alla Camera per alcune legislature, vorrei puntualizzare alcuni aspetti che riguardano le norme che regolano l'assegno vitalizio, che oggi non è più assegno vitalizio per alcuni provvedimenti assunti sia in questo ramo del Parlamento che nell'altro. <p> Voglio dire agli amici del <PARTY>, i cui interventi ho sempre seguito con molta attenzione e con molto interesse, che bisogna conoscere alcune cose per dare dei giudizi con la massima obiettività. <p> La materia di cui ha parlato il senatore Sposetti è stata più volte riformata, fino all'abolizione dell'istituto del vitalizio (perché anche questo bisogna puntualizzare) con una delibera assunta il 1° gennaio 2012.

Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, rappresentante del Governo, ci accingiamo ad esprimere il nostro voto su uno degli ultimi provvedimenti di iniziativa del Governo Letta, serenamente messo alla porta dal suo successore attraverso l'ennesimo avvicendamento non legittimato dal voto popolare. L'avvento del Governo Renzi è stato giustificato dalla necessità di cambiare verso e cambiare passo, con esiti miracolosi dall'aria di una svolta buona. Tuttavia, con il trascorrere del tempo e avendo modo di verificare gli scarsi risultati, non possiamo non dire che, al di là degli aggettivi e degli epiteti che riecheggiano lo slogan che leggiamo nelle nostre autostrade «Sei in un Paese meraviglioso», questo Governo è molto lontano, se non addirittura incapace di guidare l'Italia nella direzione della crescita, dello sviluppo e dell'occupazione. Studiare e leggere con dovizia questo disegno di legge non fa che mettere a nudo due aspetti importanti: anzitutto, il Governo Renzi prosegue senza alcun apporto innovativo ciò che il Governo precedente ha iniziato. In secondo luogo, si ritrovano in tutte le attività del Governo e della maggioranza parlamentare la stessa identica impostazione e lo stesso metodo di tutti i Governi di sinistra che hanno occupato il banco dell'Esecutivo. L'impianto di questo provvedimento, come peraltro di altri identici, rimane di stampo dirigista: lo Stato, attraverso le sue emanazioni competenti, regola ogni dettaglio della vita dei singoli, delle famiglie e delle imprese e, nel caso di specie, arriva persino a classificare e a definire le passate di pomodoro. È chiaro che, così facendo, il risultato non sarà quello di incrementare la competitività del settore agricolo. Ancora una volta, è sbagliata la ratio che sta a fondamento delle misure adottate. Se l'attenzione è posta su ciò che il pubblico può e deve fare, si svilisce il privato, che nel frattempo cerca di fare scelte razionali per proseguire con la sua attività imprenditoriale, a mero spettatore passivo cui vengono fatte delle richieste illogiche e, soprattutto, controproducenti. Una fra tutte, la più lampante perché la più insensata a mio giudizio, si rintraccia nell'articolo 13, dove è sancito l'obbligo, da parte delle amministrazioni pubbliche, di acquisire in via telematica i dati relativi a soggetti che esercitano attività agricola. Ma voi immaginate un imprenditore agricolo delle campagne di un piccolo paese italiano dove non arriva, se non a chissà quanti chilometri di distanza, la linea Internet? Non ci rendiamo conto che l'ipertrofia normativa, soprattutto se concepita contro la natura delle cose, contribuisce alla perdita di competitività e non certo a un suo miglioramento? Si prevede poi che gli interventi finanziari a sostegno delle imprese agricole e della pesca avvengano attraverso operazioni finanziarie effettuate dall'Istituto per lo sviluppo agroalimentare SpA, sulla base di specifiche condizioni che tralascio in questa sede; ma l'intero meccanismo è subordinato alla preventiva autorizzazione della Commissione europea. Dunque alla nostra burocrazia aggiungiamo anche quella europea; così è sicuro che questa struttura di mutui agevolati non darà alcun vantaggio all'economia del settore. Invece, con l'intento di dare un reale sostegno, avevamo proposto l'esonero dagli adempimenti IVA per i piccoli produttori agricoli. Inoltre, nelle disposizioni in materia di pesca e acquacoltura si prevedono vincoli eccessivi per gli operatori, tra cui l'utilizzo di cassette standard per semplificare - si legge - le operazioni relative alla pesatura e l'utilizzo del codice a barre per fornire le informazioni relative ai prodotti. Invece di semplificare, si inseriscono ulteriori procedure per l'autorizzazione e la vendita dei prodotti della pesca e dell'acquacoltura. A riguardo, uno dei nostri emendamenti a mia firma era volto a rendere più agevole, piuttosto che ostacolare, il commercio dei prodotti relativi alla pesca, proponendo la vendita diretta di tali prodotti, peraltro in linea con le previsioni del disegno di legge che consentono la vendita diretta dei prodotti agricoli. Infine, gran parte delle disposizioni del disegno di legge comprende delle deleghe al Governo, per cui bisognerà attendere i decreti attuativi per la verifica dei risultati raggiunti. Per queste ragioni, a nome del Gruppo Forza Italia dichiaro il voto contrario a questo provvedimento.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5508987307548523, 0.4491012990474701]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente del Consiglio, l'abbiamo ascoltata con molto interesse e l'avremmo voluta qui anche un mese fa, in occasione del Consiglio europeo precedente, in cui pure si parlava di piano vaccinale. La nostro proposta, purtroppo, non è stata accettata e ci auguriamo che invece diventi prassi istituzionale venire in Parlamento e coinvolgerlo in occasione dei Consigli europei, anche per dare un segno di discontinuità rispetto all'Esecutivo precedente, che con molti atti lo ha svuotato progressivamente di alcune competenze e prerogative. È passato un mese da quel Consiglio europeo ad oggi, sono accadute cose senza precedenti e, signor Presidente, è tempo di andare oltre. <p> Signor Presidente del Consiglio,<PARTY> le chiede di alzare la voce in Europa e di farlo nella gestione dei vaccini. Lei deve dire con chiarezza, perché può farlo, che l'impatto delle varianti ha trovato i Paesi europei impreparati, nonostante si conoscesse da tempo il tasso di contagiosità. In questo clima di impreparazione, è stato un cortocircuito la campagna di profilassi ritardata, che ha rivelato il totale e clamoroso fallimento dell'Unione europea nel piano vaccinale. L'Unione europea ha sottoscritto contratti capestro con le aziende farmaceutiche, che non hanno rispettato i tempi e i numeri delle dosi da consegnare e, grazie a quei vincoli assurdi, sottoscritti da Bruxelles, quelle stesse case farmaceutiche sono rimaste sostanzialmente impunite rispetto alle loro inadempienze. Su questo fallimento, come un ciclone, è arrivata la questione relativa ad AstraZeneca del 10 marzo: quello appena trascorso è stato quindi un mese molto denso. <p> Signor Presidente, lei può e deve dunque dire all'Europa che ha enormi responsabilità nella cattiva gestione dei piani vaccinali e deve farlo, perché l'Europa sta pagando un prezzo altissimo alla pandemia. Il numero delle vittime ha già superato la cifra di un milione: si tratta del 35,5 per cento del totale dei decessi del pianeta. Nella sua ultima conferenza stampa, in occasione del decreto-legge sostegni, ha evocato un concetto ispirato al pragmatismo anche riguardo all' export dei vaccini da parte delle case farmaceutiche inadempienti. Ha anche detto di più: se il coordinamento dell'Unione europea non funziona, faremo in altro modo; e, se l'UE non autorizza presto, potremo farlo noi. Ha fatto quasi lasciar intendere che si possa aprire alla valutazione dello Sputnik. Questo pragmatismo e l'autonomia decisionale, che oggi ha chiamato autonomia strategica, vanno bene: lo faccia e ci troverà d'accordo. Se lo Sputnik è un vaccino sicuro ed efficace, non c'è guerra commerciale che tenga. Va valutato e messo in commercio subito, così come va valutato qualsiasi altro vaccino ritenuto potenzialmente utile al contrasto del Covid. Se il siero prodotto dagli scienziati di Mosca, signor Presidente, può aiutare a vincere la pandemia, l'Unione europea non può rifiutare un altro potenziale rimedio. Non ce lo possiamo permettere soltanto per un pregiudizio geopolitico, perché devono essere prevalenti l'interesse della salute e l'interesse scientifico. Se il commissario Breton dice - come ha fatto oggi - che non serve, lei può agevolmente dire il contrario. Insomma, signor Presidente, uso le parole di Giorgia Meloni nel dire che il Governo italiano si deve svegliare dal torpore e agire nell'esclusivo interesse nazionale, intervenendo in sede europea e, se necessario, andando avanti per la propria strada. Basta ritardi e guerre commerciali. Basta perdere un tempo che non c'è, mentre il virus accelera e si modifica! Serve una radicale inversione di rotta. Vengo ora al piano vaccinale. Lei oggi afferma che vaccineremo quante più persone possibili nel più breve tempo possibile. Nulla da dire: è condivisibile. Il punto, però, sono i numeri. Se il ritmo è quello di oggi, ovvero 158.000 dosi, per raggiungere il 70 per cento degli italiani occorre oltre un anno. E questo non lo dico io. Non può rimanere questo il ritmo. Quando lei dice, ottimisticamente forse, che ci potrebbero essere due mesi di ritardo, devo pensare che ogni giorno di ritardo può significare 500 persone che muoiono. Se devo moltiplicare questa cifra per due mesi, significa che possono morire 30.000 persone. E non voglio fare altri conti, perché non sono numeri, ma sono persone e la responsabilità è enorme. Qual è il piano, allora? 500.000 iniezioni al giorno ad aprile e 700.000 a maggio? Bene: bisogna arrivarci. Bisogna arrivarci ed essere pronti. Il piano predisposto dal generale Figliuolo può funzionare come macchina, ma solo se ci saranno le dosi necessarie e se ci sarà la platea per somministrarle, altrimenti fallirà tutto. Bisogna mettere a punto tante cose, di cui sentiamo parlare ma che non vediamo messe a sistema. La campagna vaccinale lanciata il 27 dicembre è poi fallita. Su questo lei non ha le responsabilità dirette e personali, ovviamente, ma sa che ciò rientra nella fallimentare politica sanitaria messa in atto dall'Esecutivo precedente, che vede nel ministro Speranza il segno di una sinistra continuità, mentre è di radicale discontinuità che, anche su questo, l'Italia ha bisogno. Ancora: ha chiesto alle Regioni un riallineamento. È giusto ma, se mancano indicazioni precise a livello centrale, è difficile richiamare le Regioni. Come mai abbiamo il paradosso per il quale vediamo che la popolazione over 80 è stata vaccinata neppure per il 30 per cento del suo totale, quando ormai è chiaro che il virus colpisce per l'86 per cento persone di fascia anziana. È un paradosso inspiegabile, presidente Draghi. Ancora, la campagna vaccinale è partita secondo alcune categorie, mentre adesso, invece, per fasce d'età: confusione e ritardi. E soprattutto, avete dimenticato, nelle fasi 1 e 2, le categorie dei disabili, dei fragili, i caregiver e i loro familiari. Oggi - per fortuna - ve ne ricordate, e anche grazie a un emendamento di <PARTY>. Nulla potrà giustificare il caos che abbiamo visto. Nulla potrà giustificare anziani in fila, assembrati e magari portati con gli autobus. Nulla potrà giustificare il ritardo nelle assistenze domiciliari e il ritardo di protocolli non aggiornati da parte del Ministero. Davvero nulla. Noi non abbiamo solo criticato: abbiamo fatto un piano vaccinale. Tra l'altro, alcune proposte le vediamo inserite e ne siamo contenti. Questo è un caso in cui ci va bene anche solo il fatto di partecipare. Il nostro piano vaccinale prevedeva assistenza domiciliare, allargamento della platea dei vaccinatori, coinvolgendo medici di base e farmacisti. Anche sui farmacisti, però, dovete sbrigarvi a fare i protocolli, altrimenti non riuscirete a mettere a punto questo sistema. Vede, presidente Draghi, il punto è anche che, su tutta la strategia di contenimento della pandemia, non vediamo segni di importante discontinuità, perché siamo ancora qui con la DAD, con le scuole chiuse, con i ristoranti chiusi, con i vaccini che non arrivano. Mi avvio alla conclusione, perché mi rendo conto che il mio tempo è finito. Mi piacerebbe parlarne del reshoring farmaceutico, ma lo farò la prossima volta. Presidente Draghi, il punto è sempre uno ed è sempre quello: quale postura avere stando in Europa. Noi continuiamo a pensare che sia necessario difendere, in Europa, l'interesse nazionale e considerarlo preminente. Non potremo mai accettare alcuna cessione di sovranità nazionale, come lei ha detto anche nelle sue comunicazioni il giorno del voto di fiducia. Presidente, questo è il momento in cui bisogna essere assertivi e non si può cedere su nulla. Lei guarda l'Europa, oggi, da un'altra posizione. Il suo compito e il suo dovere, oggi, è pensare solo e soltanto all'Italia e agli italiani.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5802090764045715, 0.4197908937931061]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> ZAFFINI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, do anzitutto il benvenuto al signor Ministro, che accogliamo in quest'Aula in occasione del primo provvedimento in materia di sanità, dopo quasi un anno dal suo insediamento. Si tratta di un provvedimento di cui si apprezza sicuramente lo sforzo, ma decisamente non il risultato. Ieri, con un'espressione un po' colorita, ho detto che il provvedimento sarebbe da ribattezzare «Calabria Saudita», perché prende in considerazione un pezzo di Paese che sembra non esistere come Italia e non esserci per tanti motivi. In primo luogo, dopo dieci anni di gestione commissariale, con risultati a dir poco disastrosi (di cui, evidentemente, non è assolutamente responsabile lei, né l'attuale Governo), mettiamo mano a delle soluzioni che non cambiano nulla rispetto all'impianto economicistico, come lo definirebbe il collega Errani, ma, anzi, in un combinato disposto micidiale, aggiungono una visione criminalistica. Infatti, viene stabilito che non basta più un commissario, ma ne occorrono due, e che servono i controllori dei controllori dei controllori. Si tratta di norme che - non è difficile da immaginare - complicheranno ulteriormente un impianto che non ha risolto minimamente il problema dei conti, ma - anzi - li ha aggravati e, soprattutto, ha determinato un gap di oltre cinque anni nell'aspettativa di vita (di cui lei, signor Ministro, è perfettamente a conoscenza). A quarant'anni dal varo del Servizio sanitario nazionale e a dieci anni dal primo commissariamento di una Regione dello Stato italiano, come la Calabria, ancora non risolviamo il problema e condanniamo i cittadini calabresi a un deficit di cinque anni nell'aspettativa di vita. Questo non è da nazione civile, da Italia. Ripeto, è da «Calabria Saudita». Tutto questo non poteva essere affrontato in un provvedimento così superficiale e, come l'ho definito ieri, leggiadro. Tutto ciò è sconcertante, signor Ministro. Si agisce con quindici articoli su temi che rappresentano, di fatto, quattro riforme. Infatti, è di quattro riforme che parliamo: il sistema di commissariamento della Calabria; le professioni medico-sanitarie; l'Agenzia italiana del farmaco; alcuni provvedimenti che riguardano le procedure giudiziarie e contabili. Con una manciata di articoli rimettiamo mano al problema in un modo che - lo ripeto - è ampiamente preoccupante, quasi sconcertante, senza agire sulle cause, ma solo con un'aspirina che cura gli effetti. Ad esempio, sulla vicenda delle professioni mediche, partendo dall'analisi, che ormai è ampiamente condivisa, della carenza di medici specialisti, ma non solo, perché mancano anche figure professionali mediche di secondo livello, tre sono i livelli di emergenza. Il primo è quello dell'accesso all'università, il secondo è quello della disponibilità di medici specializzati, il terzo è l'esigenza di rendere meglio disponibile e più razionalmente utilizzato l'attuale personale. Lei agisce sul terzo livello, ma lo fa secondo una logica sbrigativa ed anche preoccupante per certi aspetti, mi riferisco ad esempio ai medici dell'emergenza-urgenza e ai medici di medicina generale. Agisce così, a strappo, senza prevedere, senza preordinare soluzioni che mettano mano alle cause. Abbiamo fatto l'esempio delle borse di studio: la relatrice ha illustrato la disponibilità di un numero aggiuntivo di borse di studio, ma qui serve una rivoluzione, Ministro. Presidente Sileri, non mi distragga il Ministro, perché non c'è mai in Aula, quindi oggi la voglio tutta per me. Serve qualcosa di rivoluzionario, serve una visione. Io rispetto al collega Errani sono stato per una vita intera dall'altra parte e ho un imbarazzo totale nel dover condividere quello che lui dice, ma serve una visione, Ministro. Oggi lei, non avendo alcuna responsabilità rispetto a quanto è successo nella Regione Calabria, né rispetto a quanto accade nel Servizio sanitario nazionale in genere, ha la grande opportunità, che costituisce anche un obbligo, di avere una visione, di rivoluzionare un impianto che non funziona più, di dare segnali importanti. Sulla disponibilità delle scuole di specializzazione, ad esempio, come ho detto ieri, perché non dare la possibilità alle multinazionali farmaceutiche, alle quali abbiamo appaltato la ricerca - che è una cosa ben più grave - di pagare un certo numero di borse di studio per la formazione dei medici specialistici? Perché no? Qual è il problema? Se il problema è il denaro, perché non aprire a queste nuove forme di collaborazione? Molto altro ci sarebbe da valutare. Che dire, quindi, Ministro? Abbiamo finalmente affrontato il tema, ma lo affrontiamo per diciotto mesi, cioè a tempo determinato e solo nella parte che riguarda gli effetti e con alcuni provvedimenti palliativi, quindi siamo fortemente preoccupati perché riteniamo che in realtà questa visione non ci sia. Riteniamo che in realtà prevalga la logica dell'amministratore di condominio rispetto alla logica di chi governa un fenomeno: oggi c'è bisogno di tutto nella sanità tranne che di un amministratore di condominio. Vede, Ministro, quest'anno celebriamo i quarant'anni del Servizio sanitario nazionale. Lei sa meglio di me, perché dispone di dati confidenziali, che questo sistema così com'è è all'ultimo giro, è suonata la campanella, non reggerà oltre i prossimi due, tre o quattro anni. Forse festeggeremo il quarantaduesimo o il quarantatreesimo anniversario, ma non celebreremo certamente i quarantacinque o i cinquant'anni anni del Servizio sanitario nazionale così com'è. Si impone allora, per tutta una serie di motivi, si badi bene, anche esterni al Servizio sanitario nazionale (la società che evolve, la cronicizzazione delle malattie, l'allungamento della vita media), un'esigenza rispetto alla quale lei, Ministro, ha una grande responsabilità, che è quella di prefigurare fin da ora un'apertura, una visione. Ribadisco, ad esempio, che va strutturato il secondo pilastro. Lo hanno fatto tutte le economie avanzate, in Europa lo hanno fatto la Francia e il Regno Unito. Noi siamo fortemente in ritardo. Io paragono l'idiosincrasia nei confronti del privato con la vecchia diatriba padrone-operaio. Basta, superiamo questi blocchi mentali. Apriamo a un servizio sanitario nuovo e cominciamo da questi provvedimenti a dare l'immagine di una visione, se c'è. Ma io ho il ragionevole sospetto che non ci sia: se c'è, signor Ministro, ce la mostri e ce la faccia vedere. In questo provvedimento la visione non c'è e non c'è neanche la soluzione dei problemi della Regione Calabria. Riteniamo anche che ci siano gravi ed importanti profili di incostituzionalità e non a caso abbiamo votato a favore di entrambe le pregiudiziali.

Credo che, anche in virtù della recente sentenza della Corte costituzionale, sia opportuno riflettere sull'indirizzo che l'Assemblea deve dare, all'interno di un provvedimento, che - ahimè - già per altre fattispecie provocherà parecchi danni. Con questo decreto-legge, e in modo particolare con l'articolo 2, non stiamo dando sicuramente un buon esempio alle giovani generazioni. Stiamo invitando le giovani generazioni ad intraprendere delle strade che sicuramente causeranno problemi al complesso della nostra società. Io ritengo che, per prevenire determinati fenomeni, non sia questa la strada da seguire: la prevenzione deve cercare di sostenere tutte le iniziative che vanno nella direzione di reprimere quei fenomeni che, come lo spaccio di droga, ledono il tessuto sociale delle nostre comunità. Lo dico anche perché conosciamo tutti l'impegno che mettono le Forze dell'ordine, quotidianamente, nel cercare di reprimere questi reati, nel perseguirne gli autori, anche alla luce del business che la criminalità internazionale realizza sulla pelle dei nostri giovani e di tutte le componenti della società. Pertanto, se all'interno di questo provvedimento da noi non condiviso vi è proprio una fattispecie che viene regolamentata a nostro giudizio in modo sbagliato, è proprio quella recata dall'articolo 2, per il suo messaggio culturale, etico e morale. Mi riferisco al fatto che si possa accettare e liberalizzare tutto. Sostanzialmente ci si arrende di fronte ad una realtà che, al contrario, andrebbe combattuta nei modi giusti. Io non penso che possano servire solo le politiche di repressione, quelle dure e rigide, ma sicuramente non serve nemmeno una politica lassista, una sorta di laissez-faire. Questo non è accettabile, perché credo che si passi dal sogno della sinistra della fantasia al potere all'ipocrisia del potere che accetta tutto pur di dare dei segnali che magari vanno incontro a una parte dell'elettorato, ma non portano a costituire una società sana per il nostro futuro.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5690892934799194, 0.43091070652008057]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> BORIOLI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, voglio rivolgere ai colleghi poche parole per raccontare una piccola storia che si sta svolgendo nell'ambito del mio collegio e che racconta una grande sofferenza. È la storia di una bambina di sei anni che, dopo pochissimo tempo dalla nascita, è stata sottratta alla cura dei genitori, affidata ai servizi sociali e poi alle cure di una famiglia. Nel frattempo, nei confronti dei suoi genitori naturali, a ragione della loro età anagrafica - un'età effettivamente avanzata in maniera inconsueta rispetto a quella in cui normalmente si concepiscono i figli e a causa della quale, nel 2010, quando la bimba nacque, si scatenò anche una particolare attenzione mediatica - i tribunali (prima la Corte d'appello di Torino e poi la Corte di cassazione) avevano emesso un provvedimento che sottraeva definitivamente questa bimba alle cure dei propri genitori naturali, dichiarandone l'adottabilità. Ciò che colpisce è che, alla base di queste sentenze c'era la presunzione di un atto di abbandono da parte dei genitori stessi nei confronti della bimba. Ebbene, nonostante successivamente sia intervenuta, su questa presunzione di abbandono, una sentenza della Corte d'appello di Torino, che invece scagionava completamente i genitori da questa ipotesi di reato, la Corte di cassazione, nel 2013, ha ribadito nei confronti di questa famiglia l'inaffidabilità a svolgere il proprio compito genitoriale e ha decretato nuovamente l'adottabilità della bambina. Attraverso un'istanza di revoca, la settimana scorsa la stessa Corte di cassazione ha determinato invece che l'adottabilità non può essere sentenziata e che quella bambina, anche alla luce delle verifiche ulteriormente fatte sulle caratteristiche sociali, culturali, morali dei genitori, può essere riaffidata alle cure della famiglia stessa, rimandando la sentenza adottata dalla stessa Corte di cassazione all'esame della Corte d'appello di Torino. Naturalmente io non ho né gli strumenti giuridici né quelli di formazione psicologica o sociologica per esprimere una valutazione compiuta nel merito. Certamente, in questa vicenda lasciano sconcertati ed esterrefatti molti elementi di discrepanza e addirittura di palese antinomia tra la prima sentenza della Corte di cassazione - che, a proposito di questi genitori, parlò di totale inaffidabilità e di presunzione di onnipotenza per avere scelto di avere una bimba nonostante l'età avanzata - e la sentenza di oggi, che invece dice che quei genitori sono persone perbene e assolutamente adatte a svolgere il loro compito genitoriale. PRESIDENTE. Senatore, la prego di concludere. BORIOLI (<PARTY>). Ci troviamo di fronte - lo dico nella maniera più pacata possibile - ad un dissidio tra norme, interpretazione delle stesse e valutazione delle condizioni sociali e psicologiche di una famiglia di fronte al proprio diritto di esercitare la genitorialità e al diritto del bimbo di avere una famiglia in cui essere accudito. Queste distonie della giurisprudenza producono un danno, prima di tutto nei confronti di un minore, che comunque oggi ha sei anni e per sei anni non ha potuto avere una famiglia. Quindi, mi auguro che questo ci possa fare da lezione.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5230523347854614, 0.4769476652145386]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> MANASSERO (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, signori del Governo, la Lega voterà sì e quindi, premendo il tasto verde, approverà questo lavoro, che nel 2018 era stato promosso anche dall'allora ministro dell'interno Matteo Salvini. Già dal titolo si intuiva infatti quali avrebbero dovuto essere gli obiettivi della Lega e di quel Governo di questa legislatura, ossia: «Disposizioni in materia di sicurezza per gli esercenti le professioni sanitarie e socio-sanitarie nell'esercizio delle loro funzioni». Si sa che le dinamiche cambiano. Dopo i risvolti degli ultimi mesi, c'è da chiedersi - legittimamente - se per voi sia chiaro il concetto semantico racchiuso nella parola «sicurezza». Il disegno di legge in esame doveva essere il punto di partenza, non quello di arrivo. <p> Doveva rappresentare la volontà concreta e consapevole di tutela del personale sanitario e socio-sanitario. Ma siete veramente convinti che promuovere le buone prassi e istituire un osservatorio sia veramente sufficiente a proteggere medici, infermieri, operatori sanitari e tutta la filiera sul campo? No, signori, non è sufficiente starsene seduti in un ufficio in compagnia di rappresentanti di organizzazioni sindacali e di categoria e delle Regioni, di un rappresentante dell'Agenzia nazionale per i servizi sanitari regionali, e di rappresentanti dei Ministeri dell'interno, della difesa, della giustizia, del lavoro e delle politiche sociali, degli ordini professionali interessati, delle organizzazioni di settore e delle associazioni di pazienti. Durante l'esame in seconda lettura alla Camera dei deputati avete inserito anche l'INPS: con l'aggiunta di un paio di task force avremmo potuto dire che sareste state delle personcine veramente coerenti! <p> L'articolo 8 del provvedimento istituisce la Giornata nazionale di educazione e prevenzione contro la violenza nei confronti degli operatori sanitari e socio-sanitari. Bello! Ma secondo voi una giornata sul calendario è un aiuto concreto per chi si prende schiaffi, sputi, coltellate, stupri e spari? Parlo naturalmente dei Pronto soccorso e dei centri di salute mentale, che oggi sono ancora un tabù di cui nessuno ha iniziato a parlare. <p> Questo Governo ha una strana maniera di intendere la sicurezza con il provvedimento in esame: da una parte, ad aggressione avvenuta e crimine commesso, si tutela obbligando le aziende sanitarie a costituirsi parte civile; dall'altra, si respingono però gli emendamenti che richiedevano la videosorveglianza e un presidio fisso di polizia, anche con un solo agente, non tanto per essere pronti a intervenire in caso di emergenza, ma per fungere da dissuasore. Questa è prevenzione. <p> Queste richieste della Lega sono state invece bocciate sia alla Camera dei deputati, che al Senato (si tratta di emendamenti che io stessa avevo presentato), perché comportano oneri finanziari. Ma come, con tre scostamenti di bilancio per 100 miliardi di euro, nessuno ha pensato di rivedere la propria posizione a favore e doverosa tutela del personale sanitario e socio-sanitario? Non vi sarebbe caduta la corona di latta. Eppure, sono già stati stanziati 30 milioni di euro per anno, dal 2020 al 2024. <p> Sembrerebbe che, per voi, la priorità siano gli osservatori, le buone prassi, le giornate del ricordo e la promozione dell'informazione.

Signor Presidente, signor Ministro, la questione dei divari territoriali di sviluppo economico ha segnato la storia economica del nostro Paese fin dall'Unità. La loro riduzione è stata costantemente al centro dell'agenda della politica economica, fino ad assumere anche una dimensione europea. Ricordiamo, infatti, che nel preambolo al Trattato di Roma del 1957 si proclama che gli Stati membri sono «solleciti di rafforzare l'unità delle loro economie e di assicurarne lo sviluppo armonioso riducendo le disparità fra le differenti regioni...». È vero che in un ambiente economicamente poco sviluppato come il nostro, senza adeguato sostegno pubblico, non sempre si avviano processi di convergenza spontanei e i divari possono, quindi, perpetuarsi. Il prolungarsi della crisi ha portato proprio ad un ulteriore allargamento del divario di sviluppo dell'economia del Mezzogiorno con il Centro-Nord; non dimentichiamo però che anche le Regioni del Centro-Nord hanno subito un forte rallentamento della crescita, proprio in conseguenza della crisi che stiamo vivendo. Tra gli interventi messi in campo per il sostegno alla crescita, i contratti di sviluppo rappresentano lo strumento a supporto degli investimenti privati, per favorire la realizzazione di progetti di sviluppo rilevanti per il Paese, con particolare riferimento alle aree del Mezzogiorno. La disciplina dei criteri e delle modalità di concessione delle agevolazioni finanziarie è stata introdotta con il decreto interministeriale del 24 settembre 2010, e la recente legge 9 agosto 2013, n. 98, ha previsto un rifinanziamento di 150 milioni di euro a favore dei contratti di sviluppo. Ciò premesso, le chiedo, signor Ministro, se ritiene che tali investimenti indotti con denaro pubblico riescano a produrre benessere duraturo nei territori in questione, quali sono le Regioni maggiormente beneficiarie di questi interventi e quali i progetti finora finanziati e le risorse assegnate a ciascuno.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5912231206893921, 0.4087768793106079]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, esprimo parere contrario sugli emendamenti 15.200 e 15.3, sui quali la 5ᵃ Commissione permanente ha espresso parere contrario.

Colleghi, ci rendiamo conto del punto a cui siamo arrivati? Stiamo facendo in Senato, nel bel mezzo della discussione generale, un dibattito tecnico che andava svolto in Commissione, perché è in quella sede che si affrontano questi problemi, ma voi non ce l'avete consentito. <p> Colleghi, questo non è più accettabile.

Signor Presidente, approfitto di questa occasione per stigmatizzare un evento che ancora una volta lascia molto stupefatti, per così dire. Ho avuto più volte occasione di ribadire in quest'Aula come spesso la filosofia dei tagli lineari faccia veramente dei disastri molto più gravi di quei problemi che vorrebbe risolvere. Faccio riferimento al tribunale di Modica, della cui chiusura ho cercato di coinvolgere molti dei nostri senatori, che insieme a me sono venuti nella città di Modica per vedere cosa si sta compiendo con quest'atto diretto a chiudere un tribunale che è stato inaugurato pochi anni fa e che è costato soltanto 12 milioni di euro. Tutto questo per risparmiare e concentrare l'attività giudiziaria nel vicino capoluogo, la città di Ragusa. Ebbene, adesso (ed è per questo che intervengo, perché io ho sollecitato la Commissione giustizia, ho presentato interrogazioni, i colleghi sono venuti a Modica e si sono resi conto della qualità e dell'efficienza sotto tutti i punti di vista di una struttura nuova e sicura) dalla città capoluogo, che dovrebbe accogliere il proprio tribunale e quello della vicina città di Modica, si chiedono al Ministero competente dei fondi, dei soldi per poter rendere una struttura adeguata ad accogliere il tribunale di Ragusa e quello di Modica. Pertanto vorrei chiedere all'Assemblea (e naturalmente al Governo, che purtroppo non è presente, ma presenterò un'interrogazione domattina) qual è la ratio, dove sta il risparmio. Chiudiamo un tribunale che abbiamo appena inaugurato, costato 12 milioni di euro, e chiediamo altri fondi al Ministero per andare a rinforzare delle strutture che naturalmente non possono essere adeguate per accogliere tutto il lavoro che riguarda entrambi i tribunali. Tutto questo comporta un aumento di spesa, un disservizio, un procrastinare ancora negli anni le risposte che già sono molto lente, purtroppo.

Benché il provvedimento sia denominato appunto milleproroghe, esso non contiene solo proroghe di termini perché non si sono fatti i compiti, ma vengono decise anche misure utili per i cittadini, come la proroga di 120 giorni per chi ha avuto uno sfratto; il posticipo della fissazione dei criteri per utilizzare il CAF in modo adeguato; l'introduzione di differimenti di termini per la presentazione della domanda all'INPS, con riferimento in particolare alla fattispecie della disciplina relativa ai trattamenti pensionistici per i lavoratori esposti all'amianto: questi sono provvedimenti che i cittadini aspettano, non è il Governo che vuole imporre una sua tabella di marcia. <p> Ci sono provvedimenti sulle emergenze e noi sappiamo che i problemi dell'Emilia-Romagna e dell'Aquila sono ancora aperti e richiedono ulteriori proroghe per gli atti che li riguardano. <p> Ci sono anche interventi sul lavoro, incentivi fiscali finalizzati al rientro del lavoratore in Italia, ad esempio, o disposizioni in materia di regime fiscale per l'imprenditoria giovanile e i lavoratori in mobilità: questi sicuramente sono provvedimenti e proroghe attesi. <p> C'è poi tutta la partita relativa ai rapporti tra Stato, enti locali, Province e Regioni: in questi anni di grandi trasformazioni, sicuramente ci sono state delle pecche anche da parte nostra, con difficoltà ed ingorghi organizzativi, ma certamente gli enti locali stanno ancora aspettando molti provvedimenti. Per citarne uno fra quelli più importanti per il momento che stiamo vivendo, vi è la proroga al 2017 della compartecipazione al 100 per cento del contrasto all'evasione per i Comuni: è un punto importante che è stato richiesto proprio perché le attività di contrasto all'evasione abbiano maggiore efficacia. <p> Un altro elemento importante è la proroga sulle centrali uniche di committenza. I Comuni, soprattutto quelli più piccoli (perché questa misura riguarda i Comuni non capoluogo di Provincia), hanno chiesto innanzitutto una scadenza unica, perché erano previste due scadenze diverse, una per l'acquisizione di beni e servizi e un'altra per lavori pubblici: la scadenza è stata unificata al 1° settembre 2015, aiutando prevalentemente i Comuni più piccoli, perché non sono riusciti in questi mesi ad adeguarsi a questa normativa e soprattutto ad unirsi, rispetto a tutti i problemi organizzativi, dando vita alle forme associate di Comuni. <p> Gli interventi sulle Regioni, che sono nuovamente, in questo periodo, oggetto di molti problemi, riguardano anche il patto di stabilità verticale, che come sapete consente agli enti locali di usufruire di un pezzo del Patto di stabilità della Regione. <p> Infine, le Province, che come sappiamo sono un tasto dolente in questo momento: molte sono le difficoltà che affrontano e tutti attendevano, ad esempio, una parola sui centri per l'impiego. Il fatto di avere una proroga sui centri per l'impiego diventa fondamentale. <p> Faccio ancora due osservazioni. <p> Una riguarda i Giochi olimpici del 2006, su cui sono stata stimolata dai precedenti interventi. Mi spiace per la senatrice Fucksia, ma questa è una proroga assolutamente indispensabile al fine di non far perdere soldi a tutti coloro che in questo momento hanno un contenzioso aperto. Infatti, le residue attività dell'agenzia riguardano prevalentemente la definizione delle vertenze ancora pendenti che consentiranno poi di utilizzare le risorse residue. Risorse che ammontavano a circa 40 milioni di euro. <p> Questo consente altresì l'esecuzione di interventi di manutenzione straordinaria e riqualificazione degli impianti siti nei territori montani interessati dai Giochi. Questo può non saperlo solo chi non ha ben presente cosa abbia voluto dire la rivoluzione dei Giochi olimpici per certi territori montani piccoli, dove sono stati inseriti impianti di grandissima dimensione che hanno richiesto una attività di riconversione molto complessa. <p> Mi permetto, signor Presidente, di rivolgere una piccola battuta all'amica senatrice Comaroli, che si è lamentata moltissimo delle proroghe. E in parte io condivido la sua irritazione perché anche penso che i decreti milleproroghe debbano essere negli anni smaltiti e rimpiccioliti nelle loro dimensioni. Mi chiedo, però, come mai ella non si sia lamentata dell'articolo 4, comma 3, che prevede la proroga dell'utilizzo di risorse disponibili sulla contabilità speciale delle Province di Monza e della Brianza, che sono destinate alla costituzione degli uffici periferici dell'amministrazione dello Stato, risorse assegnate alla contabilità speciale istituita presso il Commissario di ciascuna Provincia e poi trasferite ai prefetti incaricati di completare gli interventi.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.691163957118988, 0.30883604288101196]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, signor Presidente del Consiglio, Governo, confesso una reale emozione anche perché la sua autorevolezza e competenza mettono in soggezione.

Con 400 miliardi in meno di fatturato, un calo del <PARTY>L pari a circa il 9 per cento, la semplificazione e il taglio della burocrazia sono fondamentali per la ripresa.

Credo che ormai sia chiaro a tutti. Il rischio che abbiamo corso - spero di poter parlare al passato - è quello che il 50 per cento delle tratte aeree dirette verso l'Italia con questo coprifuoco venga dirottato altrove per evidenti motivi. Dover andare a casa alle ore 22, mentre in altri Paesi puoi godere ancora dell'estate, non ci aiuta. Se la paura dell'assembramento post ore 22 per bar e ristoranti è un problema e dà preoccupazione, le do una notizia: signor Presidente, oggi ho fatto Genova-Roma in un aereo pieno e senza distanziamento. <p> Alla proposta di qualcuno che vuole lanciare la moda di prendere il sole con la mascherina, rispondo provocatoriamente: facciamo jogging con la tuta da sci. A proposito del superbonus, tutti chiedono una proroga al 2023. Al contempo, ci preoccupano non poco le condizionalità per arrivare a questa proroga. Signor Presidente, ha detto lei stesso che con il combinato disposto tra proroga con condizionalità e assenza delle semplificazioni, che abbiamo chiesto e fatto inserire nel recovery, si rischia il blocco del settore. Sulla semplificazione ci giochiamo l'efficacia di questa misura. Non ci piove. La messa a terra di questa misura passa attraverso la semplificazione e ovviamente nel 2023 rischiamo il blocco degli investimenti da questo punto di vista. <p> Signor Presidente, mi preme richiamare la sua attenzione su un tema a me caro, che abbiamo voluto inserire in modo trasversale. Non so se c'è il senatore Croatti - metto gli occhiali così lo vedo - che con me ha fatto una battaglia per le guide turistiche, che chiedono finalmente e per fortuna una riforma della loro situazione, anche perché sono, forse, coloro che hanno subito di più il momento difficile derivante da questa pandemia nel settore del turismo. Se vorrà cogliere questa sfida insieme al ministro Garavaglia, signor Presidente, noi ci saremo. Concludo perché il tempo non è molto. <p> Il recovery plan evidentemente non può essere la soluzione a tutti i problemi, soprattutto se non è accompagnato dalle riforme che tutti si aspettano. È però sicuramente una straordinaria opportunità. Nella riforma che l'Europa ci chiede relativamente alla parità di genere, diritti sociali e sostenibilità, l'Europa e soprattutto lei, signor Presidente, difendeteci da quei Paesi che fanno concorrenza al nostro Continente, che queste regole non le rispettano.

Signora Presidente, signor Ministro, signora Sottosegretaria, onorevoli colleghe, onorevoli colleghi, quello al nostro esame è un provvedimento che tutti attendevamo e forse, ingenuamente, speravamo di poter contribuire alla sua stesura. Purtroppo il Governo Gentiloni agisce in continuità con il precedente, azzerando il nostro lavoro nelle Commissioni competenti e bocciando tutti gli emendamenti presentati. Il Governo Gentiloni-Renzi e il partito di maggioranza hanno enfatizzato, nei giorni scorsi, l'introduzione in Italia di una misura di contrasto alla povertà. Si tratta del reddito di inclusione che, secondo le intenzioni della maggioranza, dovrebbe essere la misura risolutiva per affrontare questa condizione sociale. Le risorse messe a disposizione per rispondere alle difficoltà economiche di milioni di persone, che sono povere o a rischio di povertà, sono 600 milioni di euro per il primo anno e un miliardo di euro per il secondo anno (il 2017). Si tratta di cifre irrisorie e non comprendo come possano essere salutate come misura contro la povertà. Diversi sono stati i finanziamenti in favore delle banche e per proteggere chi si è reso responsabile dei disastri perpetrati sulle spalle di migliaia di risparmiatori: questa comparazione consente di stabilire in modo evidente dove effettivamente si rivolge la maggiore attenzione del Governo. Dunque, viene proposta l'ennesima legge delega: si tratta di una delega ampia, di una cambiale in bianco che, per essere attuata, necessita dell'adozione, entro sei mesi, di numerosi decreti legislativi per: l'introduzione di una misura nazionale di contrasto della povertà, intesa come impossibilità di disporre dell'insieme dei beni e dei servizi necessari a condurre un livello di vita dignitoso, e dell'esclusione sociale (tale misura, denominata reddito di inclusione, è individuata come livello essenziale delle prestazioni da garantire uniformemente in tutto il territorio nazionale); il riordino delle prestazioni di natura assistenziale, finalizzate al contrasto della povertà, fatta eccezione per le prestazioni rivolte alla popolazione anziana, non più in età di attivazione lavorativa, per le prestazioni a sostegno della genitorialità e per quelle legate alla condizione di disabilità e di invalidità del beneficiario; il rafforzamento del coordinamento degli interventi in materia di servizi sociali, al fine di garantire in tutto il territorio nazionale i livelli essenziali delle prestazioni, nell'ambito dei principi di cui alla legge 8 novembre 2000, n. 328. Per fortuna, è stato bloccato sul nascere il tentativo di mettere le mani sulle pensioni sociali e di reversibilità, ma - come detto precedentemente - questo è un Governo di Robin Hood al contrario: toglie ai poveri per dare ai banchieri. Stilare decreti legislativi è compito sicuramente non facile, ma spero che possa essere affrontato dal Governo con la dovuta attenzione, magari attingendo dai tanti interventi propositivi delle opposizioni enunciati in questi giorni in Commissione, come in Assemblea. Purtroppo, però vista l'accelerazione data al provvedimento nelle ultime settimane, temo che usciranno decreti legislativi molto simili a slide da campagna elettorale. Dall'inizio della crisi le persone in povertà assoluta in Italia sono aumentate del 155 per cento: nel 2007 erano 1,8 milioni, mentre oggi sono 4,6 milioni. Dietro ai numeri ci sono i volti e le storie di centinaia di migliaia di famiglie; a queste persone non siamo in grado di dare una risposta complessiva. Sono persone che hanno perso il lavoro o sono precipitate nel disagio per problemi legati alla ludopatia, alle droghe, agli alcolici o semplicemente per aver affrontato una separazione non consensuale; sono uomini e donne che ogni giorno lottano per ritrovare la propria dignità. Uno Stato degno di questo nome dovrebbe prendersi cura di questi italiani, ottemperando a ciò che la nostra Costituzione recita all'articolo 3. Per noi l'obiettivo è fornire risposte concrete alla povertà non con l'assistenzialismo, ma attraverso la creazione di opportunità di lavoro vero che possano contribuire allo sviluppo e alla crescita del nostro Paese. La legge delega non stanzia risorse ulteriori a sostegno delle misure indicate, oltre a quelle già previste dalla legge di stabilità. Eventuali ulteriori risorse dovranno essere reperite dalle amministrazioni competenti (dunque, Ministero del lavoro ed enti locali) attraverso una diversa allocazione delle ordinarie risorse umane, finanziarie e strumentali, allo stato di dotazione alle medesime amministrazioni. È notizia di qualche giorno fa che più del 22,3 per cento di entrate tributarie deriva dal boom degli incassi da giochi. Di fatto, si tratta di 2,5 miliardi di euro in più. Non potevano essere messi a disposizione di questo disegno di legge? Invece, ancora una volta, si chiedono sforzi agli enti locali dopo una stagione di tagli che non ha eguali nella storia della Repubblica. Che dire? Questa è una sinistra che ha abbandonato i sindacati, gli insegnanti, gli operai, i disabili che ha fortemente messo in difficoltà con la riforma dell'ISEE. Il provvedimento oggi in approvazione prevede equipe multidisciplinari che dovranno valutare domanda per domanda, persona per persona la platea dei richiedenti dei benefici concessi da questa legge. Faccio una stima: fra dieci anni ci saranno ancora utenti in attesa di valutazione. Non era forse meglio utilizzare i servizi sociali dei Comuni magari trasferendo a questo scopo risorse dedicate? Inoltre, chi farà i controlli sulle persone beneficiarie? Pensate veramente che chi vive il problema della ludopatia, della tossicodipendenza, dell'alcolismo andrà a cercarsi un lavoro e che il contributo che riceverà lo spenderà per nobili motivi? Attenzione, vorrei fugare ogni possibile dubbio: non siamo contrari alla istituzione di politiche di sostegno al reddito, ma avremmo voluto confrontarci avendo davanti qualcosa di concreto. Senatrice Parente, avremmo apprezzato una maggioranza capace di discutere, di confrontarsi, magari dandoci la possibilità di contribuire attivamente all'elaborazione del disegno di legge. La povertà è un problema di tutti. Colpisce in maniera trasversale. Non ci sono verità precostituite e, tanto meno, detentori della verità. Cari colleghi della maggioranza, fatevene una ragione: nessuno possiede la verità assoluta, tanto meno voi. Le cambiali in bianco non le firma quasi più nessuno; restano solamente i ricattati, i ricattabili e gli stolti a farlo. Ci troverete sempre pronti quando avrete l'umiltà, ma soprattutto il coraggio di confrontarvi sulle idee e non su dei fogli tristemente bianchi. Non continuate a dire che questo è un provvedimento storico perché nella storia ci entrerà per aver nuovamente preso in giro gli italiani. Concludo con un pensiero che spero serva ad aprire i cuori e le menti, un pensiero che mi auguro possa aiutare a riflettere sul compito che siamo qui a svolgere. Il prendersi cura è un atto creativo; è un gesto che modifica l'esistente generando bellezza. È un atto rivoluzionario che modifica lo scorrere grigio delle cose con i colori dell'attenzione, dell'ascolto, dell'amore. È, come l'arte, unico, irripetibile, inciso nella storia e nello spazio; e, come l'arte, è un bisogno pienamente umano. Dichiarando il voto contrario del Gruppo di Forza Italia, permettetemi di dire che un presupposto indispensabile per definire una società civile è la capacità del prendersi cura del suo popolo.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5195841193199158, 0.48041588068008423]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> BELLOT (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, cortesemente le chiedo un attimo di attenzione. Ricordiamo oggi il 51° anniversario della triste ricorrenza della catastrofe del Vajont. Oggi, da bellunese, essendo vicina a quei luoghi, sento il dovere di dare memoria alle 1.910 vittime del cieco egoismo di uomini che hanno anteposto l'interesse economico, il profitto al rispetto della vita umana. Alle 22,39 del 9 ottobre 1963 un'onda di piena dell'altezza di oltre 200 metri, causata dallo scivolamento di 260 milioni di metri cubi di roccia dal monte Toc nell'invaso artificiale del Vajont, spazzava un'intera comunità: bambini, donne e uomini, tutte vittime innocenti. Devastazione e dolore per una popolazione e un territorio che, ancora oggi, alzando lo sguardo, guarda quella diga intatta sovrastare il silenzio del ricordo, delle mille domande, del dolore. Lo scorso anno, in quest'Aula, ho chiesto alle istituzioni un segno di concreto rispetto in quanto c'era e c'è un infinito dolore per quelle lapidi bianche che, allineate nel cimitero monumentale di Fortogna, nel Longaronese... <p> Signora Presidente, le chiedo un po' di silenzio, perché credo che sia dovuto rispetto a queste persone. Diversamente, mi rifiuto di proseguire. <p> BELLOT (<PARTY>). Ripeto. Lo scorso anno, in quest'Aula, ho chiesto alle istituzioni un segno di concreto rispetto per questo infinito dolore, per quelle lapidi bianche che, allineate nel cimitero monumentale di Fortogna, nel Longaronese, ci conducono all'elenco senza fine di nomi di uomini, donne e bambini scolpiti all'interno della cappella. Per quel cimitero avevo chiesto il riconoscimento di un contributo annuale, presentando un emendamento alla legge di stabilità, necessario per conservare con la dignità e il rispetto dovuti il ricordo dei nostri morti ai superstiti che ancora li piangono. L'emendamento, però, è stato, come sempre, purtroppo, non considerato. Lo ripresenterò, perché il Governo deve colmare la sua assenza, deve avere un minimo di rispetto per la mia gente: morirono 1.910 persone, di cui la gran parte nei Comuni di Longarone, Codissago, Castellavazzo, Erto e Casso e 200 originarie di altri Comuni nel Bellunese. Non voglio fare polemica, ma, lo scorso anno, nel 50° anniversario, a parole, i rappresentanti delle istituzioni presenti alle celebrazioni ufficiali, dal presidente Grasso, all'ex Presidente del Consiglio Letta (ma mi rivolgo anche all'attuale presidente del Consiglio Renzi), avevano dato la loro disponibilità a reperire le risorse, poche, richieste, ma ad oggi ancora nulla. Nemmeno l'invito rivolto al presidente della Repubblica Giorgio Napolitano di andare a onorare i luoghi della memoria, per portare quelle scuse che ancora troppo pochi hanno ad oggi sentito il dovere di esprimere, ha avuto risposta. Mi rivolgo alle istituzioni, a chi le rappresenta, con quella forza del dolore silenzioso che distingue noi gente di montagna: non dimenticate, non dimenticateci, ed abbiate rispetto di chi ha subito questa enorme tragedia e ingiustizia perché non dobbiate più provare quel senso di vergogna che attualmente troppi devono ancora sopportare. Un minuto di silenzio è dovuto, ma chiedo anche un impegno concreto perché ad oggi il silenzio non basta più.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7661553025245667, 0.23384471237659454]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, rappresentanti del Governo, concentrerò questo mio intervento essenzialmente sull'allegato infrastrutture, l'undicesimo dalla sua istituzione. Un documento che, dal 2003, costituisce parte integrante dell'atto di programmazione più generale di economia e di finanza, come previsto dall'articolo 1 della legge obiettivo, come prevede l'articolo 10 della legge di contabilità e finanza pubblica e come più recentemente confermato anche dalla legge di coordinamento delle politiche economiche degli Stati membri. <p> Ciò nonostante, la redazione e l'esame di questo provvedimento da tempo si traducono sostanzialmente in un mero e formale adempimento burocratico: una sorta, insomma, di report informatico sullo stato di avanzamento dei lavori circa le grandi opere che nel corso degli anni hanno avuto differenti livelli di approvazione, di finanziamento e di realizzazione, e sulle quali non sempre è facile comprendere logica e raziocinio in un quadro programmatorio che si vorrebbe invece ordinato e certo. La spesa per investimenti, e segnatamente quella dedicata alla programmazione degli interventi finalizzati alla dotazione infrastrutturale del Paese, dovrebbe rappresentare il programma essenziale di sviluppo che un Paese riesce a darsi e coerentemente a perseguire. È chiaro che, nel contesto temporale dato, il Documento al nostro esame risente in maniera evidente e direi inevitabile dell'impostazione data dal Governo precedente piuttosto che da quello attualmente in carica. La prima osservazione, allora, è quella di chiedere al nuovo Governo, e segnatamente al Ministro competente, di affrontare con cura per il futuro, con la giusta attenzione e il dovuto rigore, il compito che la legge prevede e gli assegna. Una seria pianificazione non è un esercizio astratto, un libro dei sogni in cui ricomprendere tutte le più o meno legittime richieste che dai diversi territori del Paese provengono in ragione di un presunto o reale stato di deficit o arretratezza infrastrutturale; ma non è neppure l'assenza di qualsivoglia programmazione delle priorità, come di fatto la legge obiettivo ha deliberatamente costituito in questi dieci anni. In passato infatti si è assolto, da parte dei Governi che si sono succeduti, ad una funzione di sostanziale acritico accoglimento dello stato dei bisogni provenienti dai territori, spesso con accordi di programma Stato-Regioni svincolati da ogni logica di sostenibilità e di copertura finanziaria, fino a far lievitare così il Piano delle infrastrutture strategiche, come stimato dal 7° rapporto sull'attuazione della legge obiettivo, ad un ammontare di circa 375 miliardi di euro per le 390 opere previste. È giunto il momento di prendere atto della inadeguatezza della legge obiettivo a corrispondere alle effettive necessità che il tema infrastrutturale in questo decennio ha posto e a cui non è stata in grado di assolvere in termini di selezione delle priorità, di celerità nelle procedure di approvazione e di finanziamento e di certezza in termini di disponibilità finanziarie. I dati contenuti nel report dell'allegato infrastrutture sono eloquenti: se infatti si passa dall'universo delle 390 opere comprese nel <PARTY>S al valore delle 190 opere del perimetro CIPE, ovvero quelle approvate almeno una volta da detto organismo, con progetto preliminare o progetto definitivo e quadro finanziario allegato, il costo stimato si riduce a 142,5 miliardi di euro, pari solo al 38 per cento del costo dell'intero programma, rispetto al quale le risorse disponibili ammontano ad appena 78,3 miliardi di euro, che consentono una copertura finanziaria pari al 55 per cento del costo stimato. Ma le opere effettivamente realizzate e concluse nel decennio più recenti studi affermano attestarsi ad appena il 4 per cento e valutano nuove risorse per i prossimi anni in non più di quattro o cinque miliardi effettivi. Di fronte a questo quadro il Governo credo debba allora mettere più seriamente mano ad una pianificazione degna di questo nome: ve n'è bisogno, tanto più, nelle condizioni economiche che il Paese attraversa. Il che significa fare chiarezza, una volta per tutte, sulle effettive disponibilità finanziarie per i prossimi anni e su quelle realmente disponibili già adesso, perché è solo in ragione di queste che sarà possibile dimensionare priorità e tipologie realizzative. In conclusione, e sommessamente, alcune indicazioni che possono venire utili per il futuro che abbiamo di fronte. Questo Governo ha un anno di tempo per preparare un serio allegato infrastrutture dimensionato sulle risorse effettivamente disponibili: non lo sprechi! Circoscritto il perimetro delle risorse, definisca in ragione delle priorità comunitarie - le infrastrutture ricomprese nell'ambito della core network - quelle priorità necessarie che corrispondono per il nostro Paese agli obiettivi a breve e medio termine per il suo urgente ammodernamento infrastrutturale. Probabilmente si scoprirà che la stagione delle grandi opere dovrà essere momentaneamente accantonata in attesa di periodi economici migliori e che invece urge completare, con infrastrutture di raccordo e di potenziamento, quelle che sono le nostre naturali porte d'accesso per le merci e per i passeggeri, vale a dire i porti e gli aeroporti e il loro collegamento con le principali arterie ferroviarie e autostradali. Si scoprirà, forse, che probabilmente le opere e gli interventi necessari al rilancio della logistica nel nostro Paese, fattore determinante per la nostra economia, non solo non hanno bisogno di rilevanti risorse per interventi faraonici, ma che spesso con poche centinaia di milioni si potranno risolvere drammatici problemi di congestionamento, che in questi anni hanno fatto perdere tempo (e quindi denaro), ma anche occasioni di sviluppo importanti. Probabilmente, se avremo il coraggio di perseguire questa logica, scopriremo che si tratterà di opere che si ripagheranno da sole, grazie al miglioramento delle condizioni e delle ricadute economiche che produrranno su quei territori e che il solo non farle determina un costo ormai insopportabile per le collettività. Insomma, auguro a questo strano Governo e a questa più strana maggioranza che lo sostiene, a cui non è data la possibilità di fallire se vogliamo che la politica ripari ai danni prodotti in questi anni e recuperi la credibilità necessaria, una sorta di rivoluzione copernicana in tema di infrastrutture. Molto può essere fatto con poco, purché si faccia davvero e purché si faccia presto. Abbiamo un anno appena, non per il varo di poche e improbabili grandi opere, ma per un piano di tante piccole ma realistiche opere, in grado di mettere in pochi anni le ali al Paese, dare lavoro a migliaia di tecnici e operai e migliorare nei fatti le condizioni economiche delle nostre realtà industriali e le condizioni di vita dei nostri centri urbani. È solo dando fiducia alle potenzialità presenti sui territori che possiamo vincere la difficile sfida che abbiamo di fronte: quella di una crisi che sembra non darci respiro. Dobbiamo farlo soprattutto per la passione e la tenacia che ogni giorno milioni di italiani mettono nell'attività delle loro imprese, per far sì che l'Italia non sia una sciagurata condizione geografica, ma il più bello e importante marchio di fabbrica che abbiamo tutti a disposizione.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.714591920375824, 0.285408079624176]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> Avviso i colleghi che ci stanno seguendo, per video o per audio, che questa è l'ultima dichiarazione di voto, dopodiché procederemo alla chiama sulla questione di fiducia. <p> MARTINI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, il Gruppo del <PARTY> voterà a favore della fiducia e a favore del provvedimento al nostro esame. Lo farà per i motivi di sostanza e di analisi che sono stati qui proposti e anche per il merito dei contenuti indicati nella relazione del collega Pagliari, che ringrazio per il suo lavoro. Per quanto ci riguarda voglio farlo con gli argomenti che sono stati sostenuti dai miei colleghi nella discussione, sia qui in Senato (mi riferisco ai colleghi Albano, Favero e Mirabelli), che alla Camera nelle settimane scorse. Non li ripercorrerò tutti, ovviamente, per brevità e anche perché credo che siano noti, ma evidenzierò solo i punti salienti. Il decreto-legge ha definito con chiarezza e per la prima volta il concetto di sicurezza pubblica. La sicurezza urbana diventa dunque un bene pubblico, strettamente collegato al miglioramento della qualità della vita delle città. Può sembrare un argomento forse troppo generico per chi si perde un po' nei dettagli delle cose, ma credo che sia un punto politico da non smarrire. Sono anche indicati passi da compiere e che entrano a far parte della sicurezza: qualificazione urbanistica sociale e culturale, il recupero delle aree degradate, la promozione della cultura della legalità. Abbiamo un'agenda che sostiene il concetto di sicurezza come bene pubblico. In secondo luogo vi è un ruolo accresciuto e precisato dei sindaci e dei Comuni e più latamente delle autonomie, al di là delle retorica sui sindaci sceriffi. Potranno intervenire con più incisività sul degrado, sugli orari di vendita e di somministrazione degli alcolici e sugli orari delle sale giochi. È comunque un contributo al miglioramento della qualità delle città. Abbiamo una maggiore precisazione delle competenze del rapporto Stato-città e viene migliorato l'assetto istituzionale del governo della sicurezza. Questo è un tema che ci dovrebbe interessare molto, visto che tante volte abbiamo lamentato l'incertezza delle competenze e la sovrapposizione dei ruoli: lo Stato si occupa di ordine pubblico e sicurezza, Regioni e Comuni fanno accordi con lo Stato per la sicurezza integrata. È una traccia di lavoro sicuramente positiva. Viene riconosciuto il ruolo della polizia locale nella sicurezza integrata: non una polizia di serie B, ma una struttura cruciale perché conosce il territorio e ha relazione quotidiana con i cittadini. Vengono ripristinati l'equo indennizzo e il rimborso spese di degenza per cause di servizio che furono eliminati nel 2011. I Comuni con bilanci in ordine possono assumere agenti di polizia locale. È un contributo che può essere dato. Infine, ci sono nuovi strumenti di prevenzione e repressione: sanzioni amministrative, come l'allontanamento di chi impedisce la fruizione di luoghi pubblici, di parcheggiatori e commercianti abusivi, e per tutelare aree importanti socialmente ed economicamente. Sono inoltre previste misure contro l'abuso di alcol e atti vandalici e viene ripristinato l'arresto differito che consente alle Forze dell'ordine di lavorare meglio. Partendo da questi contenuti di merito - di cui do atto al ministro Minniti e al Governo - vorrei fare tre riflessioni di ordine generale per concludere la mia dichiarazione. La prima è questa: si avverte lo sforzo di collegare meglio prevenzione e repressione. Questi sono due elementi da tenere sempre insieme. Noi non vogliamo che prevalga la logica della paura, irresponsabilmente alimentata da troppi soggetti politici, sociali, comunicativi e informativi, perché non porta da nessuna parte e non ci consente di intervenire sulle cause dei problemi che abbiamo di fronte. Il problema della sicurezza non si risolve con l'inasprimento infinito delle pene, con la creazione di muri e barriere, né tantomeno con l'autodifesa privata, per di più se armata. Occorre un'intelligente azione che combini prevenzione e repressione e i patti per la sicurezza comprenderanno interventi di inclusione, di solidarietà sociale e di contrasto alla marginalità. So che molti dicono che queste sono parole cui non seguiranno fatti, ma intanto rappresentano un impegno politico e istituzionale che ci vincolerà e ci chiamerà tutti alla responsabilità. È un campo nuovo su cui vale la pena lavorare con convinzione ed è merito del decreto-legge in discussione averlo riproposto con forza. <p> (ore 15,55) ( Segue MARTINI). In secondo luogo, si torna a parlare con maggiore attenzione delle periferie: questo è un tema importante e non può essere una questione di moda o che viene sollevato soltanto dagli analisti dei risultati elettorali e dei vari referendum. Mi riferisco al tema delle periferie intese sia in senso geografico che sociale. Oggi la gran parte delle persone vive nelle periferie, anche dentro le grandi città, mentre chi vive nei centri storici è la larga minoranza delle stesse metropoli; tanta gente si sente comunque periferia. Questo è il risultato della crescita delle disuguaglianze sociali e anche delle iniquità presenti nello stesso sviluppo economico. Credo che aver rimesso questo tema al centro del dibattito sia un contributo politico che non possiamo sottovalutare. Vi è infine il tema del rapporto tra Stato e Comuni, tra Stato e Regioni, tra Stato e autonomie. È un punto importante di valore generale. Noi veniamo da una fase in cui il tema del rapporto tra centro e autonomie è stato molte volte vissuto come divisivo, ad esempio nella discussione sul Titolo V nella riforma costituzionale. Ora sappiamo che una contrapposizione, una distanza tra Stato e autonomie non serve né sulla sicurezza né su tutto il resto. Cogliamo quindi l'occasione offerta da questo decreto-legge per rilanciare la prospettiva di un autonomismo serio, efficace e cooperativo e contrastiamo la cultura della centralizzazione a tutti costi, che non produce né risparmio né migliore efficienza dello Stato. In definitiva, avviandomi alla conclusione, signor Presidente, penso che questo sia un impegno che meriti sostegno e lavoro continuo. Noi ci auguriamo che il presente decreto-legge sia stimolo anche a un più intenso dialogo sociale e ad un confronto nel territorio e sia stimolo di un riformismo che cresce dal basso insieme alle città, ai territori e alle istituzioni locali. Sarebbe un grande contributo per tutti noi.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5816912651062012, 0.41830870509147644]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, cari colleghi, innanzi tutto voglio ringraziare tutti i Gruppi per aver accettato di calendarizzare così velocemente la mozione della Lega, a prima firma Salvini, che è nata in modo molto spontaneo, durante uno scambio fra amici e colleghi, proprio nei giorni precedenti il giorno della memoria. <p> In particolare, con la senatrice Rivolta abbiamo parlato delle nostre rispettive esperienze nei campi di Mauthausen, dove sono stata da giovane con la scuola, e di Auschwitz, dove la senatrice Rivolta è stata da adulta. Discutendo e ricordando in giorni particolari, ho pensato che ognuno nella vita dovrebbe fare quel viaggio almeno una volta nella vita, possibilmente da giovane, per capire veramente, per quanto possibile, la tragedia dell'Olocausto e della Shoah. <p> Per questo motivo, proprio nel Giorno della Memoria, il 27 gennaio, con la senatrice Rivolta e il senatore Romeo abbiamo depositato un disegno di legge che va nella stessa direzione della mozione che ne è seguita, con cui proponiamo di incentivare i viaggi della memoria per gli studenti delle scuole superiori affinché il maggior numero possibile di ragazzi possa farlo. <p> Per fare ciò servono ovviamente dei fondi. Nel disegno di legge presentato abbiamo ipotizzato una cifra pari a 5 milioni di euro annui, da inserire però come misura strutturale all'interno della legge del 2000 che ha istituito il Giorno della Memoria. Tali fondi non sono sicuramente sufficienti, ma rappresentano un passo in avanti per far sì che più studenti rispetto a quelli di oggi possano fare i viaggi nei campi di concentramento e sterminio. <p> Sarei molto lieta se, oltre alla mozione in discussione oggi, tutti i colleghi qui presenti sottoscrivessero questo disegno di legge, lavorando con noi per migliorare il testo e magari convincere il Governo a impegnare più di 5 milioni di euro. <p> Da anni sappiamo che il Ministero dell'istruzione, dell'università e della ricerca collabora con l'Unione delle comunità ebraiche italiane su un progetto denominato «I giovani ricordano la Shoah», che prevede un concorso a cui partecipa però solo una parte delle scuole italiane. <p> Scusate, colleghi, sto parlando della Shoah. <p> Magari avete cose più importanti da fare, non so. Stiamo parlando della Shoah. Vi chiedo un po' di rispetto, e non per me. <p> <PARTY>ROVANO (<PARTY>). La ringrazio, signor Presidente. Come dicevo, si tratta di un contributo annuo di qualche centinaia di migliaia di euro per premiare gli studenti che partecipano al concorso e che garantisce ogni anno, oltre alle iniziative promosse in autonomia dalle scuole, un viaggio nei campi di concentramento e nei luoghi della memoria, ma solo a un centinaio di studenti. Noi vogliamo che vengano garantiti molti più viaggi per gli studenti di questo Paese, affinché ciascuno possa farlo almeno una volta nel proprio percorso di studi. Sapevo della Shoah fin da piccola, perché ho avuto la fortuna di avere una mamma che a casa guardava tutti i documentari e i film sul tema. Da grande ho poi approfondito e studiato, ma finché non sono stata a Mauthausen, della Shoah e dell'Olocausto non sapevo niente. Tante cose che ho studiato le ho dimenticate negli anni e di quella gita scolastica in Austria ho dei vaghi ricordi. Ricordo uno scorcio di Salisburgo, la bellissima Casa delle Farfalle di Vienna, una torta Sacher che ho portato a casa ai miei genitori e gli splendidi quadri di Klimt al Belvedere. Ho vaghi ricordi e delle immagini impresse nella mente. Ma della giornata al campo di concentramento di Mauthausen non ho mai dimenticato e mai dimenticherò una sola immagine. Faceva freddo, nevischiava, ma io avevo i vestiti. Era un posto orribile. Provavo il sentimento di voler uscire da lì il prima possibile, e sapevo che sarei uscita da lì. Abbiamo fatto un giro nei cortili, nelle baracche, ai forni crematori e nella piccola camera a gas. Sì, perché Mauthausen era un finto campo di concentramento: non c'erano grandi camere a gas come magari ad Auschwitz, perché lo sterminio avveniva in altro modo, in particolare attraverso il lavoro forzato nella vicina cava di granito. Non solo: lo sterminio dei deportati avveniva attraverso condanne a morte per inedia, per fame e sete nei blocchi della morte. Si provocava lo sfracellamento dei portatori di pietre sulla scala della morte, nel precipizio della cava; i prigionieri venivano sospinti dalla rupe, chiamata parete dei paracadutisti, e i suicidi venivano indotti dalla disperazione. C'erano colpi d'ascia o di armi bianche su folle di deportati; percosse, frustate, torture, strangolamenti e sbranamenti da parte dei cani delle SS; soppressione della quasi totalità degli ammalati, con iniezioni al cuore; introduzione nei forni crematori di soggetti ancora vivi; annegamenti forzati in secchi d'acqua o nella fogna; suicidi per una morte svelta e dolce, tramite il filo spinato elettrificato; colpi di rivoltella alla nuca durante false misurazioni dell'altezza; camere a gas mobili, mediante un camion con il tubo di scappamento rivolto all'interno del vano posteriore del veicolo; getto di idranti gelati in inverno, su prigionieri nudi, per tutta la notte; fucilazioni di massa; promiscuità in ambienti senza igiene con portatori di malattie infettive gravi; morte per assideramento, a causa del vestiario troppo leggero; esperimenti medici su cavie umane. Ricordo poi la raccolta dei lamponi: la farsa macabra di dotare i detenuti di cestini e obbligarli alla raccolta dei lamponi, che si trovavano fuori dai reticolati elettrici del campo, a cui seguiva la fucilazione da parte delle sentinelle per tentata fuga. Ricordo, ancora, il dissanguamento per le trasfusioni ai soldati tedeschi sul fronte orientale; le iniezioni letali nel cuore, con fenolo, benzina o altre sostanze venefiche; le impiccagioni e le autoimpiccagioni comandate; sterminio con regime alimentare volutamente ipocalorico e scarso per il pesante lavoro, appositamente studiato per far durare pochi mesi il deportato. Circa 200.000 persone, di diverse nazionalità, furono deportate a Mauthausen: dagli oppositori politici a persone perseguitate per motivi religiosi, a omosessuali, ebrei, zingari, prigionieri di guerra e criminali comuni e la metà dei deportati fu uccisa o trovò la morte per condizioni di vita e di lavoro disumane. Alla fine del giro nel campo, davvero difficile, i miei compagni e io siamo stati portati in una stanza dove ci hanno mostrato i filmati originali dell'epoca, girati in particolare dalle forze alleate, dagli americani, che hanno liberato il campo e hanno mostrato quale era la condizione al loro arrivo. Io ero lì, proprio lì, dove era accaduto tutto questo. Quando sono uscita dal campo che, a mano a mano che il bus si allontanava lo vedevo rimpicciolirsi all'orizzonte, piangevo come una bambina, perché ero triste, ma ero soprattutto davvero molto arrabbiata. Ero là, forse venticinque anni fa o qualcosa in più, e oggi sono qui. Ho avuto la fortuna di essere eletta in Senato, faccio parte delle istituzioni e - così come è capitato a me e a voi, colleghi - i giovani di oggi saranno un domani su questi banchi o in posti importanti per la vita pubblica del Paese. Nell'illustrare oggi la presente mozione, rappresento un piccolo tassello della memoria, che dovrà aggiungersi ad altri tasselli di un puzzle che non sarà mai completo. La presente mozione e il disegno di legge ad essa collegato sono stati depositati prima che uscissero i dati, preoccupanti, dell'Eurispes, riferiti allo scorso anno, il 2019, secondo cui il 15,6 per cento del popolo italiano nega che la Shoah sia mai esistita, o non ne conosce l'esistenza: probabilmente è un misto delle due cose. Questo è allarmante perché, se pensiamo che nel 2004 il dato era di 2,7, non stiamo andando nella giusta direzione. Ricordo anche che il nostro impegno è importante, ma non è necessario avere un ruolo pubblico per fare la differenza, per combattere l'antisemitismo e ogni forma di discriminazione basata sulla razza, sul colore della pelle, sull'orientamento sessuale e sul credo religioso. Vorrei ricordare non solo i quasi sei milioni di ebrei morti nella Shoah, ma anche i 27.362 Giusti tra le Nazioni, di cui 714 italiani, perché sono la prova che allora qualcosa si poteva fare e che il singolo può fare la differenza. <p> Sommando uno più uno, più uno, più uno e così via, si arriva a 27.362, ed è un dato non ufficiale perché tanti non sono noti. Ho cercato un dato che non ho trovato ieri: quanti sono gli ebrei che sono stati salvati dai Giusti, conosciuti e non conosciuti? Quanti se ne sarebbero aggiunti a quei sei milioni se singole persone non li avessero aiutati? Io oggi indosso una camicia gialla - come vedete - per due motivi: in primo luogo, ho pensato a un bellissimo messaggio che ha lanciato la senatrice Segre - mi spiace non abbia potuto essere qui oggi proprio nei giorni della commemorazione della Shoah - con cui ricordava un disegno fatto da una bimba di Terezin: una farfalla gialla che volava sopra un filo spinato. Diceva la senatrice Segre di essere come la farfalla gialla che vola sopra i fili spinati. Questo dovremmo fare, noi uomini delle istituzioni: volare alto, almeno quando trattiamo temi così importanti, senza manipolazioni, senza retro pensieri, in alto sopra tutte le nostre differenze. <p> Il secondo motivo è che questa camicia era di mia mamma e, l'ha confezionata lei stessa. Mia mamma era un'artista nel lavoro e nella vita. Lei mi ha insegnato la differenza tra giusto e sbagliato, a non essere né di destra, né di sinistra. Mi ha insegnato a trattare le persone con rispetto, a prescindere che fossero un re o la persona più umile che incontravo sul mio cammino. Mi ha insegnato a non accettare mai qualcosa che ritenessi profondamente sbagliato, né per paura, né per convenienza. Mi ha insegnato a difendere sempre i più deboli perché - mi diceva - se non lo avessi fatto io, forse non lo avrebbe fatto nessun altro. <p> Onore ai Giusti, di ieri, di oggi e di domani.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5082013607025146, 0.49179863929748535]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, rappresentante del Governo, onorevoli colleghe e colleghi, siamo qui a discutere del disegno di legge di conversione del decreto-legge n. 22 del 25 marzo 2019, che reca misure urgenti per assicurare sicurezza, stabilità finanziaria e integrità dei mercati, nonché tutela della salute e della libertà di soggiorno dei cittadini italiani e di quelli del Regno Unito, in caso di recesso di quest'ultimo dall'Unione europea. <p> Lo abbiamo detto a più riprese sia come maggioranza parlamentare che di Governo: l'Italia si farà trovare pronta in caso di uscita del Regno Unito dall'Unione europea.

La ricerca della stabilità, della tutela e della sicurezza degli interessi italiani rimangono per noi l'obiettivo centrale della nostra azione politica. <p> Vado brevemente a illustrare i contenuti del provvedimento in esame, che introduce, come detto, misure urgenti per garantire la stabilità finanziaria e l'integrità dei mercati e ha l'obiettivo di rafforzare la tutela dei depositanti, degli investitori e degli assicurati, alla luce della rapida evoluzione del contesto internazionale e della situazione relativa al Regno Unito. Il decreto-legge, in particolare, reca disposizioni che disciplinano diversi ambiti specifici, come ad esempio l'esercizio dei poteri speciali nei settori di rilevanza strategica, misure dirette a disciplinare le conseguenze del possibile recesso del Regno Unito dall'Unione europea e da ultimo, il mantenimento, con alcune necessarie modifiche, dello schema di concessione della garanzia dello Stato sulla cartolarizzazione di sofferenze.

A riprova della lungimiranza del Governo, che ha scelto di arrivare preparato a un'ipotesi di no deal, un'intera sezione riguarda esclusivamente misure in caso di uscita del Regno Unito dall'Unione europea senza un accordo. In particolare, tale sezione, reca norme in tema di prestazione dei servizi e delle attività in Italia da parte di soggetti del settore bancario del Regno Unito dopo la data di recesso, con particolare riguardo al periodo transitorio. Reca, inoltre, norme volte a garantire l'operatività dei gestori italiani di sedi di negoziazione del Regno Unito durante il periodo transitorio. Prevede inoltre disposizioni per la tutela dei depositanti e degli investitori, stabilendo che le banche del Regno Unito che alla data di recesso svolgono in Italia attività ammesse al mutuo riconoscimento si considerano di diritto aderenti ai sistemi di garanzia dei depositanti italiani. All'interno del provvedimento vengono previste, inoltre, disposizioni per la tutela dei cittadini italiani. Viene disposta l'equiparazione dei cittadini del Regno Unito ai cittadini dell'Unione europea ai fini della concessione della cittadinanza, in caso risiedano da almeno quattro anni in Italia. Vengono previsti, inoltre, diversi stanziamenti per il potenziamento dei servizi consolari nel Regno Unito, nonché ulteriori disposizioni per la tutela dei cittadini italiani ivi residenti. Nella terza parte il provvedimento mira a perseguire gli obiettivi del Governo sul tema della tutela e della protezione del sistema bancario, disciplinando l'estensione della garanzia sulla cartolarizzazione delle sofferenze. Nell'avviarmi alla conclusione, vorrei effettuare un passaggio politico sulla vicenda Brexit. Il 23 giugno del 2016, tramite un referendum consultivo, i cittadini del Regno Unito hanno votato in maggioranza per l'uscita dall'Unione europea. Abbiamo assistito sin da subito a schiere di intellettuali che, insieme al sistema mediatico internazionale, hanno gridato allo scandalo, al popolo ignorante e privo dei mezzi necessari per comprendere dinamiche politiche così complicate, e hanno criticato la legittimità del voto. Nelle ultime settimane, si legge sempre più spesso, che queste future elezioni europee, alle quali parteciperà anche il Regno Unito, saranno un vero e proprio secondo referendum. In caso di sconfitta dei conservatori sarebbe chiaro e lampante il cambio di idea del popolo del Regno Unito sulla questione Brexit. <p> A riprova di queste tesi che vogliono screditare il risultato del referendum, viene citato il mancato accordo tra i membri del Parlamento del Regno Unito sulle modalità di uscita dall'Unione. Lo voglio dire forte e chiaro: non è possibile dare adito a tali assurdità. Va chiarito, senza timore di smentita, l'incapacità manifesta della politica di tradurre in atti concreti le voci e i desideri dei cittadini, legittimamente espressi tramite un referendum. Non può diventare una scusa o un alibi per chi vuole a tutti i costi ribaltare il voto del giugno del 2016. La democrazia e la volontà popolare sono concetti sacri. Sono concetti che devono essere difesi sempre, non solo quando fanno comodo a qualcuno in particolare. Sono la base su cui si fondano le nostre democrazie ed è nostro dovere rispettarli. Con questo provvedimento noi dimostriamo di rispettare il popolo inglese e il processo della Brexit e adeguiamo il nostro ordinamento per tutelare e garantire la sicurezza economica dei nostri cittadini e delle nostre imprese.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5766152143478394, 0.42338475584983826]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, visti i contenuti della relazione del collega Corsini e sottolineata l'estrema e drammatica attualità dei contenuti di questa ratifica - come peraltro già fatto dal relatore - non mi resta, in questa sede, che richiamare tutti all'urgenza della sua approvazione. <p> Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> STUCCHI (<PARTY>).

Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, le mozioni presentate oggi ci hanno consentito di aprire questo dibattito che evidenzia chiaramente dei concetti assolutamente contraddittori, come è chiaro che sia quando si parla di questi drammi umanitari. L'Europa sta vivendo questa terribile esperienza e, più di ogni altro Paese, patisce le ricadute negative di questo dramma (insieme ad alcuni Stati). Infatti, per la sua posizione geografica e per i suoi rapporti con il Mediterraneo e con l'Africa, l'Italia soffre particolarmente, più di ogni altro Stato europeo. L'Europa si trova al centro di un equilibrio tra le aspirazioni proprie dell'Unione di confermarsi area di pace, solidarietà e sviluppo e la necessità di assicurare sicurezza ai propri abitanti. È quindi, quello di cui stiamo discutendo, un fenomeno grave, quasi emergenziale. In molte mozioni si è parlato di emergenza, ma io sarei cauto nell'utilizzo dei termini perché gli esperti ci dicono che questi flussi migratori persisteranno almeno per i prossimi venti o trent'anni, per cui c'è la necessità di affrontare questo problema con iniziative strutturali e assolutamente stabili, piuttosto che con misure emergenziali. Ritengo che l'approccio avuto dall'Italia rispetto a questo fenomeno sia assolutamente encomiabile, così come lo è stato quello tenuto dagli Stati europei, che però hanno contribuito poco ad aiutare la nostra azione e spesso ci hanno isolati. È chiaro infatti che creare muri, barriere come di fatto è avvenuto, e deroghe alla convenzione di Dublino o agli accordi di Schengen non fa altro che ostacolare la libera circolazione in Europa dei migranti e rendere ancora più pesante e oneroso il compito dell'Italia, che sta applicando in maniera positiva delle misure importanti che ci hanno portato, rispetto a tre o quattro anni fa, ad una situazione migliore dal punto di vista dell'accoglienza. Dico questo perché funzionano gli hotspot, funzionano la raccolta delle impronte digitali e l'identificazione dei migranti con il sistema Eurodac. C'è una convenzione con l'ANCI per una distribuzione più equa dei migranti all'interno della nostra superficie, per evitare che si creino anche aree periferiche di ghettizzazione nelle grandi città. Pertanto, incentivi e forme di riconoscenza verso quei Comuni (purtroppo ancora pochi, soltanto 2.600 su 8.000) che si adoperano per accogliere migranti, sicuramente funzionano e dovranno funzionare. Si è parlato spesso in quest'Aula di migration compact. Su questo vorrei dire alcune parole, signora Presidente. È vero che è assolutamente giusto affrontare il problema alla radice, e cioè negli Stati da dove partono i migranti. Stiamo però attenti, perché le sperimentazioni, delle quali ha parlato anche il commissario Mogherini, funzionano laddove gli Stati collaborano. In alcune mozioni si parla di creare uffici di emigrazione negli Stati africani. L'idea è buona, ma come si fa a creare un ufficio laddove la gente scappa perché è terrorizzato in quanto priva della propria libertà? Le mozioni in esame contengono alcuni suggerimenti assolutamente accettabili. Il Gruppo di Area Popolare voterà chiaramente a favore di quelle sulle quali il Governo ha espresso parere favorevole.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5865873694419861, 0.41341260075569153]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, rappresentante del Governo, colleghi, siamo di fronte a un ennesimo intervento d'urgenza in materia di enti locali, dopo che già a metà del mese di luglio abbiamo approvato una legge che ha stabilito le nuove regole ordinamentali per la loro contabilità. Anziché creare un clima di certezza normativa e consentire agli enti che governano il territorio di programmare sul lungo periodo i propri bilanci e i propri interventi a sostegno delle comunità di riferimento, si continua a perpetuare un quadro normativo transitorio. <p> A legislazione vigente le regole sono queste, ma non è detto che durino a lungo. Si mormora di un ulteriore contributo alle finanze pubbliche, che verrà richiesto agli enti del territorio, da inserire nella legge di stabilità per il 2017. Quindi, da qui a breve, cambiando il quadro economico-finanziario, anche le regole subiranno ulteriori modifiche. <p> Il decreto-legge in esame, poi, contiene proprio di tutto, come è ormai abitudine del Governo e come tanti colleghi anche questa sera hanno ricordato nel corso del dibattito in Assemblea. Esso si è ulteriormente gonfiato, strada facendo, di articoli e commi, che entrano in un testo già inizialmente assolutamente eterogeneo. Allora, qualche domanda bisogna porsela immediatamente. È mai possibile che per qualsiasi cosa succeda in Italia ci sia bisogno di un decreto-legge? È credibile che non esista una provvista di risorse, nell'ambito del bilancio dello Stato, per poter intervenire in casi di necessità, senza bisogno di un decreto-legge? È pensabile che si debba intervenire su ogni cosa e, ancora, su fatti accaduti nel lontano 1998? É ammissibile che anche norme di carattere ordinamentale debbano essere cambiate in continuazione? Questo è, a nostro avviso, un modo di procedere completamente sbagliato e costituisce una strada che produce solamente incertezze normative e decisionali. <p> Il decreto-legge in esame, lievitato da 25 a 41 articoli, più una serie di commi aggiuntivi, dotati comunque di una propria portata normativa, non semplifica la vita degli enti che si occupano del governo del territorio e non risolve i loro problemi. Per quanto riguarda Comuni, Province e Regioni, il problema principale era e resta quello di essere, di fatto, passati dall'idea di finanza propria dei primi anni Novanta a questa idea di finanza derivata a giorni alterni, che è completamente illogica. Ogni mediazione di denaro ha un costo: quando la mediazione avviene in ambito politico e passa attraverso più livelli decisionali, ai costi iniziali si sommano oneri ulteriori. Seguendo quindi questa ondata di antipolitica, che noi legislatori avremmo dovuto contrastare e non assecondare, si è addebitata ogni sorta di nefandezza alla gestione dei Comuni, delle Province e delle Regioni. Quando, al contrario, chi riesce a mantenere una certa obiettività, non può che riconoscere che gli enti di Governo del territorio hanno fatto il meglio di sé, producendo investimenti, infrastrutture e benessere nel momento in cui hanno avuto risorse proprie a disposizione. <p> Certamente vi sono stati alcuni casi di sperpero assurti all'onore delle cronache, ma gli sprechi veri esistono, e continueranno ad esserci, soprattutto a livello della spesa statale, dove il controllo non è prossimo, dove le somme sono più elevate e dove i margini di distrazione sono maggiori. E certamente la nuova china che si è presa ora non premia i Comuni ben amministrati, ma premia quelli governati male, non gratifica i Comuni virtuosi, ma gratifica quelli spendaccioni. <p> Ma sopratutto non vi è alcuna perequazione tra imposte versate e risorse poi ridistribuite ai territori. Risorse e responsabilità sono alla base di ogni buona regola di finanza locale dei territori laddove, sia in Europa che nel mondo, si registrano efficienza e buona amministrazione. E quindi, oltre ad essere un sistema fiscale ingiusto, non innesca quella sana concorrenza tra il buongoverno dei differenti enti del territorio, che è uno dei richiami per attrarre nuovi residenti o nuovi insediamenti produttivi. <p> La mediazione statale, operata anche sui fondi che riguardano i Governi territoriali è ora completamente iniqua. Lo dimostra il fatto che troppe sono ancora le partite finanziarie aperte, ad esempio, tra lo Stato ed i Comuni. Lo dimostra la necessità, oggi, di finanziare le funzioni fondamentali delle Province, che ieri inopinatamente sono state sacrificate. Detto per inciso, lo si fa prendendo 100 milioni all'ANAS. <p> La cosa più allucinante è, inoltre, arrendersi all'idea che senza i calderoni che contengono i fondi perequativi i Comuni non possano andare avanti. La cosa più grave è che ci si è assuefatti a questa idea che i Comuni, le Province e le Regioni non abbiano risorse. Non è esatto dire che non le hanno. La verità è che le risorse gli sono state tolte da questo ritorno a un neocentralismo della peggior specie. <p> Esso inizia con i tagli ai bilanci degli enti territoriali, sacrificandoli alle manovre di finanza pubblica, prosegue con un incerto ritorno alla finanza derivata e continuerà qualora venisse approvato il quesito al referendum costituzionale. Se vincesse il sì, si avrebbe un ulteriore centralismo, che non lascerebbe spazio alla azione dei neo senatori, rappresentanti dei Comuni e delle Regioni cooptati nel nuovo Senato. Essi non avrebbero alcuna reale possibilità di incidere sulle politiche nazionali, ma nemmeno su quelle dei territori che rappresentano. Un'altro luogo comune di questi giorni è quello, più volte ripetuto, che attraverso le modifiche alla legge di contabilità in attuazione della legge rinforzata, conseguente alle novella costituzionale dell'articolo 81, non saranno più possibili interventi micro settoriali o localistici. A parte il fatto che anche con la legge di contabilità vigente tali interventi non sarebbero dovuto essere possibili. Al contrario, noi tutti abbiamo presente quanto accaduto nelle ultime leggi di stabilità che contenevano numerose norme micro settoriali. Ma poi cosa dovrebbe significare quanto appena affermato: che dovremo assistere ad altri decreti-legge, come quello ora in Aula, infarciti di norme micro settoriali o localistiche di ogni tipo, perché non si possono più mettere nella nuova legge di bilancio? Siamo ovviamente all'assurdo! Inoltre non si può sottacere il lungo elenco di articoli e commi aggiunti al decreto-legge al nostro esame, per i quali è stata presentata una tardiva relazione tecnica, che non riesce a fugare i dubbi sulle coperture finanziarie. A questo proposito una domanda: è mai possibile che il Governo che intende digitalizzare la pubblica amministrazione non riesca ad inviare al Senato una relazione tecnica in un formato elettronico pienamente leggibile, anziché una pessima copia via telefax ? Concludendo, ci troviamo di fronte a norme spot, da cui poi non possono derivare misure risolutive dei problemi affrontati. Questo decreto-legge, andandosi a sommare agli altri 50 precedentemente emanati, ci convince ancora di più della inadeguatezza dell'azione del Governo. Il Paese ha gettato letteralmente via trentatre mesi in cui si sarebbe potuto cercare di agganciare quella timida ripresa che ha caratterizzato l'economia mondiale e di cui l'Italia ha beneficiato solo in minima parte. Al contrario, inseguiamo provvedimenti che, nella forma, nello stile e nei contenuti, ricalcano modelli già visti e rivisti, che non hanno aiutato e non aiuteranno a fare andare avanti il Paese. È un provvedimento talmente inutile - fatte salve alcune norme che qualche collega prima del mio intervento ha sottolineato, e che meritano il nostro rispetto- che non varrebbe nemmeno la pena di essere commentato. Manca tutto ciò che dovrebbe servire per avviare una fase nuova per le finanze degli enti locali, che consegni finalmente ai governi del territorio autonomia, risorse, programmazione e responsabilità.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5740371942520142, 0.4259628355503082]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> GUALDANI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, premetto subito che, dati i tempi, sarò costretto a chiedere di allegare parte del mio intervento. Innanzitutto, vorrei ringraziare tutti i commissari della Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sul fenomeno delle intimidazioni nei confronti degli amministratori locali e la presidente Lo Moro per il lavoro svolto in maniera sinergica e compatta. Il mio è un ringraziamento sentito e schietto. Nel corso del lavoro svolto sono emersi dati relativi a denunce, omicidi e abbandoni (perché qualcuno ha deciso di gettare la spugna) che ci hanno sconvolto e rattristato. Il nostro obiettivo principale, quindi, è evitare l'isolamento degli amministratori. Secondo noi, questo è un concetto che deve stare alla base della vita democratica del nostro Paese. Quanto al merito del mio intervento, bisogna lavorare per evitare l'isolamento degli amministratori, che spesso è una precondizione dell'intimidazione e per rafforzare le istituzioni locali, a partire dai municipi che rappresentano, secondo una bella immagine usata dal presidente della Repubblica, Sergio Mattarella, «il volto della Repubblica», che si presenta ai cittadini «nella vita di tutti i giorni». Per tale ragione, si ritiene assolutamente auspicabile il potenziamento degli strumenti di raccordo e di scambio di informazioni fra le amministrazioni centrali e periferiche dello Stato, la magistratura e gli enti territoriali. La creazione di una rete e una minore discrezionalità nei processi decisionali consentirebbero non solo di assicurare maggiori tutele agli amministratori locali, ma anche di garantire una maggiore trasparenza ed efficienza dell'azione amministrativa. I lavori della Commissione non si sono limitati soltanto ad un'analisi dello status quo, ma sono sfociati appunto in proposte di soluzioni che potrebbero fornire degli argini al dilagare del fenomeno. Gli interventi valutati favorevolmente dalla Commissione possono essere sostanzialmente ricondotti a due categorie: misure generali di natura per lo più organizzativa ed interventi puntuali, di carattere anche normativo, nell'ambito dei singoli settori maggiormente colpiti dal fenomeno intimidatorio. Tra questi ultimi, ambiti estremamente fertili per il sorgere delle intimidazioni sono quelli dell'abusivismo edilizio, delle cave e delle connesse attività estrattive e degli appalti. I rischi connessi alla infiltrazione della criminalità organizzata aumentano nel settore del commercio e delle licenze e in relazione al settore del gioco d'azzardo, come ricordato poco fa da una collega. Sulle politiche di welfare una possibile risposta ai problemi connessi a tale settore potrebbe essere ravvisata nell'aumento della trasparenza nelle procedure di assegnazione di sussidi, alloggi e contributi, situazioni in cui gli amministratori locali sono lasciati soli alle loro riflessioni. Da ultimo, vorrei soffermarmi sugli aspetti penalistici della materia. Dall'inchiesta portata avanti in Commissione è emersa con forza la necessità di rivedere la normativa penale per consentire l'utilizzo di strumenti di indagine attualmente inibiti e per predisporre, sotto il profilo penale, una adeguata tutela dell'amministratore locale. Auspico vivamente che tutte le soluzioni prospettate dalla Commissione, o buona parte di esse, vengano prese in considerazione e che si avvii il prima possibile l' iter parlamentare attraverso il quale la disciplina penale repressiva delle forme intimidatorie veda luce in un lasso di tempo ristretto.

Sono queste le parole testuali dell' incipit della presentazione del presidente Monti. All'appuntamento con la stretta finanziaria sui bilanci pubblici, diventata più stringente in Europa successivamente al Patto di stabilità e crescita ed emergenziale nella seconda metà del 2011 per i fatti che voi conoscete, la spesa sanitaria si è presentata con una dinamica di crescita fortemente ridimensionata nell'arco temporale 2007-2012, registrando un tasso medio di crescita dell'1,7 per cento, che è lontano da quel 6,4 medio che aveva caratterizzato il periodo 2000-2006. Sono stati e sono tuttora molteplici i determinanti di un trend di crescita della spesa sanitaria, alcuni dei quali strutturali all'evoluzione del sistema sanitario. Ne cito alcuni: l'ingresso di nuove tecnologie e nuovi farmaci mediamente più costosi, che, almeno in una prima fase, si aggiungono e non sostituiscono vecchie pratiche o vecchi farmaci; l'invecchiamento della popolazione, che dilata la platea dei destinatari di complessi servizi sanitari e sociosanitari long term. Altri determinanti sono invece espressione di alcuni problemi non risolti, o quanto meno di ambiguità. Sul piano istituzionale, penso al riparto dei compiti e delle funzioni tra Stato e Regioni; ai ritardi nell'innovazione organizzativa e gestionale; a una pluralità di modelli aziendalistici in gran parte insufficienti a governare la complessità della produzione di servizi caratterizzati da un'altissima densità di competenze professionali e di valori etici e civili con pochi uguali nel mondo della produzione. A questo si aggiunge il peso, il gravame di sacche di inappropriatezza tecnica, di inefficienza organizzativa e gestionale, di vicinanze improprie tra ricerca del consenso politico e gestione amministrativa e finanche del merito e della qualità professionale. Infine, isolati ma nondimeno allarmanti, sono da registrare fenomeni corruttivi e di inquinamenti malavitosi. Va però respinta con forza una deriva che talora affiora anche nel dibattito e nella comunicazione, secondo la quale il nostro Servizio sanitario nazionale è un costo insopportabile, un carrozzone inefficiente e inefficace: esso - in realtà - è, pur con tutti i sui limiti, una grande e straordinaria opera tecnico‑professionale, civile e sociale che garantisce ricerca e sviluppo, occupazione qualificata e soprattutto, secondo i principi di universalismo ed equità, coesione sociale e identità civile al nostro Paese. Nelle prossime settimane il Consiglio Ecofin dell'Unione europea, a fine maggio, sancirà l'uscita del nostro Paese dalle procedure di eccesso di deficit. I dati del DEF ci dicono che la nostra sanità ha svolto, come si diceva qualche mese o anno fa, i suoi compiti a casa. La spesa pubblica del settore relativa al 2012 è, in valore assoluto, di poco superiore a quella del 2009; per il 2013 è indicata una crescita della spesa sul 2012 di circa lo 0,2 per cento, mentre dal 2014 al 2017 è indicata una crescita con un tasso medio dell'1,9, a fronte di una contestuale previsione di crescita del <PARTY>L nominale più alta. Questo differenziale porta ad una stima della spesa sanitaria pubblica sul <PARTY>L in decrescita, raggiungendo nel 2017 il valore del 6,7 per cento, che rafforzerebbe la nostra posizione nell'Unione europea a 15 tra i Paesi a più bassa spesa, in termini percentuali sul <PARTY>L e assoluti procapite. Hanno dunque prodotto risultati sui saldi contabili le pesanti misure messe in atto dai Governi Berlusconi e Monti, che, in combinato disposto, hanno determinato, nell'arco temporale 2010-2014, un definanziamento pubblico del Servizio sanitario nazionale per cumulativi 25-30 miliardi di euro (questo secondo diverse stime). A fronte di ciò, condivido quanto ormai da più parti autorevoli e terze viene detto: il Servizio sanitario nazionale non può sopportare ulteriori politiche di definanziamento pubblico, salvo scontare inaccettabili cadute dell'universalismo e dell'equità di accesso alle prestazioni. Al riguardo, ricordo quanto dichiarato dal presidente Errani, che, nel rappresentare il pensiero unanime delle Regioni e delle Province autonome, ha chiesto che il finanziamento dei servizi sanitari regionali erogati nel 2012 resti tale anche per il 2013, evitando il taglio netto di un miliardo e denunciando l'effetto devastante sulla tenuta dei sistemi della previsione relativa al 2014 di ulteriori due miliardi di compartecipazione dei cittadini ai costi delle prestazioni. Sono saliti i ticket, è salita la pressione fiscale, sono salite le aliquote regionali, soprattutto nelle Regioni sottoposte ai piani di rientro, e le cifre sono molto vicine a quelle dell'IMU sulla prima casa. Vorrei concludere, signor Presidente, ricordando quanto, pochi giorni fa, la direttrice generale dell'Organizzazione mondiale della sanità europea, a conclusione di un meeting, ha detto sull'impatto in Europa della crisi economica sulle politiche sanitarie. Così cito: «In tempi di crisi, è forse ancora più importante proteggere il finanziamento dei sistemi sanitari, dal momento che i bisogni di salute possono crescere rapidamente; assicurare l'accesso ai servizi di salute è un aspetto cruciale di una più ampia rete di sicurezza sociale (...) tagli inappropriati possono solo peggiorare i sistemi sanitari. Che (...) devono fare di tutto per minimizzare gli sprechi e perseguire l'appropriatezza». Ecco, signor Presidente, nell'affrontare l'agenda delle riforme, anche a partire dalla Nota di aggiornamento del DEF, ma più incisivamente nella legge di stabilità, dovremo ricordarci nelle nostre scelte di questo, perché questa è l'Europa a cui guardiamo: l'Europa dell'equità, della solidarietà, dell'universalismo dei diritti fondamentali del cittadino.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.560772716999054, 0.4392273426055908]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> MILO (<PARTY>).

Ci si muove quindi nel solco della continuità di un impegno che ha portato le Camere ad interrogarsi sia sul fenomeno mafioso nazionale e tradizionale sia - sottolineo in particolare questo profilo - sulle nuove organizzazioni criminali straniere, le quali si sono installate purtroppo sul territorio nazionale parallelamente ai migranti dei rispettivi Paesi d'origine. Non potrebbe essere altrimenti, attesa la gravità della minaccia che lo sviluppo del crimine organizzato rappresenta alla sovranità dello Stato e all'esercizio dei diritti democratici dei cittadini, in Italia come altrove. <p> Il testo che giunge oggi all'esame della nostra Assemblea è il frutto di un lavoro complesso e condiviso, che si conclude sotto il segno dell'unitarietà, come del resto è accaduto a Montecitorio. <p> Vorrei solo sottolineare alcune parti molto rilevanti. <p> L'articolo 1 prevede un mandato di legislatura e un ampio ventaglio di materie di investigazione: dalla gestione dei pentiti all'attuazione del regime carcerario introdotto dall'articolo 41‑ bis; dalla congruità della legislazione nazionale antimafia allo studio dei mutamenti del fenomeno della criminalità organizzata; dai rapporti tra mafia e politica, con particolare riguardo al condizionamento nella scelta delle persone candidate alle cariche elettive, alle tecniche di difesa nelle gare d'appalto. È importante ancora sottolineare che si indagherà anche sulle associazioni di stampo mafioso straniere, come ho detto prima, in quanto operanti sul territorio italiano, come tra l'altro si fa anche da diverse legislature. Altresì importante si rivela l'articolo 2, che riguarda la composizione stessa della Commissione. È prevalsa infatti l'idea di nominare 25 deputati e 25 senatori per renderla ancora più solida e rappresentativa di quanto originariamente previsto. L'articolo 4 contiene disposizioni concernenti la disciplina delle audizioni ed estende all'attività della Commissione anche l'applicazione di alcune norme del diritto processuale. Viene poi precisata - anche questo è molto importante - l'impossibilità di opporre alla Commissione il segreto di Stato rispetto a fatti rientranti nelle sue competenze. Vi è poi una norma che prevede la richiesta di atti e documenti introducendo anche un regime di eccezioni ad un articolo del codice di procedura penale, in modo da permettere l'acquisizione di atti processuali concernenti i procedimenti ancora in corso. C'è quindi la possibilità di deferire ad un regolamento l'organizzazione interna della Commissione. Altro aspetto importante è la procedura accelerata di entrata in vigore, onde agevolare il più possibile la sollecita ricostituzione della Commissione. Come Gruppo della <PARTY> sosterremo certamente l'approvazione del provvedimento che giudichiamo conforme all'interesse di accertare la portata del fenomeno mafioso, vecchio e nuovo, e la congruità delle misure di contrasto adottate per fronteggiarlo. Tuttavia, permane il rammarico di constatare come, ad oltre 150 anni dall'unificazione italiana, lo Stato unitario non sia ancora riuscito a venire a capo del problema, che per certi versi si è anche allargato quanto ad aree di insistenza. Desideriamo a questo proposito ricordare che è stata proprio la Lega Nord, in passate legislature, a battersi affinché il campo dell'indagine dell'Antimafia venisse allargato alle Regioni esterne al novero di quelle tradizionalmente infestate dalla grande criminalità organizzata, e non solo per tener conto dell'attività delle triadi cinesi. Cogliamo poi l'occasione per rivendicare ad un Ministro leghista, Roberto Maroni, ora alla testa del nostro movimento, i risultati più egregi in termini di contrasto alle infiltrazioni malavitose. <p> Per questo motivo e perché condividiamo il provvedimento nel suo insieme, preannuncio già che la Lega voterà a favore dell'approvazione della ricostituzione dell'Antimafia.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7157426476478577, 0.2842573821544647]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, desidero ringraziare tutti i colleghi per i loro interventi, che sono stati tutti costruttivi. Credo però che forse alcune cose vadano sottolineate e ribadite. <p> In primo luogo voglio parlare dei poteri dell'amministratore delegato, che sono poteri strategici e che si è detto essere fuori dalla norma. Invito tutti a verificare quali sono le funzioni di un amministratore delegato in qualsiasi azienda, ma per entrare proprio nel novero dei poteri dell'amministratore delegato dell'azienda RAI si legge nel disegno di legge in esame che il consiglio d'amministrazione «approva il piano industriale e il piano editoriale, il preventivo di spesa annuale, nonché gli investimenti». Non lo fa l'amministratore delegato, ma il consiglio d'amministrazione. L'amministratore delegato cosa fa, dunque? Egli - sempre secondo il testo di legge al nostro esame - «risponde al consiglio d'amministrazione in merito alla gestione aziendale» e «assicura la coerenza della programmazione televisiva con le linee editoriali e le direttive formulate e adottate dal consiglio d'amministrazione». Egli inoltre «propone all'approvazione del consiglio d'amministrazione gli atti e i contratti aziendali» e provvede all'attuazione del piano industriale, fatto dal consiglio d'amministrazione. <p> Se dunque vogliamo dire che c'è un uomo solo al comando, non sappiamo come funzionano le aziende nel nostro Paese. Non c'è un uomo solo al comando, ma un uomo che si assume le responsabilità, mentre le linee guida industriali e di programmazione sono in mano al consiglio d'amministrazione. Questo lo voglio ribadire, anche alla luce di quanto ho sentito ripetere troppe volte. Devo dire inoltre che, grazie all'apporto di molti Gruppi, il piano di comunicazione aziendale e di trasparenza viene proposto dall'amministratore delegato, ma viene approvato dal consiglio d'amministrazione. Lo voglio ribadire con forza. <p> In secondo luogo, si dice che c'è un problema costituzionale a proposito della formazione del consiglio d'amministrazione. Ebbene, quattro membri del consiglio d'amministrazione vengono votati dal Parlamento: questo vuole la Costituzione, e queste sono state le osservazioni fatte. Essi non sono nominati dal Governo, ma dal Parlamento. Quindi c'è una piena parlamentarizzazione, perché si tratta di quattro su sette, e uno addirittura viene nominato dai dipendenti. L'azionista di maggioranza non nomina, ma suggerisce l'amministratore delegato e il presidente al consiglio di amministrazione; questi vengono eletti e votati dal consiglio di amministrazione stesso. Credo pertanto che non esista alcun vulnus su questo punto. Un altro aspetto che molti colleghi hanno evidenziato è quello degli appalti. Qualcuno giustamente ha sollevato lo scandalo delle tangenti pagate: vorrei ricordare che quei 38 milioni di euro sono stati portati alla luce dall' audit interna. Cioè all'interno della RAI funziona un servizio, il quale ha fornito questi dati alla magistratura, che sta intervenendo (vedremo come andrà a finire). Quindi oggi esiste (e domani esisterà ancora di più) un sistema di audit interna che controllerà gli appalti. Sottolineo che gli appalti che non verranno sottoposti alle norme del codice sono soltanto quelli che riguardano la programmazione, i tempi di trasmissione, insomma la parte artistica, perché su questi riteniamo che la RAI debba avere la possibilità di agire immediatamente e di poter acquisire programmi e trasmissioni in tempi molto rapidi. Ricordo comunque che il limite per l'amministratore delegato è fissato in 10 milioni di euro. Tutti gli atti e i contratti che siano di importo superiore a 10 milioni di euro dovranno essere sottoposti all'approvazione del consiglio di amministrazione. Inoltre in questo disegno di legge il conflitto di interessi è stato elevato ad una maggiore attenzione. Oltre a questo, vorrei anche rispondere ad alcuni colleghi che hanno evidenziato un altro punto fondamentale. Ringrazio la senatrice Bernini, perché i suoi interventi sono sempre molto illuminati e io li seguo con grande attenzione. Io rispetto molto le prerogative di questo Parlamento, senatrice Bernini. Lei giustamente ha chiesto perché la regolamentazione del canone non sia stata inserita in questa legge. Senatrice, il Parlamento è sovrano: era in questo disegno di legge, in quanto il Governo ce l'aveva inserita ma, siccome il Parlamento è sovrano, quella parte è stata bocciata dal Parlamento. Quindi il Governo ha ripreso il problema del canone e l'ha inserito all'interno del disegno di legge di stabilità. Più parlamentarizzazione di questa, cosa dobbiamo fare per far sì che la RAI abbia veramente la possibilità di essere competitiva? Per finire, nessuna tassa in Italia è stata tagliata del 17 per cento, perché il canone è stato diminuito del 17 per cento. Perché continuiamo a dire che il canone è una tassa? Il canone si pagherà per 100 euro, distribuiti in dieci o cinque mesi, a seconda se si paga la bolletta mensile o bimestrale. Quindi c'è stata una diminuzione del canone. Poi, se vogliamo dire che dobbiamo favorire l'evasione del canone, su questo oggettivamente non sono d'accordo, perché penso che tutti debbano pagare il canone. Tra l'altro, ricordo che il canone che si paga in Italia è il più basso d'Europa (100 euro). Quindi io credo che sia stato fatto un buon lavoro. Qualcuno dice che questa non è una riforma generale della RAI. Guardate che il fatto di dire che ci vuole sempre ben altro è un problema del nostro Paese; il benaltrismo è uno sport molto seguito. Io credo che noi possiamo partire da questa riforma della governance e da questa riforma della gestione della RAI per dire che avremo finalmente una RAI moderna, pronta con i tempi e pronta ad affrontare non solo il mercato, ma anche tutte le innovazioni tecnologiche che il futuro ci porterà.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5232416987419128, 0.47675830125808716]}, {'sequence': \"Esprimo parere contrario sull'ordine del giorno G1.301 e favorevole sugli ordini del giorno G1.292 e G1.304.

Ha ragione il collega Luigi Marino quando dice che io ho ritirato il mio emendamento per aderire all'emendamento 4.19 (testo 4), ma quest'ultimo non è l'emendamento presentato dal senatore Santini.

Sono l'impegno vivo di un grande Paese, qual è il nostro, nel tentativo di stabilizzare le aree di crisi del mondo e di intervenire a sostegno delle popolazioni che si trovano in una condizione di difficoltà. Non c'è nessun rituale nell'impegno di migliaia di nostri militari che ogni giorno riempiono d'orgoglio e dovrebbero riempire d'orgoglio il nostro Paese per l'azione che stanno facendo. <p> Così come non è rituale il fatto che, anche con questo provvedimento, decidiamo di spostare una quota di militari a protezione della diga di Mossul e a sostegno del contingente già presente e dell'azienda italiana che è chiamata a operare per consolidare quella infrastruttura. Se sono vere le proiezioni delle Nazioni Unite, in caso di un malaugurato crollo di quella diga o di un incidente sarebbero davvero centinaia di migliaia le vittime. Ma soprattutto si creerebbe una condizione di mancanza d'acqua per un'intera area che comprende 200 milioni di persone, e si verificherebbe una delle più grandi catastrofi umanitarie. <p> Ma non solo per questo siamo lì; siamo lì anche per affermare il fatto che quella diga, che è un prodotto dell'ingegneria e del talento italiano, è uno degli interventi che l'Italia fa all'estero dimostrando il proprio livello imprenditoriale, tecnologico e il proprio grande livello culturale. E parte di questo intervento di natura imprenditoriale e tecnologico vede anche l'impegno dello Stato a sostegno delle imprese che intervengono e a sostegno di una grande necessità umanitaria. Noi dobbiamo essere alla diga di Mosul e dobbiamo rafforzare il nostro contingente militare. <p> Così come credo che dobbiamo essere impegnati - l'abbiamo già detto più volte in questa sede - per la stabilizzazione della situazione in Libia. La situazione in Libia è in forte evoluzione. Da pochi mesi si è insediato un Governo con non poche difficoltà: alcuni Ministeri hanno cominciato a insediarsi nella capitale, ma è ancora necessario che questa autorità si affermi in quel Paese. <p> Ebbene, questa stabilizzazione è necessaria e fondamentale per riuscire anche a far evolvere la nostra politica nel Mediterraneo e la politica verso i profughi che ci sono nel Mediterraneo. Devo dire che ho sentito cose curiose oggi, compreso il fatto che le persone che affondano sui barconi sarebbero i ricchi che vengono dall'Africa e che possono permettersi il viaggio. Cose che sarebbero curiose se non avessero in sé un profilo di difficoltà a comprendere un processo che non è soltanto verso l'Italia e non coinvolge solo il nostro Paese ma è un processo globale che vede lo spostamento di interi popoli e che certamente non possiamo affrontare da soli, ma con una maggiore convergenza con l'Europa e le altre grandi potenze mondiali. <p> La stabilizzazione della Libia è un fatto assolutamente fondamentale così come è fondamentale che vi sia il presidio del mare non per un doveroso salvataggio dei naufraghi - perché salvare i naufraghi è ciò che si deve fare quando ci sono dei naufraghi - bensì perché presidiare il Mediterraneo, avere i nostri contingenti militari a presidio del Mediterraneo, è ciò che si deve fare quando si vuole essere una potenza che vuole recitare un ruolo europeo e un ruolo mondiale. <p> Abbiamo anche presentato un emendamento - simbolico è vero, lo voglio dire perché ne riparleremo - che riguarda la fornitura di ricambi per aeroplani all'Egitto. È - ripeto - un emendamento assolutamente simbolico, un segnale che il Parlamento vuole dare al Governo, che si rimette peraltro al Parlamento, perché non può passare in secondo piano la dolorosissima vicenda che ha visto anche quest'Assemblea impegnata a chiedere al Governo egiziano di fare chiarezza e di dare supporto alla nostra magistratura sulla vicenda dell'omicidio violentissimo del giovane Regeni, avvenuto in Egitto. Certo che è una vicenda che ha profili oscuri ma non è una vicenda dalla quale facciamo derivare un mutamento di atteggiamento nei confronti dell'Egitto che sappiamo bene essere una potenza impegnata contro il terrorismo, un grande Paese arabo complesso, sappiamo bene essere un Paese che con noi ha molti collegamenti; e sappiamo bene che proprio in virtù dall'amicizia che ci ha legato a questo Paese noi abbiamo bisogno che su una vicenda come questa vi sia chiarezza. Dare un segnale simbolico forte è una cosa, dire che piuttosto sarebbe meglio rompere le relazioni economiche con l'Egitto è tutt'altro genere di considerazione e non era affatto nella nostra intenzione proporre corbellerie di questo tipo. Con l'Egitto abbiamo relazioni e rapporti molto intensi ma i rapporti tra due grandi Paesi si qualificano anche se questi si rispettano. Un Paese che si è smentito più volte su questa vicenda piuttosto complessa deve consentire alle nostre autorità, insieme alle loro, di fare piena luce su di essa. <p> Dentro le missioni c'è la nostra politica estera, dentro la nostra politica estera c'è l'atteggiamento di un Paese che è un medio Paese mondiale ma che nella politica internazionale ricopre un ruolo di primo piano. D'altra parte la nostra posizione strategica, la condizione economica e la posizione di ponte tra il Mediterraneo e l'Europa, tra l'Occidente e l'Islam ci impone, oggi come in passato, di essere un punto di collegamento tra mondi differenti. Nelle missioni militari c'è questa funzione. Anch'io sono dell'idea - sebbene non sia di mia competenza questo problema - che dovremmo affrontarlo, così come abbiamo fatto al Senato e alla Camera, con una legge quadro sulle missioni militari che ci consenta di definire con una programmazione stabile del Governo, il nostro impegno nell'intervento militare come parte della nostra politica estera. <p> Questo è quello che dovremmo fare dall'anno prossimo ma già quest'anno l'intervento è sull'intera annualità e non per i prossimi sei mesi, com'era di solito. È già una programmazione più lunga nel tempo. È un passo avanti che il Parlamento ha condiviso assieme al Governo e che io credo che questo decreto-legge, che mette in campo le nostre missioni, stia confermando sia nella logica che negli obiettivi e negli intendimenti, sia nelle pratiche che si stanno attuando, sia nella serietà con cui ci comportiamo nella politica militare così come nella politica internazionale.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5896900296211243, 0.41030991077423096]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> LATORRE (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, credo che non debba essere in alcun modo rituale il tempo, pur breve, che noi stiamo dedicando a questo avvenimento, e non solo - mi permetta di sottolineare questo aspetto, nella discussione finora sfuggito - perché è doveroso che le nostre istituzioni manifestino tutta la loro vicinanza innanzitutto alla famiglia di Giovanni Lo Porto, alla sua mamma, al suo papà e ai suoi fratelli. <p> Ma anche perché Giovanni ha vissuto un'intera vita dedicandosi agli altri sino al sacrificio, e lo ha fatto così come fanno tanti italiani che in queste ore, mentre noi siamo qui, sono impegnati in diverse forme in tutto il mondo a rendere onore al nostro Paese e a farci sentire orgogliosi di essere italiani. <p> Avremo modo di discutere su questa vicenda in occasione delle comunicazioni che il Governo renderà in Parlamento, anche perché è il Governo il soggetto politico con il quale bisognerà interloquire.

É una riforma che esprime e richiede innovazione, più territorio, più Europa, maggiore snellezza e velocità decisionale, maggiore incremento di efficienza, più credibilità e alleggerimento della macchina burocratica dentro, e non fuori dal processo democratico, come richiede un Paese moderno. La portata della riforma viene da alcune parti svilita nei suoi obiettivi portanti. Non comporta una diminutio della democrazia, ma intende al contrario mettere le nostre istituzioni democratiche in grado di decidere, in un più corretto rapporto istituzionale ed interistituzionale, come prima ben evidenziava la senatrice Lanzillotta. Il superamento del bicameralismo era frutto di un dibattito politico già presente in forme diverse ben prima del <PARTY>, fin dal 1996, e quindi nelle tesi dell'Ulivo, in particolare nella tesi n. 4, che prevedeva un superamento del bicameralismo paritario con un Senato delle autonomie durante il Governo Prodi (prima lo citava la senatrice Favero). Quanto, quindi, si propone con la riforma del Senato è nient'altro che ciò che la Sinistra aveva già ipotizzato, prefigurato, proposto nel passato, e che non era mai arrivato ad un punto di compimento. Quanto oggi cerchiamo di realizzare e a cui cerchiamo di dare risposta è atteso da trentatre anni. Oggi, quindi, dopo ben 134 emendamenti approvati da Camera e Senato, dopo revisioni di Commissioni e di costituzionalisti, siamo ad un punto di arrivo. È tutto sotto il sole, all'interno di un processo democratico. La caduta libera della memoria storica sembra aver appannato o travolto più di qualcuno. Perché mai, mi chiedo, una riforma delle funzioni del Senato, un cambio di modello costituzionale rispondente ad una visione più ampiamente territoriale ed europea, dovrebbe lasciare inalterato e uguale a se stesso (copia conforme) il sistema regolamentare elettivo, immodificabile a priori, indipendentemente dalle finalità? Perché non dovrebbe essere legittimato il fatto che la seconda Camera, in un bicameralismo differenziato, sia rappresentanza delle autonomie, delle istituzioni territoriali e siano le autonomie stesse, le istituzioni territoriali ad individuare i propri rappresentanti a livello dei futuri senatori, con diverse funzioni? Perché la votazione diretta sarebbe più democratica rispetto a quella indiretta in una realtà istituzionale diversa, in una dialettica tra Regioni in un futuro Senato? Cito al riguardo l'interessante intervento svolto ieri dal collega Cociancich. Secondo quale a priori ? L'elezione diretta darebbe forse maggiore legittimazione ad una Camera elettiva rappresentativa delle autonomie, e perché? Sarebbe un contrappeso? Bene si è espressa Anna Finocchiaro, e quindi non oso fare delle considerazioni in aggiunta, perché non ne ho assolutamente le competenze. Ma la mia sottolineatura si incentra su qual è il fondamento, qual è il senso, essendo le realtà e le finalità delle due Camere differenziate. Avviene nei vari modelli di democrazia - come ha richiamato prima il senatore Maran - nel modello tedesco, francese e del Regno Unito, in cui la seconda Camera non ha una elezione diretta. Il Governo ha avuto più coraggio degli altri, ha voluto cambiare. Al sistema dei ridondanti contrappesi intende rispondere con l'alleggerimento dei pesi, a volte zavorre che rallentano il sistema Paese. La gente si aspetta risultati, non arcaismi che non aiutano a costruire, non danno un valore aggiunto in termini di democrazia, ma reiterano schemi che rallentano i processi di cambiamento e di innovazione democratica. Quanto ai sistemi di controllo e di garanzia, il nostro sistema è democratico. Mettono in sicurezza il parlamentarismo varie istituzioni di garanzia: la Corte costituzionale, il Capo dello Stato con funzione di garante della democrazia, i referendum, la magistratura inquirente, la Corte costituzionale, i TAR, le autonomie regionali. Siamo chiamati a nuove ed importanti responsabilità. Assumiamoci quella di mettere in atto un processo di crescita e un cambio di passo necessario nel superamento di un modello costituzionale di cui, da tanti anni, viene da più parti invocato il rinnovamento, messo in discussione con irrigidimenti che vorrebbero impedire il superamento del bicameralismo paritario. Mi auguro che tali irrigidimenti siano ampiamente superabili in un clima di responsabilità e condivisione politica, dentro una riforma democratica necessaria al Paese, in una strada che conduca ad un Senato rappresentativo delle autonomie, nell'obiettivo di un avanzamento della democrazia governante; avanzamento che non va sprecato ma valorizzato per soluzioni che guardino al futuro del Paese.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5183650851249695, 0.4816349744796753]}, {'sequence': 'Signora Presidente, quando gli storici di diritto costituzionale studieranno questa revisione noteranno un\\'anomalia che noi non possiamo, oppure non vogliamo, vedere. Con i voti di un premio di maggioranza viziato da illegittimità, si riscrive quasi tutta la seconda parte della Costituzione. La Corte raccomandò di approvare subito la legge elettorale per andare a votare al più presto, non chiese di riscrivere la Carta. Lo fa la classe politica proprio per evitare le elezioni. <p> So di dire una cosa che suona sgradevole e quasi me ne scuso. Sembra che vi sia, quasi inconsapevolmente, un accordo per non parlarne, che la dice lunga sullo straniamento di questo dibattito. Si cambia la forma di governo del Paese, senza annunciarla, senza discuterla come tale e senza neppure deliberarla esplicitamente. Si istituisce il premierato assoluto, come lo chiamava, con tremore di giurista, Leopoldo Elia. Lo definiva \"assoluto\" non perché fosse una svolta autoritaria - come si dice oggi - ma perché privo dei contrappesi, cioè di quei meccanismi compensativi che sono in grado di trasformare ogni potere in democrazia. <p> Qui si affidano le sorti del Paese all\\'arbitrio di una minoranza che diventa maggioranza per i rinforzi artificiali e non per i consensi dei cittadini. Si crea un governo maggioritario in una democrazia minoritaria, segnata da una disaffezione elettorale che arriva alla metà della popolazione. <p> Un leader che raccoglie meno di un terzo dei consensi conquista il banco, è in grado di governare da solo - e fin qui si può accettare - ma può anche modificare le regole fondamentali con spirito di parte, senza essere costretto a discuterne con gli altri. Per tutto ciò il Premier dispone di una maggioranza ubbidiente di parlamentari che ha scelto personalmente come capilista. Al contrario egli riceve un\\'investitura diretta, seppure minoritaria, nel ballottaggio. Si crea così uno squilibrio di legittimazione tra il Premier e l\\'Assemblea, che si traduce in supremazia del potere esecutivo sopra il legislativo e indirettamente anche sull\\'ordinamento giudiziario. I tre poteri fondamentali di una democrazia sono decisamente fuori equilibrio. Il principale squilibrio è nel numero dei deputati, che crea di fatto un monocameralismo: niente di male, in linea di principio, lo proponeva con ardore il mio caro maestro, il presidente Pietro Ingrao, come pure tanti altri nella Prima Repubblica, ma nessuno di loro lo avrebbe mai accettato con una legge ipermaggioritaria. Eppure, eliminare lo squilibrio numerico sarebbe facile: in nessun Paese europeo si arriva a seicentotrenya deputati e la proposta iniziale del Governo poneva la riduzione dei parlamentari come priorità. Perché allora non si riduce il numero dei deputati? Perché si cambia tutto, tranne che il numero dei componenti della Camera? Da più di un anno questa domanda rimane senza risposta. Mi rivolgo in extremis alla ministra Boschi, che spero abbia almeno la cortesia domani, in sede di replica, di dare a quest\\'Aula una spiegazione seria e convincente sul punto. Il risultato è un Senato senza funzioni e senza autorevolezza: ma allora è meglio eliminarlo del tutto. <p> Non c\\'è niente di peggio che un\\'Assemblea senza poteri, con il rischio che li ottenga indirettamente, con il consociativismo con il Governo, degradando ulteriormente la trasparenza e l\\'efficienza del sistema. Non rinnego il Senato elettivo a base proporzionale, rimango convinto che fosse una buona proposta il \"Senato di garanzia\", come lo abbiamo chiamato, per i poteri e per il mandato elettorale diretto, ma non mi innamoro delle proposte. In teoria, la garanzia si può ottenere anche in una sola Camera, magari eletta con i collegi uninominali, ricorrendo a voti qualificati superiori al premio di maggioranza nella legislazione dei diritti fondamentali. È dirimente l\\'equilibrio generale, non la singola proposta, neppure quella a me cara del Senato elettivo. La legislazione costituzionale non è altro che produzione di sistema. La qualità di una legge costituzionale si misura dall\\'effetto di sistema e qui la misura è negativa, sotto tutti i punti di vista. Neppure la mediazione che si affaccia sulla quasi elezione dei senatori - un passo in avanti certamente positivo, che apprezzo - è in grado di modificare l\\'impianto né riduce lo squilibrio del premierato assoluto e cancella la mia personale valutazione negativa. <p> Si è persa l\\'occasione della riforma del bicameralismo, raccontando un falso all\\'opinione pubblica. Non è vero che ci sia un problema di velocità, anzi, è vero il contrario: è troppo facile fare le leggi; si approvano in modo bulimico, approvando una legge prima che quella precedente abbia il tempo di essere applicata. Lo sanno bene i cittadini, le amministrazioni e le imprese, che sono ormai sommerse da un\\'alluvione normativa. Il nuovo bicameralismo dovrebbe aumentare la qualità e non la velocità, per produrre poche leggi organiche, brevi e leggibili anche dai cittadini. A questo compito di alta legislazione doveva recarsi il nuovo Senato, per curare i grandi codici, lasciando poi alla Camera di attuare il programma di Governo entro una cornice solida ed efficace. <p> Non si è potuto neppure discuterne, perché c\\'è il feticcio del Senato federale. Era una grande idea, certo, dell\\'Ulivo e di tanti altri: molti di noi, me compreso, hanno speso le migliori energie giovanili per una Repubblica federale, ma questo disegno si è rivelato disastroso. Le Regioni oggi sono al punto più basso di credibilità, come si vede dalla partecipazione al voto. Si sarebbe dovuto fare un bilancio qui, in Parlamento, di questa discussione ventennale, ma il Governo l\\'ha fatto da solo, togliendo il potere alle Regioni e compensando il ceto politico con il pennacchio al Senato. <p> Bisognerebbe invece ridurre il numero delle Regioni: ho presentato un emendamento su questo, perché una decina di macroregioni potrebbero trovare un rapporto proficuo con lo Stato e renderebbero più compatto sistema Paese nella competizione internazionale. <p> Lo scorso anno ho espresso insieme ad altri il mio disagio non partecipando al voto. Sperando che nei passaggi successivi si potesse migliorare: l\\'equilibrio, a mio avviso, è peggiorato. Il passo avanti sul Senato elettivo è vanificato dall\\'approvazione dell\\'Italicum e dal diniego della riduzione del numero dei deputati. <p> Alla seconda deliberazione siamo chiamati ad una valutazione definitiva. Per questo il mio voto sarà contrario, non essendoci, in materia costituzionale, un vincolo di partito. <p> Sento già il ritornello: ma allora vuoi far cadere il Governo? È una domanda stupida, che si legge tutti i giornali. <p> È una strabiliante inversione tra causa ed effetto. <p> È inaudito che il Governo ponga in sede politica una sorta di fiducia sul cambiamento della Costituzione. Non è mai accaduto nella storia della Repubblica. Che oggi venga considerato normale, che si dia quasi per scontato, che venga messo all\\'indice chi si sottrae è la conferma che il dibattito pubblico italiano è malato; che già nell\\'agenda di discussione, prima ancora che nelle soluzioni, si vede un pericoloso sbandamento di principi e di valori. <p> Si è costruita artificiosamente un\\'emergenza costituzionale per conferire una legittimazione politica a un Governo sprovvisto di un diretto mandato degli elettori. È l\\'ennesima anomalia italiana. In un Paese normale il Governo non si occupa della Costituzione. In un Paese normale l\\'Esecutivo governa secondo un programma presentato agli elettori. Si può derogare a queste semplici regole in situazioni straordinarie e per breve tempo; da noi lo stato d\\'eccezione durerà per quasi tutto questo decennio. Non si può dare la colpa solo agli ultimi venuti. Da vent\\'anni si cambia la Costituzione per finalità politiche: prima il Centrosinistra col Titolo V, poi Berlusconi nel 2005, Fini con lo ius sanguinis del voto all\\'estero, i tentativi di Tremonti sull\\'articolo 41. Tutte riforme costituzionali fallite, perché sbagliato era il metodo. Ma già negli anni \\'80, quando i partiti hanno perso la capacità di governo del Paese, hanno preso il vezzo di dire che non era colpa loro, ma della Costituzione. Per non affrontare la crisi della politica hanno aperto una crisi delle istituzioni; hanno cominciato a sfogliare l\\'atlante dei modelli francese, inglese, americano, spagnolo, tedesco. Ma il perfettismo istituzionale è un sintomo della malattia della politica; le Costituzioni sane sono imperfette perché prodotte dalla storia. Il modello decisionale americano è pazzesco; è privo del decreto-legge, eppure ha governato un impero.

Signor Presidente, mi scuso con i colleghi per questa incursione in un provvedimento che non ho seguito in Commissione. Vorrei dire però che l'attribuzione di falso al relatore da parte del collega Marton, potrei replicarla con un'accusa di falso al senatore Santangelo. Quando infatti il senatore Santangelo ha protestato contro l'emendamento 4.200 delle Commissioni riunite ha esplicitamente fatto riferimento alla circostanza secondo cui in questo emendamento si sarebbe autorizzata la cessione a titolo gratuito alla Somalia di armamenti. Questo è falso. È falso, perché l'emendamento prevede, oltre ai famosi strumenti musicali, la cessione di quattro autovetture munite di sistema di monitoraggio e tracciamento delle reti di telefonia mobile, che sono quelle adoperate dalle nostre forze di polizia anche per le intercettazioni telefoniche e ambientali. Peraltro, la questione non è non cedere alla Somalia alcun tipo di bene, salvo ovviamente gli armamenti di cui all'emendamento citato adesso dal collega Marton; tanto è vero che l'emendamento 4.2, dei senatori Bertorotta, Lucidi, Santangelo e Marton, precedente all'emendamento 4.200, prevedeva la proposta del <PARTY> di cedere alla Repubblica federale di Somalia a titolo gratuito apparecchiature medicali, non meglio identificate, e quattro natanti tipo gommone. Quindi di armi non si trattava né nell'emendamento 4.2 del <PARTY>, né nell'emendamento 4.200 delle Commissioni riunite. <p> Questa è la verità, poi si è deciso di ritirare l'emendamento, ma almeno ristabiliamo, anche per una correttezza nei confronti dei cittadini a cui il senatore Santangelo si è rivolto e che non hanno il fascicolo degli emendamenti davanti, la verità dei fatti. <p> AIROLA (<PARTY>).

Se lo chiede un esponente così autorevole di maggioranza, figuriamoci noi della minoranza ed i cittadini italiani. Ecco, questa è la trasparenza del Governo Conte. <p> Il PNR, sezione terza del DEF, abitualmente viene proposto e presentato assieme ai programmi di stabilità, sezione prima e seconda del DEF che è il documento contenente le analisi e la tendenze della finanza pubblica. Il PNR, quest'anno, causa pandemia Covid-19, è stato esposto dopo l'approvazione delle risoluzioni di Camera e Senato sul DEF. A tale proposito è importante sottolineare che l'Italia è l'unico Paese europeo che non ha presentato alla Commissione il proprio Piano nazionale delle riforme secondo i tempi stabiliti. <p> Gli argomenti riportati nel documento riguardano il cuneo fiscale sul lavoro che è troppo elevato. L'accumularsi nel corso del tempo della disparità di trattamento tra le diverse fonti di reddito e l'esorbitante complessità del sistema sono temi del tutto veritieri ma non unici perché nel momento storico in cui viviamo, la questione della tassazione è palese a tutti. Nel programma si parla anche di evasione fiscale e si enumerano varie soluzioni tra le quali la più nota è quella di una progressiva riduzione del pagamento in contante con conseguente diffusione dei pagamenti elettronici, con grandi favori alle banche e aumento dei costi per cittadini e attività imprenditoriali. <p> L'utilizzo del contante, specie nel settore del commercio, ha sempre rappresentato un valido e pratico strumento. Non ha alcun senso accanirsi sull'idea che se scompare il denaro contante, sparisce di pari passo l'evasione fiscale. Dalle audizioni fatte in Commissione finanze in merito ai rapporti di conto corrente, si evince che i grandi evasori fiscali e la criminalità procedono infatti tranquillamente e in modo illecito con i pagamenti elettronici utilizzando criptovalute e che la maggior parte dell'evasione dei capitali avviene tramite falsificazioni contabili e non con denaro contante. <p> L'economia del nostro Paese è rappresentata da lavoratori autonomi, professionisti e partite IVA ai quali va tesa una mano considerando che la crisi la vivono direttamente sulla loro pelle. Per queste categorie è necessaria una netta presa di posizione che preveda la semplificazione degli adempimenti IRPEF e IVA e una revisione degli incassi effettivi e presunti, dando un colpo di spugna a monte dell'infernale sistema del saldo e dell'acconto. <p> In tal senso la Lega sta apportando il proprio contributo con un disegno di legge presentato alcuni giorni fa che prevede, fra le altre cose, l'eliminazione delle inefficienze e i limiti che caratterizzano l'attuale sistema di compensazione di crediti e debiti vantati verso le pubbliche amministrazioni, introducendo al tempo stesso uno strumento innovativo per accelerarne e semplificarne l'attuazione. <p> Per quanto riguarda la flat tax,la Lega il 29 maggio scorso ha presentato un disegno di legge. In buona sostanza si mira ad una vera e nuova riforma fiscale con al centro il contribuente che non deve essere vessato da adempimenti e burocrazia. Solamente dando certezza e stabilità alle regole fiscali, alleggerendo tutto il sistema, si può migliorare il rapporto tra contribuenti e amministrazione finanziaria, riacquistando quella fiducia nello Stato che è il fondamentale presupposto per una vera crescita e competitività del Paese. <p> Concludo il mio intervento con una riflessione sul tema del differenzialismo regionale. Un tema che seppure affrontato non riscuote le simpatie di questa maggioranza giallorossa, in quanto si percepisce la volontà di non dare risposte ai cittadini veneti e lombardi che si sono espressi chiaramente con un referendum. Sono trascorsi più di mille giorni dalla consultazione che possiamo anche definire un plebiscito in Veneto, ma c'è silenzio assordante o forse un disinteresse ancor più grave, perché calpesta la volontà dei cittadini. Non solo Veneto e Lombardia chiedono risposte su questo argomento, ma altre Regioni hanno reclamato l'attuazione del regionalismo differenziato. Il Governo soffre di grave sordità e non dimostra interesse non solo verso i problemi dei cittadini, ma anche degli enti locali e delle istituzioni. Il Governo è capace solo di redigere documenti e approvarli a suo uso e consumo, come la proroga dello stato di emergenza, ma di tutto quanto è fuori del Palazzo, cittadini, quotidianità, lavoratori, mondo imprenditoriale, scuola e sanità, non se ne cura minimamente, dimostrando un disinteresse incredibile e una confusione imbarazzante.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5796229839324951, 0.42037704586982727]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> SANGALLI (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghe e colleghi, rappresentanti del Governo, devo dire che anche l'ultimo intervento del senatore Faraone mi sembra un po' di quelli della serie: lo voto, ma non è colpa mia, perché l'avevano fatto gli altri. Questo è accaduto durante la discussione generale ed anche adesso in dichiarazione di voto. Se le cose si condividono si votano, altrimenti no, ma comunque questa è ormai l'impronta di questo nuovo Governo, che al primo provvedimento pone la prima questione di fiducia. Voglio anche dire al senatore Laforgia, che adesso non vedo in Aula, che anche noi siamo molto incuriositi dalle nuovo forme di lavoro, ma devo dire che è abbastanza stucchevole il fatto che, quando dei ragazzi sono venuti in Commissione a dire la loro, se dicono qualcosa che non va bene a questo Governo sono eteroguidati. Ho avuto l'impressione - dal momento i ragazzi che sono venuti in Commissione si erano divisi in due fazioni, quattro in prima fila e quattro in seconda, con gli eteroguidati in prima fila - che quelli della seconda fila fossero sindacatoguidati. Siccome ho un grande interesse verso le forme di lavoro, mi sarebbe piaciuto discutere sulle tutele, che nessuno di noi aveva in mente di non concedere perché è corretto che siano date maggiori tutele a questi lavoratori. C'era la proposta di fare un tavolo per approfondire meglio queste nuove forme di lavoro ed invece si è pensato bene di ingabbiare questa nuova forma di lavoro, inserendo nella legge il termine piattaforme digitali. Credo dovremmo discutere tantissimo tempo su cosa sia una piattaforma digitale. La strada che si è scelta è questa. Abbiamo ascoltato un uomo di quarantatré anni che aveva appena avuto un insuccesso con un'attività commerciale e a quarantatré anni e tre figli si è messo sulla bicicletta, riuscendo con dignità a mantenere la propria famiglia. È stato citato il cottimo; i ragazzi, a dir la verità, in Commissione non hanno chiesto il cottimo, ma di valutare la meritocrazia. Visioni della vita completamente diverse. Mi piaceva comunque far sapere al senatore Laforgia che anche da questa parte dell'Assemblea c'è qualcuno che si interessa dei lavoratori, che lo ha sempre fatto e che non è sicuramente una caratteristica esclusiva della sinistra. <p> Una cosa che ci sta particolarmente a cuore come <PARTY> è l'inammissibilità dei nostri emendamenti, quelli del senatore Balboni fra i tanti identici a quelli presentati in fase di approvazione del reddito di cittadinanza. Concordo col senatore Martelli sul fatto che ieri il relatore, senatore Girotto, ci ha dato una lezione di vita spiegandoci l'immenso mondo delle ragioni per cui non potevamo presentare tali emendamenti, dicendo che non rientravano né nel reddito di cittadinanza, né all'interno del provvedimento al nostro esame. Leggo solamente una parte della relazione allegata al provvedimento in cui si dice «conseguentemente si dispone l'abrogazione dell'articolo 12, comma 4, del decreto-legge 28 gennaio 2019, convertito, con modificazioni, dalla legge 28 marzo 2019, n. 26», che è quella del reddito di cittadinanza. Quindi non sollecitato, ma lo si è modificato. Questa è però ormai l'Assemblea dell'ipocrisia perché quando è successo il caso Saraceni si sono stracciati tutte le vesti e hanno detto che avrebbero provveduto e sarebbero intervenuti perché non doveva più accadere. Di fatto non sono intervenuti, non hanno fatto niente e non ci hanno nemmeno permesso di poterlo fare noi e mettere fine al reddito di cittadinanza, ai delinquenti, agli stupratori e ai terroristi. Credo che questa sia veramente la dimostrazione dell'ipocrisia del Governo. <p> L'aspetto buono del decreto-legge, che all'inizio non c'era, è la stabilizzazione dei precari ANPAL. Una storia lunghissima. Ho ascoltato i colleghi del <PARTY> sottolineare la realizzazione di tale misura con toni di vittoria. La cosa carina è che i primi pareri che c'erano arrivati dal Governo su un emendamento che avevo presentato assieme alla senatrice Garnero Santanchè e un emendamento della senatrice Parente su tale stabilizzazione, erano contrari. Poi, - miracoli della vita - con la trattativa lunghissima che ha visto nuovamente la commedia dei continui rinvii delle Commissioni, si diceva solo che si aspettavano le coperture, ma in realtà se le stavano dando di santa ragione <p> per poi arrivare ai risultati che abbiamo visto con l'emendamento che sostituisce tutto il decreto-legge e sul quale è stata apposta la fiducia. Forse perché riconoscere dei meriti alla destra diventa un problema per cui il parere è negativo sulle nostre proposte e, poi, nella notte si cambiano i pareri. <p> Un'altra cosa che in questi giorni ho sentito dire è che all'interno del provvedimento c'era un emendamento giusto che proponeva di togliere la definizione Ministero della famiglia e della disabilità; un Ministero che il Governo, appena arrivato, ha tolto. Ciò che più mi ha lasciato attonito è che qualcuno, non ricordo chi, ha detto che le associazioni del mondo della disabilità sono contente che non ci sia più questo Ministero. <p> Ho la presunzione di conoscere per tanti motivi il mondo della disabilità e non ho mai trovato nessuno contento perché, quando è stato istituito, molti del mondo della disabilità avevano detto che finalmente un Ministero specifico si sarebbe occupato delle loro problematiche, anche perché, spesso e volentieri, dei disabili ci si ricorda in campagna elettorale, e poi si vedrà. <p> Credo quindi che questo provvedimento sia stato veramente stravolto in alcuni punti perché - ripeto - è stato frutto di una trattativa fra le tante; un decreto-legge che, come ho detto all'inizio, ha posto la maggioranza all'interno del gioco delle distinzioni: questo va bene perché siamo intervenuti noi, ma l'altra parte è stata fatta dal Governo giallo-verde, quindi su quello, per carità, dobbiamo fare diversamente, quindi ne prendiamo le distanze pur votando a favore. <p> Veniamo alle crisi aziendali perché in questi giorni abbiamo parlato solo di Whirlpool e Ilva, ma ci siamo dimenticati degli oltre 160 tavoli aperti; ci siamo dimenticati dei lavoratori della Mercatone Uno, dei lavoratori della Bluetec, appesi alla decisione di nomina di un amministratore straordinario. Ci siamo dimenticati delle tante parole che il ministro Di Maio aveva detto sulla Whirlpool, rassicurando i lavoratori, che dal 1° novembre di fatto sono a casa, accettando quello che oggi il proprietario della Whirlpool ci viene a raccontare, ovvero che il calo degli ordini e della produttività non giustificano lo stabilimento di Napoli, quando sappiamo tutti che nella sede Whirlpool in Slovacchia fanno turni massacranti, compresi sabato e domenica, per tenere a bada la richiesta della produzione. Quindi, l'Europa aiuta tutti i Paesi dell'Est per lo sviluppo industriale; dall'altra parte, noi ne subiamo amaramente le conseguenze. <p> Forse, al di là dell'intervento del ministro Patuanelli - anch'io mi associo alle tante parole di stima di questi giorni - al di là della passione con cui ha esposto la situazione nel suo intervento di ieri, non ho rilevato un'idea di come andremo a finire con le crisi aziendali, ovvero la posizione del Governo nel merito, soprattutto per l'idea di un Paese nuovo che, come è stato ricordato, è composto da una popolazione che ha sempre avuto voglia di lavorare, di emergere, che è sempre stata avanti in termini di creatività e capacità del lavoro. <p> Siamo veramente poco fiduciosi e molto speranzosi che andiate a casa il più presto possibile. <p> Per tutte le motivazioni esposte, chiaramente il Gruppo <PARTY> non potrà mai votare una fiducia a questo Governo. <p> A cartello non si risponde con cartello ma con qualche espulsione, vero, senatore Barbaro?\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5583981275558472, 0.4416019022464752]}, {'sequence': 'Signor Ministro, quindi, secondo il suo emendamento, il suo abnorme emendamento, che non distingue tra sentenza assolutoria e sentenza di condanna, io e migliaia di italiani come me, usciti dopo interminabili e infernali anni dalla gabbia giudiziaria in modo assolutamente innocente (e sottolineo, in modo assolutamente innocente), saremmo ancora prigionieri <p> di una pendenza teoricamente infinita. <p> Ma non solo.

Signor Presidente, la segretezza dà alla testa! Grazie per avermi concesso la parola, signor Presidente. Nell'assoluto rispetto del dibattito, credo che dovremmo prendere in prestito una locuzione usata dal senatore Romano: almeno qui dentro, siamo amici morali. Credo che, dunque, dovremmo evitare rappresentazioni di vissuti molto complicati, come se tutto potesse ridursi alla rappresentazione di persone che non aspettano altro che ammazzarsi e suicidarsi e di professionisti e familiari che non aspettano altro che spegnere vite in bilico: non è proprio così. Signor Presidente, la difficoltà del disegno di legge in esame sta proprio nel disegnare quel minimo di cornice giuridica per delle storie, che sono fatte di donne e uomini, che si incontrano e devono prendere decisioni complicate e che in questo investono ciò che hanno vissuto e ciò che pensano ancora di poter vivere dignitosamente: di qui il concetto di legge mite. In qualche passaggio e in qualche emendamento, che per fortuna è stato respinto, non ho visto questa idea di legge mite, ma l'idea di una normazione molto rigida, quasi una specie di sollecitazione a cure di Stato - a cure di Stato! - e ciò non va bene e non è quello che credo, anche sulla base del mio vissuto professionale, le persone desiderino. Sulla storia della nutrizione e dell'idratazione artificiali, senatore Scilipoti Isgro', ricordo che l'alimentazione è una cosa e la nutrizione è un'altra e il disegno di legge al nostro esame parla di nutrizione e non di alimentazione. Ci si può alimentare, ma nutrirsi male, ma questo vale nella vita normale e non c'è bisogno di arrivare a situazioni di questo genere. Lo ricordo perché si tratta di una discussione che ha percorso sette, otto o nove anni. Colleghi, sapete che, in qualche modo, ho guidato l'estensione di due codici di deontologia medica più volte citati in questo dibattito. Proprio nell'ultimo codice del 2014 arrivammo all'individuazione della tematica nutrizione e idratazione, incontrando io personalmente praticamente tutte le società scientifiche del settore nazionale e internazionale che si occupano di questa complessa materia. Ripeto, in alcuni contesti sono strumenti salva vita nel vero senso della parola. Pensate ai bambini che nascono con la sindrome dell'intestino corto e non hanno altra speranza che un trapianto di intestino: sopravvivono grazie a nutrizione e idratazione artificiali, nell'attesa di un trapianto che possa risolvere il problema. Pensate a grossi interventi chirurgici, soprattutto sull'apparato digerente e non solo, che nei primi venti-trenta giorni possono solo essere supportati da una terapia totalmente sostitutiva della nutrizione. Quindi, stiamo parlando di presidi sanitari a tutti gli effetti. Sono trattamenti sanitari. Dove sta la differenza? È nel contesto in cui si collocano. <p> La distinzione tra terapie e cure - che abbiamo richiamato spesso - per cui le terapie sono rivolte alla malattia e le cure alla persona, colleghi, nella moderna medicina non ha più senso. Non esiste la possibilità di fare terapie se non si cura la persona. <p> Non esistono cure senza terapie; non si può soltanto alleviare la persona senza offrirgli uno strumento ragionevole e consolidato di miglioramento, di guarigione. Questi sono gli scopi della moderna medicina: spesso guarire, ma sempre prendersi cura. Sono distinzioni vecchie quelle tra terapia e cura. Non c'è medicina se non si va incontro a quella persona, a quelle esigenze, a quella storia. <p> Da questo punto di vista ricordo bene la mozione più volte richiamata. Non ero in Senato, ma affermava una cosa giustissima, così come - fate attenzione, mi rivolgo al senatore Caliendo - la sentenza della Cassazione che rinviò al tribunale d'appello il caso Englaro. Già in quella sentenza c'era scritto che a nessuno può essere consentito di sospendere nutrizione e idratazione artificiali, perché restano solo nella disponibilità della persona. Questo diceva anche la mozione di maggioranza a cui si fa riferimento. <p> Basta andare a rileggere. Cosa vuol dire? Semplicemente che sono trattamenti medici e che a nessuno, per scelta terza, può essere consentita la sospensione, ma è un trattamento su cui intervengono solo due casi: il primo, che vada a costituire accanimento terapeutico; il secondo, quando interviene una volontà responsabile e consapevole della persona interessata.

In quest'Aula molto poco, anzi quasi per niente si è parlato di tutto quello che la Commissione bilancio ha contribuito a migliorare rispetto alle criticità che questa legge di stabilità presentava nel momento in cui è arrivata in Senato.

Sebbene non abbia concluso, ha dato comunque un segnale positivo su questa legge di stabilità; e un segnale molto positivo lo ha dato anche il lavoro del Gruppo Area Popolare: lo ha dato sulla detassazione della contrattazione di secondo livello, il cui fondo è stato reintegrato; lo ha dato sulle zone franche urbane, il cui fondo, anche in questo caso, è stato reintegrato. Un segnale importante questa legge lo dà con la chiusura delle società partecipate, perché abbiamo inserito un comma, breve ma molto eloquente, che prevede la chiusura delle società partecipate che hanno solo amministratori o che hanno più amministratori che dipendenti, per iniziare il processo di aggregazione delle società partecipate che le porterà da 8.000 a 1.000, come prevede il piano Cottarelli.

Sull'ordine dei lavori vorrei ricordare a lei, signor Presidente, che credo sia un giurista più raffinato di me, ma anche a me stesso che, ai sensi dell'articolo 12 delle preleggi, la prima interpretazione della norma è quella letterale.

Quando la Presidenza di quest'Aula è affidata ad un raffinato giurista come lei, credo che possa essere fatta un'eventuale riflessione su una prassi sbagliata, se c'è stata: lei ha l'autorevolezza e gli strumenti scientifici per modificarla e porre l'andamento dei lavori nella giusta direzione, nella più corretta interpretazione delle norme giuridiche, della Costituzione e del nostro Regolamento.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5695379972457886, 0.43046197295188904]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori, in data 21 gennaio 2014 il giudice per le indagini preliminari presso il tribunale di Trani ha trasmesso al Senato una domanda di autorizzazione all'utilizzazione di intercettazioni di conversazioni telefoniche del senatore Antonio Azzollini nell'ambito di un procedimento penale pendente anche nei suoi confronti. <p> Il Presidente del Senato ha deferito alla Giunta tale richiesta il 29 gennaio 2014 e l'ha annunciata in Aula in pari data. <p> La Giunta ha esaminato la domanda in varie sedute e nella seduta del 25 marzo il senatore Azzollini ha dato in distribuzione ai presenti una memoria riassuntiva e depositato un'ulteriore memoria difensiva, alla quale sono stati allegati vari documenti, precisando che la stessa analizza in maniera più dettagliata i profili indicati sinteticamente nella memoria riassuntiva precedentemente depositata. <p> In data 10 aprile 2014 la Giunta ha accolto la proposta del relatore di richiedere, attraverso la Presidenza del Senato, un'integrazione istruttoria al tribunale di Trani, volta all'acquisizione di copia della notizia di reato del Corpo forestale dello Stato, nonché del cronologico dettagliato di tutte le iscrizioni nel registro degli indagati a carico del senatore Azzollini, allo scopo di conoscere le date precise delle iscrizioni nel predetto registro per le singole e diverse ipotesi di reato. <p> L'integrazione documentale è stata trasmessa dall'autorità giudiziaria alla Presidenza del Senato in data 27 maggio 2014 e deferita alla Giunta il giorno successivo. <p> Nella seduta del 10 luglio 2014 la Giunta ha accolto le proposte dei componenti di trasmettere al Presidente del Senato la richiesta volta all'acquisizione, dall'autorità giudiziaria competente, dell'ordinanza di proroga del termine di durata delle indagini preliminari del 27 gennaio 2012 (e di tutti gli atti richiamati nell'ambito della stessa), come pure di tutte le ordinanze riguardanti ulteriori richieste di proroga delle indagini stesse (con i relativi atti richiamati). <p> L'ulteriore integrazione documentale è stata trasmessa dall'autorità giudiziaria al Presidente del Senato il 29 agosto 2014 e deferita alla Giunta il 3 settembre successivo. <p> La richiesta di autorizzazione in esame, trasmessa dal giudice per le indagini preliminari del tribunale di Trani, concerne l'intercettazione di dieci conversazioni telefoniche registrate tra il 4 maggio 2010 e il 6 ottobre 2011. <p> Si precisa preliminarmente che il giudice per le indagini preliminari ha invece ritenuto inutilizzabili i tabulati telefonici di utenza sottoposta a intercettazione effettuati il 4 maggio 2010, per i quali il pubblico ministero richiedeva l'autorizzazione all'utilizzo. <p> La richiesta si colloca nell'ambito di due procedimenti penali pendenti nei confronti del senatore Azzollini, in concorso con altri imputati, che riguardano i lavori di realizzazione nel nuovo porto commerciale di Molfetta, vicenda svoltasi tra il settembre 2006, quando il progetto definitivo dell'opera pubblica fu validato, e l'ottobre del 2012, quando il senatore si dimise da sindaco del comune di Molfetta. <p> Il senatore Azzollini, quindi, agendo in qualità di sindaco del comune di Molfetta, è accusato dall'autorità giudiziaria di aver commesso, in concorso con altri, una serie di reati che sono elencati nella relazione che è a vostra disposizione. <p> Il giudice per le indagini preliminari ha accolto l'istanza del pubblico ministero per l'inoltro al Senato della Repubblica della richiesta di autorizzazione all'utilizzo di intercettazioni nei confronti del senatore Azzollini, rigettando invece, come precedentemente sottolineato, l'istanza avanzata dalla procura di utilizzazione dei tabulati telefonici. <p> La difesa del senatore Azzollini ha eccepito la violazione dell'articolo 4 della legge n. 140 del 2003, come pure alcune nullità di tipo procedurale. Il giudice per le indagini preliminari, dopo aver rigettato le eccezioni procedurali, fa riferimento alla sentenza della Corte costituzionale n. 390 del 2007, per evidenziare come nel caso di specie non trovi applicazione l'articolo 4 della legge n. 140 del 2003 quanto l'articolo 6 della stessa legge. <p> Il giudice per le indagini preliminari precisa inoltre che la richiesta di autorizzazione all'utilizzo di intercettazioni telefoniche ha oggetto un'utenza in uso a Vincenzo Balducci ed è stata concessa non per il reato di abuso d'ufficio, quanto per quello di associazione a delinquere, turbativa d'asta, frode nelle pubbliche forniture e corruzione. Le telefonate sull'utenza del signor Balducci sono state effettuate dal 4 al 6 maggio 2010 e va evidenziato che il senatore Azzollini, iscritto nel registro degli indagati per il reato di abuso d'ufficio in data 16 marzo 2009, veniva iscritto il 30 aprile 2012 anche per i reati di truffa e truffa aggravata, mentre il 5 agosto 2013 veniva iscritto per il reato di associazione a delinquere. <p> Passando all'analisi delle ragioni sottese alla decisione della Giunta, si fa presente che la seconda integrazione istruttoria, deferita alla Giunta stessa il 3 settembre 2014, ha lasciato emergere, nell'ambito delle richieste di proroga delle indagini preliminari, l'indicazione del titolo di reato di associazione a delinquere per tutti i coindagati e quindi anche per il senatore Azzollini. La stessa procura nella lettera del 21 agosto 2014 dichiara testualmente: «Le rappresento come non debba trarre in inganno - con riguardo alla posizione giuridica dell'Azzollini Antonio - la circostanza dell'indicazione cumulativa e indifferenziata (omissis) dei titoli di reato». In realtà, la predetta indicazione indifferenziata dei titoli di reato (e quindi anche di quello di cui all'articolo 416 del codice penale) non solo può trarre effettivamente in inganno, ma è altresì suscettibile di creare un ragionevole dubbio in ordine alla data dell'effettivo inizio delle indagini nei confronti del senatore Azzollini per tale fattispecie criminosa. E in tal caso il principio, costituzionalmente rilevante, del favor rei comporta la logica conseguenza che il dubbio su un elemento così significativo per la valutazione dell'occasionalità o meno delle intercettazioni su utenze di terzi determini inevitabilmente il rigetto della richiesta di autorizzazione. Ma anche a seguire la tesi prospettata implicitamente dall'autorità giudiziaria - ossia quella dell'errore materiale - i profili di dubbio non sono risolti. Infatti, nel caso di specie l'iscrizione del senatore Azzollini per il reato di concorso in abuso d'ufficio, risalente al 19 marzo 2009, rendeva prevedibile un'interlocuzione abituale tra i vari concorrenti e, conseguentemente, rendeva concretamente configurabile per l'autorità inquirente il rischio che intercettando le conversazioni sulle utenze telefoniche intestate a terzi si potesse intercettare indirettamente anche il parlamentare in questione. Quindi, nel caso di specie l'autorità giudiziaria, pur non perseguendo in via diretta l'obiettivo di intercettare le conversazioni telefoniche del senatore Azzollini attraverso le utenze di terzi, non poteva non rappresentarsi la probabilità (o quantomeno la concreta possibilità) che intercettando terzi concorrenti nel reato, si intercettasse anche il parlamentare coinvolto in tale concorso. In tale contesto complessivo, la circostanza della natura del reato iscritto nel registro degli indagati potrebbe risultare irrilevante. Infatti, anche se in via meramente ipotetica considerassimo che la data del 16 marzo 2009 il senatore Azzollini fosse stato iscritto solo per concorso nel reato di abuso d'ufficio, sarebbe stato tuttavia prevedibile che lo stesso, anche nella sua qualità di sindaco del Comune committente dei lavori pubblici in questione, potesse intrattenere rapporti e colloqui abituali e ripetuti con il soggetto incaricato di realizzare l'opera stessa (e peraltro concorrente nel reato di abuso d'ufficio). Tale circostanza risulta assorbente rispetto ad altre questioni emerse nel corso dell'istruttoria e in particolare a quella attinente alla data effettiva di iscrizione del senatore Azzollini per il reato di associazione a delinquere. Per le sopra esposte argomentazioni la Giunta ha deliberato di proporre all'Assemblea il diniego dell'autorizzazione all'utilizzo delle intercettazioni telefoniche nei confronti del senatore Antonio Azzollini.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5062702298164368, 0.49372974038124084]}, {'sequence': 'Signor Presidente, onorevoli rappresentanti del Governo, colleghi, i chiarimenti forniti ieri sera dal ministro Padoan alle Commissioni riunite, rivelano che siamo di fronte ad una manovra in linea con quelle precedenti, ma che genera ancora più deficit. Eppure eravamo rimasti alle parole del premier Renzi di lunedì scorso, secondo cui l\\'azione del suo Governo non si baserebbe sui bonus, ma su misure strutturali. Per misura strutturale si intende quella che non è occasionale o congiunturale e che possiede una solida copertura finanziaria. Le principali azioni intraprese in questi tre anni non hanno la prima caratteristica. Eppure, laddove abbiano la prima proprietà, si basano largamente su coperture assicurate da clausole di salvaguardia su IVA e accise. La legge di bilancio per il prossimo anno sarà al 60 per cento costituita da misure volte a coprire la clausola rimasta attiva per il 2017, che vale 15 miliardi, coperta con 13,3 miliardi di deficit. Quindi è il Governo dei bonus, ma anche delle clausole. Accanto alle clausole di salvaguardia, che rimarranno comunque in eredità alle manovre successive (lo ricordiamo per memoria: 20 miliardi e mezzo per ciascuno degli anni 2018 e 2019) ci sono le clausole di flessibilità. Questo costituisce l\\'altro grande imbroglio della politica economica del Governo. Infatti la gente è convinta che l\\'Europa, autorizzando la clausola di flessibilità sui migranti, mandi soldi all\\'Italia per coprire le spese legate alla loro permanenza nel Paese, in attesa del vaglio delle domande per un eventuale asilo. In realtà, significa che la Commissione europea autorizza il nostro Paese ad una ulteriore spesa in deficit per 3,3 miliardi, per la quale l\\'Italia dovrà emettere ulteriori titoli di debito pubblico. Detto per inciso, per affrontare la crisi dei migranti l\\'Italia ha ricevuto dalla UE solo 112 milioni nel 2016, quindi l\\'accoglienza dei migranti oggi la paghiamo noi, ma la pagheranno i nostri figli e sicuramente anche i nostri nipoti, considerato che ormai l\\'Italia emette buoni del Tesoro di durata cinquantennale. La valutazione che diamo di questo sesto documento previsionale del Governo Renzi può essere fatta sul raffronto con le previsioni mancate dal 2014 ad oggi. L\\'azzeramento del livello dell\\'indebitamento netto, che secondo le previsioni del 2014 avrebbe dovuto raggiungersi a ridosso del 2017, ora si sposta a data da destinarsi, cioè ben oltre l\\'orizzonte programmatico del 2019. Oltretutto, va sottolineato che la spesa per la ricostruzione post-terremoto (per la quale si è chiesta una ulteriore clausola di flessibilità dello 0,2) è da considerare una spesa davvero eccezionale, perché rappresenta il giusto risarcimento per i superstiti del sisma del centro Italia e un investimento nel patrimonio abitativo e pubblico delle zone colpite che muoverà sicuramente l\\'economia di quelle zone. Al contrario, per i migranti, si tratta di risorse pubbliche utilizzate male per un evento largamente previsto e quindi evitabile. La spesa per la gestione dei migranti si è quasi triplicata in questi ultimi anni. L\\'importo previsto per il 2017 sarà pari a quello dello scorso anno, cioè di 3 miliardi e 300 milioni. Quindi nulla di imprevisto, ma piuttosto il risultato di una pessima politica estera che non ha fatto valere l\\'Italia sui tavoli europei. Con la nuova spesa in deficit si sposta, di conseguenza, anche il traguardo verso la riduzione del rapporto debito - <PARTY>L, che rimane nel 2017 stabilmente sopra il 132 per cento, anche nel nuovo quadro programmatico. Lontanissimo, ovviamente, il livello del 120 per cento considerato \"sostenibile\" per i conti pubblici italiani, che pure era stato assicurato come obiettivo raggiungibile per il 2018 nel DEF di due anni fa. Intanto, il Governo continua, e va sottolineato, a beneficiare del regalo di Mario Draghi e della BCE, che continuerà ad acquistare i nostri titoli almeno fino a tutto il prossimo anno. Vorrei aggiungere un\\'altra considerazione: penso che un documento economico e programmatico dovrebbe contenere valutazioni serie sulla sostenibilità del debito. Infatti parte della manovra per il prossimo anno verrà sostenuta grazie ai minori interessi passivi preventivati per quasi 5 miliardi. Le stime del prodotto interno lordo scendono rispetto al quadro programmatico d\\'inizio mandato, nonostante un crescente livello della spesa pubblica posta dal Governo a presidio della crescita del <PARTY>L. 28,5 miliardi di crescita del <PARTY>L nominale nel 2017 sembrano ora poco realistici, perché si è in presenza di un livello di inflazione prossimo allo zero. Ma il problema non è quanto siano accurate le previsioni sull\\'incremento del prodotto interno lordo, che cresce nonostante l\\'azione largamente depressiva del Governo. La domanda a cui bisogna rispondere è per quale ragione gli investitori scappino dall\\'Italia. Infatti, sia il risparmio italiano che il denaro degli investitori mondiali, purtroppo, non sono attratti dalle attività produttive del nostro Paese. La nuova manovra quindi, si baserà su misure una tantum, sui tanti, troppi, bonus e sui pochi tagli agli sprechi. Continuiamo a leggere una pericolosissima sottovalutazione delle dinamiche della spesa corrente. Quello che manca nella Nota sono proprio le proposte; prima fra tutte, come fare uscire da sotto il mattone il risparmio dei nostri concittadini, e quindi come ricreare fiducia nel sistema Paese. Al calo del reddito delle famiglie italiane si deve rispondere con politiche che garantiscano una tenuta duratura del potere di acquisto. Per questo servono fatti concreti. Infatti, nonostante il racconto renziano, le cronache italiane parlano ancora di furbetti del cartellino, di scuole senza professori a un mese dall\\'inizio dell\\'anno scolastico, di soffitti che crollano nelle classi, di finti profughi che costano agli italiani 35 euro al giorno, di degrado urbano, di casi di corruzione, di morti in corsie d\\'ospedale: cioè di una Italia che non ha assolutamente cambiato verso. Allora diventa anche inutile spostare il dibattito sul merito dei 47 articoli modificati della Carta fondamentale. Il no al referendum deve essere un chiaro voto contro la politica economica disastrosa di questi anni del Governo Renzi, che ha indebitato il Paese a un livello record e che continuerebbe qualora il Paese, a dicembre desse, la fiducia a questo Esecutivo.

Siamo, quindi, in notevole ritardo e arriviamo con un testo che - ahimè - è fin troppo superato. Insieme ad alcuni Paesi dell'Europa dell'Est siamo rimasti tra gli ultimi nel panorama europeo a non aver ancora regolamentato la materia. <p> Sono stata attenta e ho ascoltato tanti interventi a favore e contro il cosiddetto disegno di legge Cirinnà. Mi dispiace aver ascoltato qualche minuto fa l'intervento del senatore Marinello, che come argomento a discredito della relatrice ha voluto utilizzare il suo impegno a tutela dei diritti dei cuccioli dei cani e dei gatti. Egli mi ha, però, fornito un assist su un piatto d'argento. A questo proposito ricordo quali sono state le argomentazioni utilizzate da chi sostiene il no e si è opposto all'equiparazione dell'unione civile al matrimonio, per far capire quale sia il livello della discussione svolta da questo punto di vista. Qualche nostro eminente collega ha detto che, mentre il matrimonio è nullo se non è consumato, non si riesce a capire bene chi vada a stabilire che tipo di rapporto c'è tra coloro che stipulano le unioni civili. Qualcun altro ha avuto il coraggio di affermare che la presenza non solo della madre, ma anche del padre permette che la nostra specie abbia una possibilità di sviluppo maggiore e con un cervello più grande di quello degli altri animali della nostra statura. Questi sono stati gli argomenti utilizzati a favore della tesi che non si può equiparare l'unione civile al matrimonio. Poi ho sentito quelli che io definisco, in questa e in altre sedi, i benaltristi, cioè tutti quelli che ci ricordano che in questo Paese c'è ben altro da fare: ci sono le questioni del lavoro, dell'emigrazione, dell'economia. Sono tutti temi dei quali questo Governo si sta occupando pienamente. Vi ricordo che abbiamo ereditato un Paese con un tasso di disoccupazione altissimo, con un <PARTY>L a -2,3 per cento e ora possiamo guardare a numeri positivi, cioè al +0,8 per cento. Ci stiamo, quindi, occupando a 360 gradi della ripresa e del rilancio del nostro Paese, mentre quelle stesse persone che io chiamo benaltristi, che hanno avuto la responsabilità di Governo negli ultimi venti anni, si sono effettivamente occupati a fare ben altro e ci hanno lasciato tutto questo in eredità. Non credo, inoltre, che i diritti civili siano qualcosa di cui occuparsi in secondo luogo, perché ritengo siano assolutamente centrali nella vita dei cittadini. Dicevo che è una giornata storica. Bene hanno fatto il senatore Zanda e il presidente Renzi a dire che indietro non si torna. Io ringrazio la senatrice Cirinnà e i colleghi che, in Commissione giustizia, hanno dato l'anima per portare questo testo così come è in Aula. Si tratta - secondo me - non di un testo che è un compromesso al ribasso, ma di una delle mediazioni più alte che si potesse fare, perché ci consente perlomeno il riconoscimento e l'estensione di diritti sociali. Per quanto riguarda la tematica della stepchild adoption, non credo assolutamente che il tema vada stralciato, ma che sia la proposta più corretta possibile per garantire il diritto dei bambini a vivere in un contesto familiare amorevole, ad essere amati da genitori, di qualunque sesso essi siano. In nessun caso nel testo si parla di riconoscimento del diritto dei genitori ad avere figli, ma del diritto dei bambini a essere amati e ad avere riconosciuto il loro diritto a essere amati nelle loro famiglie. PRESIDENTE. Senatrice, la invito a concludere. SPILABOTTE (<PARTY>). È stato anche utilizzato come argomento di errata comunicazione il fatto che la stepchild adoption apra all'utilizzo della pratica dell'utero in affitto. Non è scritto da nessuna parte. C'è la legge n. 40 del 2004, che è pessima, che è stata smontata dalle sentenze dei giudici e a cui mi auguro questo Parlamento rimetta mano, per dare una legge decente al nostro Paese. Il testo in discussione non ne parla e non ho sentito nessuno di quelli che hanno svolto accorati interventi contro questo tema affermare, invece, che si tratta di una pratica adottata dall'84 per cento delle coppie eterosessuali, che ritengono più moralmente accettabile comprarsi un bambino all'estero, piuttosto che adottarne uno, visto che hanno la possibilità di farlo nel nostro Paese.

Si tratta dell'espulsione della senatrice Adele Gambaro, rea di aver rilasciato un'intervista ad una televisione privata. <p> La mia valutazione è che si tratti di un fatto pubblico che ha una chiarissima evidenza istituzionale. Non è un fatto privato; non appartiene alla vita interna di un partito, ancorché, se vi appartenesse, sarebbe comunque emendabile, anzi condannabile. <p> La mia opinione, signor Presidente, è che venga lesa una libertà costituzionale fondamentale, la libertà di pensiero, e che nell'espulsione da un Gruppo parlamentare e non da un partito si segni una svolta significativa. <p> I Gruppi parlamentari da una parte della giurisprudenza italiana sono considerati alla stregua dei partiti. Conosco bene la polemica che nel tempo si è innescata e conosco, per averla studiata nel corso della notte e questa mattina, la polemica che nel tempo si è costruita: Gruppi ritenuti da parte di una certa giurisprudenza simili a partiti. <p> Io appartengo invece al ramo di chi ritiene che i Gruppi parlamentari non abbiano la natura dei partiti. I Gruppi parlamentari sono espressione di una struttura parlamentare. Sono infatti Gruppi parlamentari. Nella loro costituzione rispondono a regole. Se quelle regole non vengono rispettate, lei correttamente, signor Presidente, applicando la normativa, non consente la costituzione di un Gruppo, come la sua stessa collega Presidente della Camera non lo consente alla Camera dei deputati. <p> Qui siamo addirittura di fronte ad un caso ancora più particolare, perché siamo in presenza di una sorta di censura, cioè una sorta di negazione preventiva rispetto all'espressione di una opinione, quindi al fatto di non corrispondere ad un principio costituzionale che i costituenti hanno protetto nell'articolo 21 della Carta: libertà di pensiero. <p> Rivolgo tre domande a lei, signor Presidente, e ai nostri colleghi. Voglio sapere se siamo in presenza di un regolamento antidemocratico e antiliberale del <PARTY>. Le chiedo se si è in presenza di un regolamento che abbia caratteristiche di tal genere e se esso possa essere compatibile con la natura democratica e liberale del Senato nel quale ciascuno di noi siede.

L'articolo 35 garantisce la libertà di parola, però quella Costituzione obbliga a leggere tale articolo in connessione con i principi generali. Si tratta esattamente di quanto avviene tra statuto e rinvio ai principi che guidano il Movimento Cinque Stelle. Quando questi principi sono in contrasto, in opposizione al documento principale, non è possibile, e quindi è vietata, la libertà di parola, di espressione. Non può per norma quella libertà essere esercitata. <p> Reputo che i Gruppi siano diversi dai partiti e che all'interno di quest'Aula essi debbano avere regolamenti ispirati alla democrazia parlamentare alla quale siamo stati educati.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5427165031433105, 0.45728346705436707]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, membri del Governo, colleghe e colleghi, signor Ministro degli affari esteri e della cooperazione internazionale, a fronte di una crisi geopolitica così delicata, complessa ed importante, che investe anche il nostro Paese, ci aspettavamo che questa informativa in Assemblea fosse di assoluta priorità. Peccato per questa inspiegabile lungaggine e per questo ritardo! Si potrebbe dire: meglio tardi che mai, ma non intendo polemizzare, poiché non mi appassiona e comunque non è il momento, né il luogo. <p> Ottimo lavoro comunque per quel che riguarda le cinque proposte. Non si può che partire da un punto fondamentale: il degenerare della situazione in Afghanistan dimostra che la democrazia non è esportabile, laddove non supportata da dovuti presupposti e laddove non vi siano altri interessi predominanti. Pensare di cambiare o imporre la cultura altrui è inaccettabile, soprattutto quando non sono chiari gli obiettivi di una simile politica, poiché ogni popolo ha un suo processo storico e culturale. Non dobbiamo farci tentare dal desiderio di esportare la democrazia, ma sarebbe meglio concentrarsi sulla tutela dei diritti umani a livello globale, i quali non hanno confini nazionali. Ciò deve avvenire solamente attraverso azioni mirate e con la diplomazia, insieme a una lotta decisa contro il terrorismo internazionale. <p> Questo è il momento ideale per dimostrarlo. <p> La politica estera non si basa esclusivamente sull'ideologia politica dei singoli partiti, ma sulla diplomazia multilaterale o sui soli interessi di ogni singola azione poiché la politica stessa non si fonda su sensazioni o prime impressioni, ma sul realismo e, cioè, la capacità di leggere e interpretare le situazioni reali per come esse si presentano per arrivare a una soluzione di qualità. È questa capacità di coesione organizzativa che oggi manca all'Unione europea in un mondo che ormai già mostra gli effetti della globalizzazione anche dal punto di vista geopolitico. <p> Non possiamo rischiare che l'Europa resti ai margini della politica estera o, peggio ancora, che subisca le decisioni di altre potenze mondiali. Ora ci troviamo ad affrontare le conseguenze della crisi. Dovremo tutelare i veri profughi, come contemplato anche dalle linee guida della nostra politica sull'immigrazione, attraverso uno sforzo comune e condiviso da tutti i Paesi dell'Unione europea, senza dimenticare che dobbiamo trovare un'identità e una visione comunitaria in politica estera e non solo per combattere terrorismo e garantire la libertà e i diritti conquistati. <p> È evidente che l'Italia da sola non possa accogliere centinaia di migliaia di profughi sia per limiti strutturali, sia per la necessaria cautela per evitare i rischi imminenti di infiltrazioni terroristiche. <p> Signori Ministri, allo stesso tempo è fondamentale implementare un'azione di contrasto alla barbarie del traffico di esseri umani. <p> Questo è il momento di agire e non più di parole inutili. Il rapido disimpegno dell'Occidente in Afghanistan e la contestuale ascesa dei talebani non può renderci ciechi e indifferenti innanzi alle scene cui abbiamo assistito. È, infatti, intollerabile limitarsi ad assistere a manifeste violazioni dei diritti umani e della rule of law, unitamente a tragiche scene di un'imminente crisi umanitaria in corso. Tutto ciò non può che essere fonte di imprevedibili rischi globali legati a una situazione di assoluta instabilità e incertezza, in aggiunta a quelle libica, siriana e libanese. Il Parlamento deve essere il luogo di dialogo e discussione competente in quanto casa della democrazia. Ciò deve avvenire sia nelle scelte strategiche e tutele dei veri profughi, sia nella tutela del diritto del popolo italiano a vivere al sicuro dal rischio di immigrazione incontrollata e soprattutto di potenziali terroristi. Mai come oggi in questa sede serve una visione lucida dell'effettiva evoluzione dello scenario della crisi umanitaria e geopolitica affinché si possa arrivare a una condivisione di responsabilità tra tutti i Paesi coinvolti abbracciando due specifiche linee direttrici: la tutela dei diritti umani e la tutela della sicurezza internazionale.

L'ho fatto senza interessi di bottega, mentre ero in minoranza mesi fa, quando è iniziato tutto il percorso, ho continuato sino ad oggi a lavorare con la stessa tenacia e testardaggine. A differenza di quei 180 miliardi di euro buttati all'italiana, vorrei che queste altre risorse fossero spese con criterio e in modo corretto; lo dobbiamo a tutti quelli che hanno sofferto e che stanno soffrendo per questa pandemia, che mi sembra non finire più. La politica, si sa, è l'arte di mediare e cambiare le cose, e lo fa sempre a modo suo; talvolta anche io faccio fatica a capire come ci riesca. Tuttavia, per la politica è sempre difficile cambiare le persone come me: è una sorta di odio-amore. Sono stato il primo a denunciare in Commissione lo scarso, se non nullo, coinvolgimento del Parlamento. Sono stato il primo ad alzare i toni sulla scarsa capacità del Parlamento di entrare nel merito del Piano. E ricordo ancora quei sorrisetti infastiditi degli ex Ministri alle mie parole e parlo non della preistoria, ma solo di qualche mese fa. Sono stato il primo a dire che il Piano doveva essere centrato non sul Mezzogiorno, ma sull'Italia intera, perché la pandemia ha colpito a morte iniziando la sua discesa proprio dalla mia terra e poi successivamente ha affamato tutto il Paese. Non dimentichiamolo mai questo. Non è più il momento delle divisioni: è il momento di far ripartire insieme il nostro Paese. Lei non sa e nemmeno immagina quanto mi sarebbe piaciuto essere qui oggi con un quadro di impegni e di investimenti chiaro, da votare con orgoglio, da far vedere alla Nazione. Quanto mi sarebbe piaciuto avere tra le mani un piano di investimenti che dicesse nero su bianco agli italiani, all'Italia intera, dalla Valle d'Aosta alla Sicilia, quali sono i progetti, dove si sviluppano, quali per il Centro, quali per il Nord, quali per il Sud; quali saranno le ricadute economiche; quali saranno le analisi costi-benefici; come affronteremo le condizionalità. Oggi non abbiamo da presentare e da condividere tutto questo. Abbiamo audito quasi 300 persone, associazioni, Ministri, professori, comitati. Non ci siamo risparmiati su niente e di questo ringrazio il presidente Stefano, tutta la Commissione e le forze politiche che hanno partecipato, in un momento difficilissimo per tutti, fatto di zone rosse, di riunioni in presenza e a distanza. Io vorrei dare il mio contributo a questo Piano. È un mio dovere politico, civico e morale. Non voglio e non posso tirarmi indietro, perché non credo sia giusto. La politica deve responsabilizzarsi e alle volte fare scelte difficili. Oggi per me è una di quelle giornate fatte di scelte difficili: mi dovrò esprimere e dovrò indirizzare le mie decisioni sulla fiducia a un Piano di investimenti che, per un massimo di quasi 200 miliardi, verrà redatto da uffici tecnici; in sostanza, sarà quasi totalmente rifatto dai Ministeri; non sarà elaborato - come si vuol far credere - da questo Parlamento, che non lo ha nemmeno visto e non lo vedrà fino all'ultimo giorno utile prima di andare a Bruxelles per essere presentato, ma che responsabilmente se ne sta prendendo di fatto la paternità. Mi farebbe male, signor Presidente, scoprire un giorno che i nostri figli siano messi in condizione di pagare la scelta strategica che ha fatto un tecnico, perché quel benedetto tempo di lavorare in modo diverso purtroppo non c'era e non c'è mai. Capisco, dall'altra parte, le difficoltà del nuovo Governo ad affrontare in trenta giorni un lavoro che, come minimo, doveva durare otto o nove mesi. Capisco e vedo un lavoro, il precedente recovery plan, totalmente sbagliato, partito sul nascere in modo sbagliato, sottovalutato e lasciato inevitabilmente in mano a burocrati che stanno cercando di riscriverlo. Io sono moralmente costretto a votare la proposta di risoluzione di maggioranza proprio per il discorso di responsabilità che ho fatto prima, ma non posso permettere che il Paese perda anche un solo centesimo di quel Piano di investimenti. Spero solo che quegli uffici abbiano lavorato e lavorino in questi ultimi trenta giorni con la stessa tenacia e volontà che ci ho messo io e ci ha messo la Commissione. Abbiamo consegnato 73 pagine di relazione congiunta, più allegati e dettagliate relazioni delle Commissioni. Si tratta di una mole di lavoro gigantesca; auspico che il Governo ne faccia buon uso e tenga conto delle segnalazioni che abbiamo fatto pervenire.

Signora Presidente, ringrazio il sottosegretario D'Onghia. Siamo soddisfatti di quello che lei ha detto, in particolare rispetto ad un punto, ossia che le sperimentazioni quadriennali degli istituti di istruzione secondaria superiore prevedono una rimodulazione complessiva del carico orario nei due bienni, e non un mero taglio, per così dire, dell'ultimo anno. Voglio pensare che questo significhi che, anche fra l'attuale biennio e l'attuale triennio, ci sia una rimodulazione, perché se quest'ultima dovesse avvenire, com'è appunto il rischio da più parti indicato, con una riformulazione dei carichi orari interni all'attuale biennio e all'attuale triennio, ebbene il problema si porrebbe nuovamente. Il punto è che, ferma restando naturalmente l'autonomia degli istituti e delle università italiane, questa sperimentazione sta avvenendo - come indicato nell'interrogazione - contemporaneamente alla soppressione dell'insegnamento della filosofia teoretica, in particolare in alcuni corsi universitari delle facoltà di scienze dell'educazione e di pedagogia. Questo pone il rischio che, all'interno del nostro sistema d'istruzione secondaria e universitaria, si compia un'azione di rafforzamento, anche positiva, della cultura scientifica. È vero che, nonostante le eccellenze che il nostro Paese ha prodotto nel campo della cultura scientifica, forse c'è un ritardo, una sottovalutazione della centralità, dell'importanza della cultura scientifica e tecnologica, anche rispetto al contesto internazionale in cui ci muoviamo, ma è altrettanto vero che il consolidamento della cultura scientifica, se non vogliamo si limiti a diventare una mera esecuzione procedurale di tecniche, necessita di quello sguardo lungo che solamente un pensiero - un pensiero filosofico, un pensiero teorico - può dare per far sì che la scienza non si risolva in mere procedure e applicazioni di tecniche ma sappia essere invece indicazione di scelte, individuazione di prospettive, capacità di relazione, di comprensione e quindi di progettazione. Da questo punto di vista, sono soddisfatto della ricchezza della risposta. Rimane la preoccupazione che, nella rimodulazione dei programmi e dei carichi orari delle scuole secondarie superiori, in particolare di quelle poche scuole in cui oggi è presente l'insegnamento della filosofia, da una parte, e nella rideterminazione dell'articolazione dei piani di lavoro delle facoltà di scienza dell'educazione e di pedagogia, dall'altra, la filosofia venga sacrificata. Da questo punto di vista, prendo atto in maniera positiva dell'impegno che il Sottosegretario ha assunto qui, a nome del Governo, sulla volontà di fare in modo che non venga ridotta la portata di questo insegnamento all'interno del nostro sistema di istruzione e formazione, perché sarebbe veramente un venir meno rispetto a quella eccellenza del nostro pensiero, della nostra cultura, che proprio grazie alla sua creatività riesce oggi ad essere competitiva a livello internazionale anche dal punto scientifico, tecnologico e produttivo; e vi riesce proprio perché ha dietro quel pensiero lungo che una tradizione filosofica, culturale e teorica forte ha sostenuto nella storia del nostro Paese.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.538672924041748, 0.46132707595825195]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, rappresentanti del Governo, onorevoli senatrici, onorevoli senatori, non entrerò in questa polemica sterile con la minoranza, perché non ne vale la pena e l'Italia non ha più tempo per voi. È ora di smetterla. <p> Trattiamo oggi la conversione in legge del decreto-legge n. 44 del 2018, in merito alle misure urgenti in materia di ammortizzatori sociali in deroga, ovvero andiamo a dibattere sulla necessità di finanziare, per ulteriori 9 milioni di euro, un provvedimento di cassa integrazione guadagni in deroga, in modo da coprire tutto il 2018 per 1.000 lavoratori della Sardegna. <p> Si tratta di un provvedimento che ci arriva dal passato e sul quale ci è stato in pratica impedito di intervenire in quanto in scadenza - come è stato ricordato - per il giorno 8 luglio. Di fatto, quindi, qualunque emendamento approvato avrebbe implicato un nuovo passaggio alla Camera e dunque impedito di rientrare nei termini temporali consentiti. <p> Il provvedimento è molto semplice e limitato, è un provvedimento puntuale; un compitino proveniente dal passato Governo, al pari di numerosi provvedimenti che ci siamo abituati a vedere nella scorsa legislatura. Si mette una pezza sperando che regga. <p> Se da una parte si tratta, infatti, di un provvedimento dovuto per circa 1.000 lavoratori (con le loro famiglie), appartenenti a due aree, quella di Porto Torres e Portovesme (Nord-Ovest e Sud-Ovest della Sardegna), riconosciute come aree di crisi industriale complessa, dall'altra non possiamo esimerci da fare alcune riflessioni sul fatto che negli ultimi anni diverse zone in terra sarda sono state abbandonate a se stesse e oggi ritroviamo intere aree in uno stato di profonda crisi occupazionale ed economica. <p> Poco o nulla è stato fatto in questi anni per rilanciare l'occupazione dei lavoratori sardi, anzi. Anni di politiche improntate sull'austerità si sono rivelate - come da noi predetto - fortemente recessive e, sicuramente, hanno contribuito a generare le migliori condizioni per una tempesta occupazionale perfetta, anzi una tragedia occupazionale perfetta, in tutta Italia, isole comprese ovviamente. <p> Con il provvedimento in esame andremo a dare ai 1.000 lavoratori (con le loro famiglie) una boccata d'ossigeno fino a fine anno, ma sappiamo benissimo che nei prossimi mesi avremo l'onere di andare ad aiutare in modo molto più strutturato l'occupazione in terra sarda. Circa 1.000 euro al mese netti a 1.000 lavoratori, circa 1.500 euro lordi per sei mesi, pari a 9 milioni di euro: bene, ma dopo? Senza dubbio la Sardegna è una Regione a spiccata vocazione turistica e senza dubbio il nuovo ministro del turismo, senatore Gian Marco Centinaio, con il quale ci congratuliamo per il nuovo incarico e al quale facciamo il nostro più sentito in bocca al lupo <p> , sarà in grado di valorizzare ancor di più questa inclinazione. Ma non possiamo pensare che tutta l'isola, abitata da più di un milione e mezzo di anime e terza in Italia per estensione dopo Sicilia e Piemonte, possa dipendere da un singolo settore, seppur trainante. <p> Ecco allora che dobbiamo ripensare le potenzialità dell'isola, cercando di andare a valorizzare la sua posizione strategica al centro del Mediterraneo oltre alle eccellenze manifatturiere, alle capacità nelle attività agricole e pastorizie e allo sviluppo di settori industriali di nicchia, che qui potrebbero trovare possibilità di crescita. <p> Tornando al provvedimento in esame, vorrei ringraziare sia la Commissione congiunta della Camera che la 11ᵃ Commissione del Senato per la rapidità con cui sono riuscite a licenziare il provvedimento che, nello specifico, è composto da tre articoli. <p> Nel primo articolo si confermano i poli industriali di Porto Torres e Portovesme quali aree di crisi industriale complessa e dunque necessitanti di un intervento urgente volto a prorogare la mobilità straordinaria per i suddetti 1.000 lavoratori circa. A tal fine si consente alla Regione Sardegna di destinare 9 milioni di euro, provenienti dal Fondo sociale per l'occupazione e la formazione, per il rifinanziamento degli ammortizzatori sociali in deroga in tali zone, andando a coprire tutto il 2018. <p> Nel successivo secondo articolo si chiarisce che il finanziamento delle proroghe di questi ammortizzatori sociali è consentito anche per le Regioni che abbiano adottato la proroga dopo il 31 dicembre 2016, purché essa riguardi trattamenti in scadenza entro tale data e comunque la cui durata di proroga non superi il 31 dicembre 2017. <p> Questo non comporta nuovi o maggiori oneri perché, come da disposizioni della legge n. 205 del 2017, vengono utilizzate risorse che erano già state destinate alle due aree in oggetto mediante il riparto stabilito dall'articolo 44 del decreto legislativo n. 148 del 2015 e che non sono ancora state del tutto esaurite. Tale ripartizione teneva infatti conto di tutte le sospensioni o riduzioni dell'orario di lavoro iniziate entro la fine del 2016, anche se la Regione non aveva ancora avviato l' iter per i dovuti ammortizzatori sociali che sarebbero potuti iniziare a seguito di uno specifico accordo sottoscritto dalle parti presso le unità di crisi del Ministero dello sviluppo economico o delle Regioni stesse entro tale data. In pratica la situazione che ha reso necessaria questa modifica è figlia di un ritardo regionale nell'emanazione del provvedimento di concessione dei trattamenti da prorogare. Se non ci fosse stato questo ritardo, la proroga poteva essere adottata in continuità, come già ricordato, in base a quanto previsto dall'articolo 1 della legge n. 205 del 27 dicembre 2017. In sintesi, qualcuno tra Regione Sardegna e MISE ha un pochino dormito, abbreviato: <PARTY>. Ad ogni modo l'articolo 2 supera le disparità che si creerebbero tra situazioni di fatto identiche, in quanto traenti tutte origine da eventi antecedenti al 31 dicembre 2016. Nell'ultimo articolo, infine, è disposta l'entrata in vigore della legge. Concludo, Presidente, con un'ultima osservazione sulla situazione del lavoro in Italia. La Lega è molto preoccupata per la situazione che ha trovato. I dati che ci vengono sciorinati su una fanta-occupazione in crescita rendono in realtà la fotografia di una Nazione in forte difficoltà occupazionale, i cui cittadini sono costretti ad accettare contratti di lavoro in stragrande maggioranza a tempo determinato e per periodi temporali limitatissimi. II posto fisso è ormai un miraggio e per di più le riforme volute da Renzi hanno reso di fatto precari anche i neoassunti a tempo indeterminato. Ma che futuro può pianificare una persona che il giorno prima non sa se il giorno dopo avrà ancora un lavoro? Che vita è? Noi della Lega crediamo che il lavoro debba diventare il tema centrale di questa legislatura e non risparmieremo energie per invertire la tendenza. Meno licenziamenti, meno assistenzialismo e maggior impegno per creare le condizioni necessarie al rilancio occupazionale, in Sardegna come in tutto il resto d'Italia. <p> È iscritta a parlare la senatrice Rizzotti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6070379614830017, 0.3929620385169983]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> <PARTY>LIPPIN, relatrice. Signor Presidente, devo confessare che assisto con un certo smarrimento alla discussione di questo pomeriggio. È come se la discussione svoltasi nella seduta antimeridiana di giovedì scorso non vi fosse stata. Paradossalmente, sento gli stessi argomenti con cui le relatrici hanno proposto lo stralcio essere usati adesso contro la ratifica semplice. Delle due l'una, allora: o abbiamo sbagliato nel proporre lo stralcio, oppure, evidentemente, se abbiamo proposto lo stralcio, un motivo c'era. Il motivo era la difficoltà di adeguare l'istituzione della kafala al nostro sistema e al nostro ordinamento. Ma che cosa suggerisce, che cosa contiene la Convenzione di cui stiamo parlando? Chiedo scusa all'Aula, ma vi leggerò il testo dell'articolo 1 della Convenzione stessa. «La presente Convenzione si prefigge di determinare lo Stato le cui autorità sono competenti ad adottare misure volte alla protezione del minore o dei beni del minore; di determinare la legge applicabile da tali autorità nell'esercizio della loro competenza; di determinare la legge applicabile alla responsabilità genitoriale; di assicurare il riconoscimento e l'esecuzione delle misure di protezione in tutti gli Stati contraenti; di stabilire tra le autorità degli Stati contraenti la cooperazione necessaria alla realizzazione degli obiettivi della Convenzione» ovvero stabilire quale autorità e quale legge si applicano ad un minore che non si trova più nello Stato di residenza abituale. Tutto qui. Il problema della kafala, vale a dire dell'istituto giuridico che deve essere applicato al minore che dovesse entrare nel territorio italiano, è sì denso di problemi, ma è per questo che rispetto alla Camera ne abbiamo proposto all'Aula lo stralcio proprio al fine di valutare quali istituti del diritto italiano è meglio applicare per assicurare il pieno rispetto di tutti i principi costituzionali che qui, in Italia, non si toccano per nessuno, uomo, donna o bambino.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.9194003939628601, 0.08059961348772049]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, in pochi minuti voglio anch'io esprimere il mio pensiero sul fatto che ci troviamo a deliberare qui nell'Aula del Senato a soli cinque giorni dalla scadenza del termine per la conversione. Però voglio farlo con parole e accenti un po' diversi da quelli che mi hanno preceduto, perché vorrei che ci liberassimo una volta tanto anche noi da certi toni di ipocrisia e di retorica che ci sono sempre in queste nostre discussioni. <p> È vero che ce ne lamentiamo tutti e che siamo rammaricati del fatto di non avere, come membri del Senato, il tempo per intervenire su questo decreto. Però, intanto, diciamo la verità: questo è successo molte volte a parte inverse quando siamo stati noi a mandare all'ultimo momento dei provvedimenti alla Camera e abbiamo ascoltato le lamentazioni di segno opposto venute da quell'Aula del Parlamento. Poi sappiamo anche che il lungo tempo, necessario alla Camera per discutere questo provvedimento, è stato il risultato di una discussione politica e di merito molto accesa e complessa che è avvenuta nella maggioranza e nella Commissione. Penso che di questi temi bisogna farsi carico tutti. Quella discussione è parte anche nostra; non possiamo immaginarla come qualcosa che sta fuori di noi. Vorrei dirlo con molta pacatezza perché altrimenti perdiamo gran parte della nostra discussione in una lamentazione che non ha molto senso. <p> Detto questo, vorrei sottolineare, come abbiamo già detto anche in occasione dell'esame del cosiddetto decreto valore cultura, arrivato in quest'Aula poche settimane fa e che abbiamo affrontato anche noi per lungo tempo a parti inverse, che questo decreto si caratterizza essenzialmente per un segnale d'inversione di tendenza: dopo tanto tempo abbiamo provvedimenti che tornano a investire risorse, magari non tutte quelle che ci saremmo potuti aspettare, ma comunque risorse significative intorno ad alcuni temi cruciali (edilizia scolastica, personale, formazione e dispersione scolastica). Penso che di questo dobbiamo fare tesoro, prenderne atto e impegnarci a tradurlo rapidamente in provvedimenti che hanno un'influenza non solo sulla scuola, ma anche sulla ripresa di quel meccanismo dinamico del nostro Paese che è indispensabile. <p> Tra pochi giorni discuteremo in quest'Aula della legge di stabilità, e sappiamo che il nodo fondamentale di quella legge è poter garantire l'obiettivo dell'1 per cento di sviluppo, altrimenti molte delle nostre discussioni non staranno in piedi. Bene, questi provvedimenti possono dare un contributo, ancorché piccolo, a questa prospettiva. Dobbiamo saper cogliere il nesso che c'è fra questi investimenti e lo sviluppo complessivo del nostro Paese. <p> Altri colleghi del Gruppo del <PARTY> interverranno su questi nodi complessi e non voglio dire di più, ma sottolineare l'ispirazione positiva del provvedimento che ci apprestiamo ad approvare con convinzione. <p> In conclusione del mio breve intervento voglio semplicemente sottolineare il valore importante che ha una novità rilevante presente nel decreto su un pezzo sicuramente particolare e marginale che però, dopo tanto tempo, vede finalmente un'impostazione corretta e positiva, a mio modo di vedere. È la questione della soluzione del nodo, anche complicato e drammatico, del futuro degli istituti musicali pareggiati (articolo 19 del decreto-legge). Può sembrare un argomento molto laterale (sicuramente non è cruciale come tanti altri), però in molte città e capoluoghi del nostro Paese questo tema è rilevante e fa parte di una complessiva iniziativa necessaria per il rilancio della cultura e dell'educazione musicale nel nostro Paese. <p> Prendo atto positivamente - dobbiamo dirlo - del fatto che il decreto del ministro Carrozza e del Governo contiene tre impegni importanti, che voglio riassumere. Il primo è di una messa a disposizione di risorse, che sono state anche aumentate dalla Camera (quindi, il dibattito ha avuto anche un suo esito positivo), per venire incontro ad una situazione drammatica e di sopravvivenza di questi istituti, fino ad oggi retti da Comuni e Province e, in qualche caso, da qualche contributo regionale, che rischiano di franare per le difficoltà della finanza locale. Questo è un primo impegno positivo. <p> Ce n'è un secondo che riguarda l'apertura di un tavolo tecnico impegnato a definire un programma complessivo di riorganizzazione di tutto il settore. <p> E poi, soprattutto, c'è l'idea della costruzione di un sistema unitario in cui i conservatori e gli istituti musicali pareggiati, come già dice la legge, sono parti di un sistema unitario. <p> Penso che dobbiamo valorizzare questi risultati e impegnarci poi ad una traduzione pratica, non appena il decreto sarà operativo.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6802387237548828, 0.3197612762451172]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> RANUCCI (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il collegato fiscale rappresenta il primo passo della nuova sessione di bilancio. Una sessione, quest'anno, che inizia in un contesto macroeconomico che permette di essere fiduciosi per il futuro. Il quadro è complessivamente diverso da quello dell'inizio della legislatura e ci ha visto duramente impegnati nel corso di questi anni. Per quanto riguarda l' iter parlamentare, è stato condotto un intenso e faticoso lavoro di miglioramento e arricchimento del testo, che ha consentito di arrivare oggi in Assemblea con un testo condiviso. Per tale motivo voglio ringraziare la disponibilità e la collaborazione del vice ministro Morando e del presidente Tonini. Durante i lavori in Commissione bilancio sono state apportate numerose e sostanziali modifiche di integrazione al testo, che nel loro insieme hanno confermato l'impianto generale del provvedimento e migliorato alcuni aspetti, ampliando significativamente i settori di intervento. A questo punto vorrei soffermarmi su alcune modifiche approvate nel corso dell'esame in sede referente. Con riferimento alle imprese, voglio citare l'incremento della dotazione del Fondo di garanzia per le piccole e medie imprese che può essere anche integrato dall'intervento di Cassa depositi e prestiti. Si tratta di un'iniziativa che aumenta notevolmente le potenzialità finanziarie dei confidi e che va nella direzione di sostenere, attraverso questo intervento, il mondo delle imprese. In tema di salute, vorrei ricordare che viene introdotto un regime di detraibilità in via sperimentale, per due anni, degli alimenti a fini medici speciali. Si tratta di alimenti indispensabili in alcune patologie di malassorbimento per le quali, date l'estensione e la diffusione nella società italiana, riteniamo importante sperimentare quest'intervento, aiutando coloro che ne soffrono attraverso la possibilità della detrazione. Inoltre, mi sembra molto importante la norma approvata sulla vendita delle sigarette elettroniche, che in queste ore sta provocando molta polemica. Sul fronte delle vendite di sigarette elettroniche contenenti nicotina, abbiamo previsto il divieto di vendita online, stabilendo che questa sia possibile solo attraverso il circuito delle tabaccherie e dei rivenditori specializzati autorizzati. Abbiamo ritenuto che la tutela della salute avesse la priorità rispetto ad una libera e non controllata commercializzazione di questi prodotti via web. Infatti la norma fa riferimento soltanto alle sigarette elettroniche che contengono nicotina. Facciamo chiarezza sul punto. A causa della mancanza di controlli amministrativi che hanno permesso una serie di comportamenti elusivi ed evasivi di alcune aziende, lo Stato, sulla vendita di sigarette elettroniche, ha incassato solo 4 milioni sui 115 previsti su base annua. Non solo. In virtù del contenzioso pendente presso la Corte costituzionale dopo un rinvio del TAR, queste stesse aziende hanno applicato l'imposta di consumo non sulla quantità del liquido (come previsto) ma solamente sulla quantità di nicotina pagando così solo un decimo di quanto dovuto al fisco. Un'autentica truffa ai danni delle tasche degli italiani. Ma non è finita qui. A causa di questa giungla amministrativa e contabile il commercio online di prodotti contenenti nicotina ha potuto così proliferare soprattutto con il commercio su siti web di aziende estere e permettendo che alcune vendite non venissero regolarmente registrate e dichiarate. Grazie a tale caos, questi prodotti vengono a tutt'oggi venduti senza alcun controllo (sanitario e fiscale) anche dentro negozi non autorizzati dove il liquido viene addirittura diluito così da ottenere un quantitativo superiore da vendere. Ecco perché, con il nostro emendamento, ho voluto non solo porre fine ad un autentico traffico illegale di nicotina ma, soprattutto, permettere che ogni singolo prodotto messo in vendita sia preceduto da un controllo che ne permetta la tracciabilità e il recupero di un gettito di circa 10 milioni di euro ad oggi non versato a danno delle tasche di tutti gli italiani. Proprio poche ore dopo l'approvazione del mio emendamento è arrivata sia una sentenza della Corte costituzionale che finalmente fa chiarezza sulla norma in questione, sia una circolare dei Monopoli di Stato che annuncia la chiusura dei siti che vendono prodotti a base di nicotina non a norma. Insomma, la legalità ha avuto la meglio nonostante le minacce, anche di morte e anche personali, che in queste ore sto ricevendo sui social e in privato solo per aver voluto il rispetto delle regole e il pagamento di un'imposta evasa ed elusa. Tutti noi paghiamo le tasse: ora si adegui anche chi, fino ad oggi, ha guadagnato milioni di euro su un commercio illecito a scapito della salute (e delle tasche) di tutti noi. Permettereste ai vostri figli di acquistare prodotti a base di nicotina senza che vi sia alcun controllo? E per quale motivo questi signori dovrebbero continuare ad evadere le tasse? Le regole sono uguali per tutti. E da oggi, finalmente, anche per chi protesta a causa della cessazione di un privilegio abusivo, illegale e pericoloso. In Commissione abbiamo risolto, attraverso un emendamento sottoscritto da numerosi Gruppi politici, la questione concernente l'uscita dei minori di quattordici anni da scuola, emersa a seguito di una recente sentenza della Corte di cassazione. A tale riguardo si prevede che i soggetti esercenti la responsabilità genitoriale possano autorizzare le istituzioni scolastiche a consentire l'uscita autonoma dei ragazzi dai locali scolastici, ma anche di consentire agli stessi di usufruire in modo autonomo del servizio di trasporto scolastico gestito dagli enti locali mediante una liberatoria che esonera il personale scolastico e gli enti stessi da ogni responsabilità connessa all'adempimento degli obblighi di vigilanza. Altra questione di stretta attualità che con il provvedimento in esame intendiamo risolvere è la prassi della fatturazione a ventotto giorni, elemento da riformare ai fini della tutela dei consumatori. Si tratta di una pratica adottata sempre più frequentemente negli ultimi anni dagli operatori della telefonia mobile e della televisione e che rischiava anche di diffondersi con un meccanismo a tratti ingannevole nei confronti dei cittadini. Al riguardo, si è introdotta una disposizione che, anche in linea con gli orientamenti successivi dell' authority, prevede il ritorno della fatturazione su base mensile (o di multipli del mese) con la sola esclusione, nell'ambito della telefonia mobile, delle offerte promozionali temporanee. È importante, inoltre, una misura a favore dei futuri giovani imprenditori del Mezzogiorno, perché con la misura «Resto al Sud» avevamo previsto che si potesse accedere a questa opportunità fino al limite del complimento dei trentacinque anni, ma i tempi più allungati della sottoscrizione della convenzione con Invitalia e dell'apertura del bando ci hanno suggerito di estendere la possibilità a chi aveva compiuto, alla data di approvazione della norma, il trentacinquesimo anno di età, mantenendo questo termine, quindi consentendo anche a chi ha superato quell'anno di poter accedere a tale misura. Infine vorrei soffermarmi sul principio dell'equo compenso. L'introduzione dell'equo compenso per la professione degli avvocati contiene già in sé la prospettiva per un allargamento alle altre realtà professionali. Siamo riusciti in questo modo a rispondere alle richieste che da tempo questo settore ci avanzava, determinando una norma che possiamo ritenere l'architrave di un sistema che in futuro potrà estendere a tutti i professionisti l'equo compenso. Siamo fiduciosi che nel prossimo futuro, a partire dal disegno di legge di bilancio, possano essere introdotti nel nostro ordinamento alcuni temi che, pur ampiamente condivisi, non hanno trovato spazio nel decreto-legge per le tempistiche ristrette, ma troveranno sicuramente terreno fertile nella manovra di bilancio. Mi riferisco ai temi relativi ai contributi dei lavoratori autonomi per l'assistenza sanitaria gestita da enti bilaterali; alla questione dei lavoratori socialmente utili (LSU) in alcuni enti locali, alla valorizzazione e il sostegno dell'attività dei caregiver, alla proroga della cassa integrazione e guadagni nel settore della pesca. Per concludere, riteniamo che le norme del decreto-legge in discussione, potenziate con il prezioso contributo del Parlamento, rappresentino un ulteriore passo verso la piena ripresa del nostro sistema economico e produttivo, un contributo alla tutela di cittadini e delle famiglie e una decisa spinta verso una fase di crescita strutturale del Paese. La prossima legge di bilancio deve essere l'occasione per rafforzare e consolidare tali prospettive. Per tutti questi motivi, il Gruppo Alternativa Popolare voterà convintamente la fiducia al Governo sul provvedimento in esame, avendo fortemente e in maniera determinata contribuito al miglioramento dello stesso.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5076741576194763, 0.4923257827758789]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, signora Ministro, vedo che finalmente, dopo due anni di sonnecchiante e colpevole attesa, qualcosa si sta muovendo, quasi che un sussulto di orgoglio abbia scosso le nostre coscienze.

E comunque, per una vicenda come questa, gli indizi di colpevolezza, in attesa dei capi di imputazione, non giustificano certamente il sequestro dei nostri due militari in terra indiana. <p> Pertanto, ritengo che l'Italia, e con essa l'Europa e le comunità internazionali (perché non ci sono dubbi sulla multilateralità del problema, con buona pace di Ban Ki-moon), debbono esigere il rispetto del diritto internazionale e una rapida soluzione del caso, richieste queste veicolate anche dagli ambasciatori dei Paesi membri dell'Unione europea, degli Stati Uniti d'America e dall'ambasciatore dell'Unione europea, nonché dai membri di una delegazione dei diversi Gruppi parlamentari italiani che, molto opportunamente, si è recata a New Delhi alla fine del mese di gennaio. <p> Ci auguriamo che ella, signora Ministro, abbia acquisito gli appoggi e le convergenze necessarie per internazionalizzare questo caso. Le sue dichiarazioni di oggi e quanto emerge dalla sua chiara relazione ci inducono a sperare, vista l'opinione del Governo italiano sulle affermazioni del Segretario Generale dell'ONU e sulle iniziative che si intendono adottare in sede di Nazioni Unite per sostenere la posizione italiana e gli ulteriori passi che il Governo intende intraprendere in sede europea e multilaterale. L'auspicio è che in Italia la linea della fermezza si faccia strada, poiché considerare i due marò terroristi significa considerare l'Italia stessa un Paese terrorista, ed è inaccettabile per l'Italia, ma anche per l'Europa di cui facciamo parte. <p> Proprio in questo contesto desidero evidenziare il ruolo importante che il Parlamento italiano deve giocare per sensibilizzare la comunità internazionale - è quello che stiamo cercando di fare con il vostro aiuto - e per sollevare la questione con i rappresentanti delle istituzioni europee e con i suoi omologhi di altri Paesi. <p> La decisione che la pubblica accusa indiana, dopo due anni di colpevole silenzio, ha formalmente avanzato alla Corte suprema di quel Paese, che l'imputazione dei due militari italiani avvenga nel presupposto dell'applicazione della normativa antiterrorismo e antipirateria, è veramente inaccettabile: si tratta, per l'Italia, di una situazione a dir poco grottesca. È arrivato il tempo di fare quadrato attorno ai nostri fucilieri di Marina. È tempo di mostrare agli indiani e alla comunità internazionale di essere un Paese unito. <p> È passato tanto tempo, troppo tempo, e adesso dobbiamo pretendere che arrivino i risultati e gli attesi riscontri della comunità internazionale. <p> Non ci può consolare il fatto che sulla vicenda l'Unione europea ha fatto sentire la propria voce unitaria, anche se questo è importante e determinante. Il presidente della Commissione europea, José Manuel Barroso, e l'Alto rappresentante dell'Unione per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza, Catherine Ashton, hanno espresso le serie preoccupazioni dell'Unione europea sulla vicenda, che rischia di avere un impatto negativo sugli sforzi profusi dall'UE a livello mondiale nella lotta contro la pirateria. Speriamo che si tratti di un impegno convinto e concreto e non di semplici enunciazioni formali. <p> Tutto il Parlamento italiano segue l'evolvere della vicenda con assiduità e grande preoccupazione, anche in considerazione delle gravi conseguenze che da tale increscioso precedente potrebbero derivare sul piano della certezza del diritto internazionale e della efficacia dell'azione profusa a sostegno della pace e della sicurezza attraverso lo strumento delle missioni internazionali, cui l'Italia contribuisce con convinta determinazione. <p> Per queste ragioni la delegazione delle Commissioni affari esteri e difesa del Parlamento italiano, rappresentativa di tutte le forze politiche, ha fatto bene a fine gennaio a recarsi a Delhi, dove ha incontrato i rappresentanti diplomatici di alcuni Paesi europei, insieme al capo della delegazione dell'Unione europea, rinnovando la disponibilità ad avviare un canale di diplomazia parlamentare che contribuisca ad accelerare la soluzione positiva della controversia anche se, come è noto, nessun rappresentante delle istituzioni indiane ha avuto la cortesia e il buon senso di incontrare la delegazione; un atteggiamento, questo delle autorità indiane, irritante, di prevaricante e inaccettabile chiusura nei nostri confronti. <p> Sentiamo quindi la necessità che si proceda senza indugi nel rispetto del diritto internazionale e che ai militari siano assicurate tutte le garanzie dello Stato di diritto, a partire dalla possibilità che essi possano immediatamente rientrare nel proprio Paese, tenuto conto che da due anni sono soggetti a una misura di restrizione della libertà personale in assenza di un attendibile capo di imputazione. <p> Pertanto, signora Ministro, a nome del Gruppo <PARTY> desidero esprimere un grazie sentito per la sua tempestiva presenza in Aula e manifestare ancora una volta l'impegno dei nostri parlamentari e la disponibilità per ogni iniziativa che il Governo intenda intraprendere per addivenire a una soluzione positiva della delicata questione, mettendo al primo posto l'interesse della vita e del destino dei nostri marinai ma, non per ultima, la difesa orgogliosa della dignità della nostra Nazione e della nostra nobile tradizione di impegno e distinzione nelle missioni internazionali di pace.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.545424222946167, 0.45457571744918823]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, molti colleghi hanno ricordato, con accento negativo, che questo è l'undicesimo decreto-legge che ci apprestiamo a convertire. <p> A me sembra che questa constatazione sia la testimonianza dell'impegno del Governo e del Parlamento in una vicenda difficilissima e di altissima complessità. Si trattava e si tratta di conciliare interessi tutti meritevoli di tutela: il diritto e l'interesse a un ambiente salubre, il diritto al lavoro, l'interesse nazionale a mantenere la produzione in un settore strategico quale quello siderurgico. <p> Il Governo ha fatto questo percorso, accidentato e necessariamente work in progress, ispirandosi al ragionevole bilanciamento di questi diritti fondamentali. Questo percorso è stato avallato dalla Corte costituzionale con la sentenza n. 85 del 2013, che ha rigettato e dichiarato inammissibili le questioni di legittimità costituzionale sollevate dalla procura di Taranto con riferimento al secondo dei decreti-legge di questa serie, individuando proprio nell'azione del Governo questo ragionevole bilanciamento tra interessi e valori tutti primari. Infatti, nell'ambito dei diritti fondamentali garantiti dalla prima parte della Costituzione, non ve ne è uno che prevale sull'altro. Il nostro compito - del Parlamento e del Governo - è quello di tutelarli, contemperarli e bilanciarli tutti. Come hanno detto in maniera chiara i relatori, il provvedimento in esame si rende necessario, da un lato, per rispondere a indicazioni che ci vengono dalla Commissione europea e, dall'altro, per agevolare la conclusione di questo percorso con la cessione del complesso industriale a un gruppo che riprenda a pieno ritmo l'attività produttiva e garantisca i livelli occupazionali. Al primo obiettivo risponde lo spostamento sull'amministrazione straordinaria dell'onere del rimborso dei 300 milioni di prestito; al secondo obiettivo risponde, per esempio, la possibilità per gli offerenti di proporre modifiche al piano ambientale. È vero che il piano ambientale è stato adeguato alle migliori tecniche disponibili con quattro anni di anticipo: entrato in vigore in tutta Europa a metà del 2016, il piano ambientale è stato adeguato a quelle tecniche già nel 2012. Siamo nell'ambito della tecnica, della scienza e della tecnologia ed è possibile che vengano proposte soluzioni migliori, più efficaci e magari meno costose, che debbono essere valutate, così come previsto dal decreto-legge, in sede di valutazione delle offerte dal comitato di esperti, prima dell'individuazione dell'aggiudicatario. Risponde a questa esigenza anche l'aspetto, da tutti giudicato scabroso, dell'esenzione ed esclusione della responsabilità penale o amministrativa per atti che siano attuativi del piano ambientale e non per un'area di impunibilità. Per l'attuazione del piano ambientale si garantisce che una violazione formale non dia adito a sequestri e non determini ulteriori stop al processo di risanamento di quell'area e alla ripresa dell'attività produttiva. Concludo dicendo che il Governo fa bene a difendere questo settore e a puntare i piedi in Europa, chiedendo di rivedere le norme sugli aiuti di Stato alla siderurgia. Mi fa specie che chi ogni giorno grida contro quest'Europa dei vincoli, dell'ottusità e dei limiti, poi richiami le procedure di infrazione che l'Unione europea attiva nei nostri confronti quando si tratta di difendere un interesse nazionale. <p> Chiudo con una battuta sola. In una situazione di sovracapacità produttiva dell'acciaio e della siderurgia c'è l'interesse di altri Paesi che premono sull'Europa perché Taranto chiuda, ma è interesse dell'Italia che Taranto rimanga aperta.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5494617223739624, 0.4505382776260376]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, io vorrei ringraziare la vice presidente Fedeli, la collega senatrice Fedeli, per essere stata la ispiratrice di questa mozione, che ho sottoscritto in maniera davvero convinta insieme ad altre colleghe e - lo sottolineerei - altri colleghi. Su questo tema, infatti, non può esserci una discriminazione di interpretazione o di sensibilità. <p> Questo è un tema che inerisce i fondamenti dei diritti umani, che, appunto essendo fondamentali, appartengono a tutti e ad ognuno. I dati sono certamente drammatici. Sono stati richiamati negli interventi che mi hanno preceduto. Ricordiamo che ogni sette secondi nel mondo una ragazza di meno di quindici anni si sposa, spesso con un uomo molto più grande di lei. A tutt'oggi abbiamo più di 700 milioni di donne sposate prima dei diciotto anni, delle quali un terzo sposate prima dei quindici anni. <p> Certo, sono dati statistici sicuramente non rispondenti con precisione e puntualità al vero dato di fatto, e devo pensare che possono essere nient'altro che sottostimati. In ragione anche di una stima futura, si prevede che nel 2030 oltre 950 milioni di donne saranno sposate, e giovanissime. E nel 2050, addirittura oltre un miliardo e mezzo di giovani minorenni saranno costrette a matrimoni che (è importante richiamarne l'aggettivazione) saranno precoci e forzati. Questo vuol significare che c'è tutta una sofferenza che caratterizza la questione a livello mondiale. <p> Secondo alcuni - i famosi titolari del ben altro pensiero, coloro che ritengono che ci siano ben altri problemi - trattare questi temi oggi, nell'attualità economica internazionale, nella dialettica politica nazionale ed europea, può rappresentare un argomento ancillare, che va cioè a occupare un piano sottostante. <p> A me così non sembra, perché quando un'Aula del Senato si confronta su queste tematiche, quando tratta i diritti fondamentali, riconosce la nobiltà non solo dell'argomento, ma anche dell'istituzione che i senatori rappresentano. <p> Qualcuno ha detto che questi dati caratterizzano solamente alcune zone del mondo. A me non risulta, perché da un'indagine più approfondita, se è vero che nell'Africa subsahariana si contano approssimativamente (e per difetto) circa 39 milioni di matrimoni precoci e forzati, è altrettanto vero che, alla luce di altri dati, l'Europa non è esente dal fenomeno: in Europa ne abbiamo quantificati circa 12 milioni; ancor meno sono esenti il Medio Oriente, con 18 milioni, l'America latina e i Caraibi con 25 milioni e l'Asia meridionale con oltre 32 milioni. <p> Questi sono dati effettivamente drammatici che si richiamano a fondamenti culturali, ma non porrei la questione sotto un profilo squisitamente religioso, in quanto divisivo e conflittuale, ma secondo un'ottica laica: una laicità che ci fa dire che i diritti fondamentali che non vengono riconosciuti e che sono mortificati e offesi, non hanno solamente una collocazione di ordine religioso, ma diventano il portato di una cultura in cui alcune figure si trovano ad assumere una posizione subordinata ad altre nell'assetto sociale. Credo che questo sia il tema che deve coinvolgere il Senato nei possibili provvedimenti che ne conseguiranno. <p> Mi ha molto colpito il rapporto, che è stato evocato anche negli interventi precedenti, curato da Save the Children, in cui si richiamano in particolare tre tipi di libertà: la prima forma di libertà - ricordando con questo anche Isaiah Berlin e il suo famoso saggio «Due concetti di libertà» - è la cosiddetta libertà negativa, che consiste nel liberarsi dalla violenza; Save the Children parla appunto di free from harm. Ma si parla anche di una libertà positiva, perché senza liberarsi dalla violenza non si è neanche liberi di vivere e di aprirsi all'informazione, alla cultura e all'educazione. Quindi, si passa dalla libertà dalla violenza alla libertà di vivere: free to live - come afferma Save the Children - e free to learn, ossia liberi di accedere alle fonti educative. Credo che il passaggio principale sia proprio questo. È vero, ogni volta che si trattano alcuni temi, si dice che è un tema di ordine culturale: sono d'accordo che si tratti di un tema di ordine culturale, ma di una cultura pre-politica, che ci dà la possibilità, avendo delineato valori e principi di riferimento, di coniugare veramente la politica con il bene comune. Non è un problema solamente nazionale. A me fa molto piacere che sia presente oggi, oltre che per competenza sull'argomento e per sensibilità personale, anche come rappresentazione istituzionale, il Sottosegretario per gli affari esteri, che dà la dimostrazione di come evidentemente questo sia un tema che deve interessare anche la diplomazia e i contatti a livello internazionale. Infatti, è vero che la cultura viene affermata attraverso l'enunciazione di alcuni principi (Carta dei diritti fondamentali, Convenzione sui diritti dell'infanzia e dell'adolescenza), ma è anche vero che lo stesso Consiglio dei diritti umani delle Nazioni Unite ha adottato, il 1° luglio 2015, la prima risoluzione sui matrimoni precoci e forzati. Noi stessi abbiamo provveduto, in ragione della Convenzione del Consiglio d'Europa, a concretizzare in Italia una legge che ratifica, appunto, la Convenzione sottoscritta ad Istanbul l'11 maggio del 2011. Il passaggio che a me preme sottolineare però è il seguente: l'enunciazione di principi e il riconoscimento dei diritti sono sicuramente fondamentali, ma non possono essere esaustivi, perché i principi e i valori di riferimento non devono essere imposti con la forza, ma trasmessi attraverso una procedura di ordine diplomatico, culturale ed economico che fa sì che, attraverso lo sviluppo sociale, si possano trarre le giuste conseguenze. Si potrebbe immediatamente pensare che ci sia una disparità ovvia tra una dimensione di libertà declinata in alcune realtà del mondo e una libertà negata in altre realtà del mondo. Non vorrei però che questa libertà positiva di alcune realtà nel mondo venga trasferita in altre in senso di imposizione, in senso di comando, addirittura con la stessa violenza. Credo che questo sia un aspetto importante, perché il processo educativo e la dimensione culturale passano attraverso gli organi a livello internazionale, ma devono essere trasferiti e fatti propri attraverso un procedimento che richiede non solo diplomazia, ma anche giusti contatti. Infatti, lentamente con il progresso e con l'evoluzione si dà luogo anche alla riduzione, se non alla scomparsa, di un fenomeno estremamente drammatico. Io credo che questo sia uno degli aspetti che maggiormente caratterizzano la trattazione di questo tema. Ho voluto sottoscrivere convintamente - come dicevo all'inizio del mio breve intervento - questa mozione, perché essa delinea dei punti ben precisi di un percorso che il Parlamento stesso può portare a termine o che d'altra parte, attraverso altri tipi di provvedimenti, può consentire di conseguire un risultato tanto auspicato. Infatti in questa mozione si chiede al Governo di attivarsi, nelle sedi internazionali, al fine di garantire il pieno rispetto, da parte dei Paesi che ne sono firmatari, della Convenzione sui diritti dell'infanzia e dell'adolescenza; ad assumere tutte le opportune iniziative per la piena attuazione della risoluzione del Consiglio dei diritti umani delle Nazioni Unite, alla luce della grave violazione dei diritti umani, oltre che di ogni principio di civiltà, che comporta il perpetrarsi della pratica dei matrimoni forzati; per ultimo, ma non ultimo, a valutare in uno scambio sinergico con il Parlamento l'opportunità di dotare l'Italia, in linea con l'esempio virtuoso della Svezia (già menzionata), di un'apposita normativa, al fine di configurare quale nuova fattispecie delittuosa il matrimonio forzato e tutte le attività connesse. Signor Presidente, le chiedo solamente pochissimi secondi, senza andare oltre il tempo che mi è stato indicato. Vorrei richiamare in quest'Aula, in maniera molto breve, quanto Malala ebbe a riportare nel discorso alla cerimonia per il premio Nobel conseguito il 10 dicembre 2014, all'età di appena diciassette anni. C'è un passaggio del suo intervento che credo vada a sintetizzare nobilmente quello che ho cercato di trasmettere ai colleghi: che sia l'ultima volta - così dice Malala - che un bambino o una bambina spendono la loro infanzia in una fabbrica, che sia l'ultima volta che una bambina sia costretta a sposarsi e che sia l'ultima volta che un bambino innocente muoia in guerra. Che vuol dire questo? Vuol dire che ciò di cui stiamo trattando oggi è un aspetto, ma non è il solo, di tutte le violenze e di tutte le vessazioni ( violenze che vengono somministrate), di tutta la marginalità e di tutto l'abbandono che sono a carico degli adolescenti e dei bambini. Si tratta quindi di un problema che ci coinvolge e che fa dire alla stessa Malala: che sia l'ultima volta che una classe resti vuota e che sia l'ultima volta che ad una bambina venga detto che l'istruzione è un crimine e non un diritto.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5840281248092651, 0.41597190499305725]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> D'ADDA (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, colleghi, con questo intervento di fine seduta continuo, oggi, al Senato, una staffetta con cui, assieme a tante senatrici e tanti senatori, ricordiamo ogni donna che viene uccisa per mano di un uomo a cui è o è stata legata da relazione amorosa. Lo faremo fino a che sarà necessario ricordare al Parlamento e al nostro Paese l'urgenza di arginare la violenza nei confronti delle donne. La scorsa settimana, a Busto Arsizio, la mia città, Diana Vrapi Koni è stata uccisa a coltellate dal marito. A lei dedico questo intervento. Ma ancora: A Vergiate, in provincia di Varese, lo scorso 27 maggio, Renata Ottone, di cinquantasette anni, è stata soffocata con un cuscino dal marito, che poi si è suicidato. A Segrate, in provincia di Milano, il 26 maggio, Antonietta di Nunno, una donna di trentacinque anni, è stata uccisa a colpi di pistola dal proprio ex, che si è poi suicidato a sua volta. I due si stavano lasciando, e avevano quattro figli. Ieri, a Venezia, Anastasia Sharukova, è stata uccisa, insieme al suo compagno attuale, che tra l'altro, probabilmente, proviene dalla mia provincia, dal suo ex. <p> D'ADDA (<PARTY>). Grazie, signora Presidente. Non è un caso che questo richiamo venga da una donna. Stavo riferendo il caso di una giovane donna uccisa con il nuovo compagno, dal suo ex. Oggi abbiamo anche saputo che la povera ragazza era incinta. Salgono così a 61 le donne che ricordiamo in questo nostro percorso, iniziato solo il 30 giugno 2016. E sarebbero ancora di più se, a Sanremo, due settimane or sono, una ragazzina di tredici anni non fosse riuscita a salvare in extremis la propria madre, a cui il padre aveva dato fuoco. I dati presentati dall'ISTAT alla fine di marzo al convegno «La violenza sulle donne: i dati e gli strumenti per la valutazione della violenza di genere» ci dicono che il femminicidio è solo la punta dell' iceberg della violenza maschile nei confronti delle donne. In Italia sono oltre 8,3 milioni le donne vittime di violenza psicologica; 4,5 milioni quelle che hanno subìto, nell'arco della propria vita, atti sessuali degradanti e umilianti, rapporti non desiderati e subiti come violenza, abusi o molestie fisiche sessuali gravi, come stupri (653.000) e tentati stupri (746.000). Il 20,2 per cento delle donne tra i sedici e i settanta anni (4,3 milioni) è stata invece vittima di violenza fisica, minacce, schiaffi, pugni o calci. In una minoranza dei casi, l'l,5 per cento, queste violenze hanno portato a danni seri e permanenti, per strangolamento, ustione o soffocamento. Riproponiamo con convinzione il nostro appello. È un appello al Governo tutto e alla Sottosegretaria con delega alle pari opportunità: la cabina di regia monitori l'applicazione, i pregi e i limiti della legge n. 119 del 2013, e soprattutto dia piena e accurata attuazione al piano contro la violenza. Occorrono risorse, ricerca delle cause, formazione. Occorre un impegno forte. Molte delle donne uccise erano madri o, come nel caso di questa povera donna, lo dovevano diventare. Come è stato stimato dal progetto Switch-off, presentato nei mesi scorsi alla Camera, si stima che nel corso degli ultimi dieci anni siano stati almeno 1.600 i bambini e i ragazzi rimasti orfani di madre o di entrambi i genitori se al femminicidio è seguito il suicidio dell'autore. Un dramma nel dramma. E ancora, un appello ai media : si smetta di giustificare, anche solo con un linguaggio sbagliato, gli assassini e di colpevolizzare le donne, anche quando sembrano difendere i loro carnefici. In un giornale locale in Provincia di Varese è comparso di nuovo l'espressione: «dramma della passione». Non c'è passione se stai a guardare per minuti interminabili, anche venti minuti, una donna che muore perché la strangoli. C'è solo il buio di un orrore indicibile. Un appello al Paese, a uomini e donne: sono state più di 120 le donne uccise nel 2016 e oltre 21 in questo 2017. Tra l'altro, il 2016 è un anno in cui gli altri omicidi sono calati. La violenza sulle donne è antica come il mondo, ma oggi vogliamo sperare con forza che una società avanzata, civile e democratica non nutra più le cronache di abusi, omicidi e stupri. Non vogliamo, non possiamo più accettare questa mattanza che ci interpella, ci chiama o meglio grida alla nostra coscienza di persone e di legislatori, ogni volta domandandoci se mai finirà questo passaggio di consegne e ogni volta continuandola per non dimenticare, come oggi.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6100644469261169, 0.38993552327156067]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> ANGIONI (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, senatrici e senatori, prendo la parola per motivare il mio dissenso dalla scelta del Gruppo e la mia mancata partecipazione al voto di fiducia. Ho ritenuto che il disegno di legge sulle unioni civili avesse il suo motivo ispiratore e il suo contenuto più profondo e il suo senso più autentico nel richiamo al principio di non discriminazione. Ma ora, con lo stralcio dell'articolo 5 ritengo che sia stato introdotto in quella normativa un fattore di sperequazione assai grave; una sperequazione, non solo e non tanto tra coppie eterosessuali e coppie omosessuali, ma, in particolar modo, tra figli destinati all'adozione da parte di coppie eterosessuali e figli destinati all'adozione da parte di coppie omosessuali. Dietro questa scelta, c'è io credo una logica ed un approccio culturale che intende negare l'istanza morale che c'è, che può esserci, nella domanda di unione civile, che mira a neutralizzare il valore sociale ed etico di quella stessa unione civile e a ridurla a un mero contratto privato. E c'è una prospettiva, che definirei economicistica, che offre una sorta di scambio tra concessioni di alcune garanzie patrimoniali, ereditarie, previdenziali, fiscali e amministrative in cambio della rinuncia al riconoscimento giuridico e morale dell'unione civile. Ma è esattamente quel riconoscimento giuridico morale dell'unione civile che costituisce il cuore pulsante della questione e il suo senso ultimo e più alto. Io penso che dietro alla discussione pubblica sui diritti sia sottesa un'altra grande questione, ancora più importante e delicata, ed è la questione della dignità della persona e della persona omosessuale. Ebbene, la dignità non è, non può essere, parziale, intermittente e dimidiata. La dignità o è o non è. <p> In questo disegno di legge la dignità si affaccia, ma non è adeguatamente riconosciuta e non è adeguatamente legittimata. Per questa ragione, io non sostengo il disegno di legge in questa nuova versione e non partecipo al voto di fiducia, consapevole che il percorso per la conquista dei diritti delle persone omosessuali è appena agli inizi.

Signor Presidente, intervengo per una valutazione che sta a cavallo tra le questioni tecniche che abbiamo appena valutato in Commissione bilancio e che puntualmente il presidente Azzollini le ha riferito, per consentire a lei, signor Presidente, la valutazione più precisa e corretta dell' iter della legge di stabilità al nostro esame. Dopo aver passato molti giorni a valutare testi, a votarne alcuni e altri no, acquisiamo un maxiemendamento che è frutto, come lei stesso ha dichiarato, di una serie di testi di emendamenti votati, di emendamenti proposti dal Governo e votati e di emendamenti proposti dal Governo e dai relatori, presentati ma anche non votati. È un lavoro corposo, quindi, che si riduce in questo maxiemendamento che riscrive l'intero testo, con una relazione tecnica che è la parte più importante che alla Commissione bilancio spetta esaminare, valutare ed asseverare dal punto di vista politico. Come in modo eufemistico si è prima espresso il presidente Azzollini, è come minimo un testo riferibile a qualche giorno fa, nel mentre si votavano ancora i testi di iniziativa parlamentare e non gli emendamenti del Governo, che al contrario sono la parte più corposa, insieme a quelli dei relatori, del testo sul quale è stata posta oggi la questione di fiducia. Questo testo, Presidente, per la prima volta nella mia modesta esperienza parlamentare, quello cioè sul quale c'è la bollinatura della Ragioneria generale dello Stato, riporta - e non avrebbe dovuto - persino i numeri degli emendamenti parlamentari depositati e poi discussi in Commissione bilancio, insieme agli appunti, e alle parti mancanti. Noi, quindi, nella relazione tecnica che accompagna il maxiemendamento sul quale viene posta la questione di fiducia, leggiamo - per esempio - in merito all'emendamento 3.42 (testo 2), le parole: «Sentire Riccardi», come se questa fosse una formula usuale in una relazione tecnica. Al ministro Saccomanni faccio notare tutto questo. Mi è spiaciuto farlo notare al vice ministro Fassina. È la prima volta che vedo una relazione, sulla quale la Ragioneria generale dello Stato appone la sua bollinatura, scritta in questo modo. Nel merito non entro, perché non siamo nella sede opportuna. Lo saremo fra poco quando entreremo nel merito della discussione generale. Mi limito, quindi, a concludere il mio intervento facendo notare che sta nella sua responsabilità, Presidente, verificare che la relazione e il maxiemendamento siano assolutamente corrispondenti. Non lo abbiamo potuto verificare dalla lettura rapida da noi fatta - ahimè forse troppo rapida - perché, visti i tanti errori riscontrati, sarebbe stato necessario avere la possibilità di farne una più approfondita; mancano addirittura testi ed emendamenti del Governo presentati in Commissione, che non risultano poi valutati dalla relazione tecnica fornita gentilmente dal Ministero dell'economia e dalla Ragioneria generale dello Stato. Credo che questa legge di stabilità meriti di essere valutata in modo migliore e perfezionata in tutte le sue parti. Ciò rientra nella sua responsabilità, Presidente, e mi auguro che voglia dare rassicurazioni all'intera Aula che stiamo votando un testo corretto non tanto e non solo nella sua stesura, sulla quale possiamo magari anche sorvolare, vista la celerità e la fretta con la quale si è lavorato, quanto per quegli effetti finanziari davvero importanti sui saldi di finanza pubblica che la legge di stabilità determina .\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5759179592132568, 0.4240820109844208]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, anche io, come ha fatto la collega Lo Moro, chiedo l'autorizzazione a depositare la relazione scritta, rinunciando ad intervenire in questa fase. <p> CARDIELLO, relatore.

Signora Presidente, ringrazio la signora Sottosegretaria per la risposta, che reputo esauriente e di cui mi dichiaro fin da subito soddisfatto, a partire dell'esito finale cui ha condotto l'intervento del Governo, e nel suo complesso dell'amministrazione penitenziaria, che ha posto rimedio ad una situazione che si presentava alquanto critica e problematica. Mi ritengo soddisfatto soprattutto perché si è trattato di un intervento organico dell'amministrazione pubblica, dei livelli centrali, regionali e locali, e perché sebbene l'unica nota dolente potrebbe essere data dai tempi e dalla distanza della risposta di oggi al mio atto di sindacato ispettivo del 7 aprile 2016, che potrebbero far intendere che ci sia stata un'eccessiva dilazione, in realtà, la complessità della problematica richiedeva tempo e, giustamente, cautele. Posso quindi definire tempestivo l'intervento nel suo complesso, sebbene la risposta possa apparire dilazionata e, per quanto abbiamo ottenuto, persino equilibrato; si è dato infatti riscontro alle denunce fatte dal garante dei diritti delle persone detenute, che hanno trovato poi un riscontro effettivo anche nell'ispezione amministrativa - che oggi apprendiamo essere stata effettuata - e attraverso le prescrizioni che sono state estese a livello regionale. Mi sembra che questo sia un esempio, come ho detto, di organicità, tempestività ed equilibrio, ma soprattutto di efficienza. Spiace che a livello pubblico solo oggi si possa conoscere quanto di positivo è stato fatto. Probabilmente questa dilazione dei tempi si rendeva necessaria per la delicatezza e la riservatezza con cui certe indagini devono essere compiute, affinché vengano svolte con il necessario scrupolo. Credo che, se proprio si debba ancora integrare l'azione del Governo, forse le prescrizioni cui si fa riferimento nella sua risposta potrebbero essere rese pubbliche affinché, oltre all'autorevole parere del Governo circa la piena soddisfazione che queste prescrizioni hanno trovato all'interno dell'amministrazione carceraria, ci possa essere anche una verifica pubblica, nonché del nuovo garante e della stessa amministrazione comunale che viene citata dalle prescrizioni che sono state indicate. Mi associo alla considerazione su quanto questa vicenda, risolta positivamente, contribuisca in senso positivo a insegnare a livello nazionale circa l'importanza della figura del garante dei diritti delle persone detenute. Abbiamo in questo caso la dimostrazione di come l'interazione tra l'amministrazione penitenziaria e la figura del garante possa portare a notevoli miglioramenti. Anche quanto annunciato dal Governo mi sembra essere molto positivo. A questo punto vorrei semplicemente ringraziare il garante, che ha consentito che tutto ciò emergesse con la sua lettera di dimissioni e la denuncia di quanto, dal suo punto di vista, non era corretto. Le dimissioni del dottor Francesco Racchetti non sono state un atto formale ma sostanziale, utile non solo all'amministrazione penitenziaria, la casa circondariale di Sondrio, ma, credo, a tutto il nostro sistema penitenziario.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.532698392868042, 0.467301607131958]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto in dissenso dal mio Gruppo. <p> AUGELLO (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, non voglio ripetere concetti già sviluppati da altri colleghi nel corso del dibattito. In linea di massima, fatico, pur avendo ascoltato con attenzione il collega Casini, a immaginare la ratifica di questa adesione alla NATO come un momento di protagonismo da parte del nostro Paese e del nostro Parlamento. La questione è centrale e non si tratta semplicemente di fare un dibattito anacronistico tra atlantisti e antiatlantisti. È evidente che l'Alleanza atlantica ha cambiato di segno la sua missione e non sempre si riesce a leggere come un'alleanza difensiva. In questo momento, caso mai, dovremmo dibattere su quanti ritengono si debba, con forza, cercare una soluzione ai molti focolai che si sono accesi nei rapporti tra la NATO e la Federazione russa, in particolare nell'ambito degli scenari in cui questi attriti si sono sviluppati, che non sono soltanto le recenti manovre in Lituania: il problema principale è come dobbiamo regolarci nel rapporto con la Federazione russa, anche relativamente alla più complessa vicenda che si sta dipanando in Siria e nella lotta al terrorismo. Da questo punto di vista, credo che nessuno in quest'Assemblea ci possa convincere che l'adesione della Repubblica di Montenegro alla NATO sia un fatto significativo sul piano militare. Dubito che i contingenti del Montenegro possano arricchire la capacità persuasiva e deterrente dell'alleanza militare. Credo che si tratti, con tutta evidenza, di una decisione politica, che cade in un preciso momento politico e che rischia di acuire una ben definita e determinata tensione politica che sta attraversando il nostro sistema di relazioni internazionali. Credo che si debba segnalare un disagio. Signora Presidente, onestamente non ho mai creduto che si potesse essere atlantisti o antiatlantisti come si è di una squadra di calcio a un derby : della Roma o della Lazio. L'atlantismo ha avuto un suo ben preciso ruolo nella stabilizzazione dell'Europa del dopoguerra. Era un po' difficile, magari, essere atlantisti in assoluto dopo il Cermis e dopo Ustica. Si tratta di un sistema di alleanze che ha svolto la sua funzione storica, ma oggi siamo in un momento storico diverso e - vivaddio! - abbiamo la possibilità di concorrere, approfondendo tutte le questioni, affinché questo nuovo corso ci veda, non dico protagonisti, ma almeno coprotagonisti nel decidere chi siano gli amici e i nemici del momento di fronte alla sfida del terrorismo. Non credo sia stata un'enfatizzazione ricordare lo spirito di Pratica di Mare. La chiave delle relazioni internazionali, che ci può portare ad approdare a una risposta più corale alle grandi sfide che vengono in questo momento dal grande arco di crisi, che va oramai purtroppo dalla Turchia fino alla Libia, passa attraverso quello spirito. Mi sento, quindi, nella condizione di dover sottolineare questo disagio ed è per questo che, in dissenso dal mio Gruppo, su questo provvedimento esprimerò un voto di astensione.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.500248908996582, 0.4997510313987732]}, {'sequence': 'Presidente Draghi, il presidente della Federazione Russa Vladimir Putin ha recentemente dichiarato che la Russia vuole riprendersi i territori che le appartengono e tornare ai suoi confini storici. Questo vuol dire non solamente tutti i confini dell\\'Unione Sovietica (quindi Ucraina, Moldavia, Paesi baltici e Georgia), ma, se conosciamo la storia, anche i confini zaristi (Finlandia compresa) e parte della Polonia (Varsavia compresa). È chiaro che la Finlandia si è preoccupata e chiede di entrare nella NATO e che anche l\\'Est Europa si preoccupa perché Putin ha dichiarato che ha delle mire su di esso. <p> Le nostre preoccupazioni, però, non finiscono qua, perché le istituzioni russe hanno spiegato finalmente che cosa intendono per denazificare l\\'Ucraina. Ce lo hanno spiegato dicendo che l\\'Ucraina non esiste, non esiste la Nazione ucraina, non esiste il popolo ucraino, non esiste una lingua ucraina. Ma la propaganda nazista, dal 1990 in poi, ha creato un nazionalismo ucraino antirusso e, quindi, adesso la Russia con la sua \"operazione speciale\" deve rieducare gli ucraini e far capire loro che non esistono e che sono russi. Ora, a noi che siamo occidentali questa sembra un\\'assurdità, ma a chi è cresciuto nei regimi comunisti e ha grande dimestichezza con i centri di rieducazione tutto questo sembra normale e va in quel verso. <p> A me dispiace dover sprecare dei minuti per eliminare qualche fake news che gira sui nostri media, ma purtroppo anche all\\'interno del Parlamento. La guerra sarebbe stata mossa per fermare il genocidio in Donbass: questa è una fake news russa ripetuta in Italia e anche in Parlamento. Al di là della faccenda che il Donbass non è russo perché, dati alla mano, il 40 per cento del Donbass è abitato da russi, i numeri ufficiali sono i seguenti e sfido l\\'italiano che guarda abitualmente la nostra televisione ad avere questa percezione: i morti civili in Donbass nel 2021 sono stati 25; nel 2020 i morti civili sono stati 26; nel 2019 sono stati 27. Quindi nessun genocidio in corso e nessun genocidio da fermare. Da dove nascono i 14.000 morti di cui sentiamo parlare? Si tratta soprattutto di combattenti ucraini e filorussi coinvolti nell\\'invasione russa del Donbass, in uno schema che conosciamo e che la Russia ripete sistematicamente, cioè creare delle zone di conflitto negli Stati che rivendica: vale per la Transnistria in Moldavia, per l\\'Abkhazia, per l\\'Ossetia del Sud in Georgia, per il Donbass in Ucraina. La Russia vuole semplicemente il dominio sui territori che rivendica, Ucraina compresa. Il problema è che gli altri Stati non sono d\\'accordo con la Russia; non sono d\\'accordo perché la Russia non è uno Stato attrattivo. La Russia è uno Stato povero ed ha un <PARTY>L inferiore a quello dell\\'Italia, nonostante abbia 145 milioni di abitanti. È un Paese che non produce nulla e che esporta solo materie prime come un Paese del terzo mondo. È un Paese con enormi disparità di reddito, con una enorme corruzione, dove Putin e i suoi gerarchi ostentano una ricchezza miliardaria che non si sa bene da dove provenga, mentre 20 milioni di russi non hanno neanche il bagno in casa. Questa è la Russia e non c\\'è da stupirsi se l\\'Ucraina, come il resto dell\\'Est Europa, guarda a Occidente e non alla Russia. Ma la Russia, invece di chiedersi il perché di questo, decide di intervenire con i carri armati. Per fortuna, l\\'Ucraina ha resistito a questa invasione, che secondo qualunque analista militare doveva durare pochi giorni. La Russia ha invaso l\\'Ucraina e quest\\'ultima ha stupito il mondo con una resistenza mai vista prima, senza le armi delle quali ha bisogno. Anche questa menzogna, ripetuta da certi giornalisti - non so se perché pagati dal Cremlino o perché in malafede - e da certe forze politiche, secondo cui l\\'Ucraina è già stata armata a sufficienza, è smentita dagli analisti militari. Gli ucraini combattono con un pezzo di artiglieria ogni venti in possesso dei russi e con minore gittata e minore capacità di fuoco. La resistenza è solamente dovuta all\\'eroismo di quel popolo. L\\'Ucraina sta vivendo il suo Risorgimento, si sta battendo per la propria libertà e per la propria indipendenza. E noi italiani, che il Risorgimento l\\'abbiamo vissuto e che abbiamo trasformato quella che gli altri chiamavano solo un\\'espressione geografica nella nostra Patria, dovremmo avere un\\'empatia nei confronti di quel popolo e del suo Risorgimento. Ma le scelte politiche si fanno non con l\\'empatia, ma con la ragione. E il motivo per cui dobbiamo sostenere l\\'Ucraina ce lo ha già spiegato il presidente di <PARTY> Giorgia Meloni, ed è molto semplice, perché lì sta l\\'interesse nazionale italiano. In primo luogo, le dichiarazioni di Putin sono già molto chiare: se l\\'Ucraina capitola velocemente, poi toccherà ad altri Paesi europei e a noi di <PARTY> non piacerebbe il ritorno dell\\'imperialismo sovietico anche nel terzo millennio. In secondo luogo, molto pragmaticamente, non è l\\'Italia che decide le sorti della guerra in Ucraina; c\\'è un dibattito surreale, come se le armi italiane fossero fondamentali per decidere se l\\'Ucraina riesce a resistere o meno. Ebbene, anche se l\\'Italia dovesse tradire le proprie alleanze internazionali, Regno Unito, Stati Uniti, Australia, Giappone, tutto il resto dell\\'Occidente continuerebbero a difendere l\\'Ucraina. <p> Non cambierebbe, quindi, la sorte della guerra, ma cambierebbero l\\'immagine e la credibilità dell\\'Italia nel mondo, facendola ripiombare in quell\\'immagine di Paese poco affidabile, come spesso è stata dipinta. <p> <PARTY> è il movimento dei patrioti italiani: prendiamo le nostre decisioni sempre e solo nell\\'interesse della Nazione.

Accolgo la sollecitazione che mi è stata fatta e chiedo l'attenzione delle autorità competenti affinché vigilino e accertino la situazione. Tutto questo viene a ricadere nel momento di grave crisi economica che tutto il Paese sta vivendo, in particolar modo al Sud e nella mia Provincia. Come ricorderete, in quest'Aula abbiamo parlato del caso disperato di un signore della città di Vittoria che si è ucciso proprio perché privato della sua casa, che non era riuscito a finire di pagare.

Mi è stato riferito che la sua casa, che aveva comprato insieme al marito dal quale si è separata, è stata venduta per pochissimi soldi rispetto al suo valore e che la signora doveva estinguere ormai solo una piccola somma. Queste notizie creano sconforto e gettano nella disperazione le famiglie. Ripeto, si tratta di una donna sola con due bambini a carico, la quale, nonostante sia quella la sua unica casa e i suoi figli siano minori, subisce lo sfratto. Chiedo pertanto attenzione a tal riguardo e rivolgo un appello alle autorità competenti perché verifichino che tutto questo non abbia a ripetersi, per preservare innanzitutto la serenità dei bambini e delle famiglie che vivendo un'ansia e una preoccupazione profonda, rischiano conseguenze sempre più drammatiche e di vivere traumi che avranno certamente ripercussioni nella loro vita.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6738719940185547, 0.3261280357837677]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> DEL BARBA (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghe e colleghi, il disegno di legge che ci accingiamo a votare interviene sulla legge n. 96 del 2012 in maniera molto semplice, come ricordava la senatrice Bernini, ovvero andando a rinforzare il personale della Commissione di garanzia degli statuti per la trasparenza e il controllo dei rendiconti dei partiti politici. Lo fa con tre articoli di cui si discute in Parlamento dal 13 febbraio del 2015. Lo fa intervenendo su una situazione concreta che vede i bilanci 2013 dei partiti, certificati con gli stessi criteri delle società che si ammettono in borsa, depositati presso la Commissione con tutte le pezze giustificative a supporto di ciascuna voce e fino ad oggi non esaminati. Lo fa su richiesta dello stesso presidente della Commissione di garanzia, come veniva poc\\'anzi ricordato, intervenendo a rendere finalmente operativo ciò che la legge già dispone. Vengono finalmente, semplicemente, assegnate con distacco di cinque unità di personale, dipendenti della Corte dei conti, da applicare alle attività di revisione e di due ulteriori unità di personale, dipendenti da altre amministrazioni pubbliche, da applicare nelle attività di controllo contabile, tutte con le opportune competenze professionali, per esaminare i rendiconti dei partiti politici secondo i dettami di legge. In mancanza del suddetto personale, infatti, la Commissione non è nelle condizioni di svolgere in pieno il proprio mandato. Pertanto il provvedimento, contrariamente a quanto viene sostenuto dal <PARTY> e da chi vi si oppone faziosamente, è finalizzato proprio ad un effettivo e pieno controllo di regolarità con riferimento ai rendiconti dei partiti politici. Per assurdo, chi si esprime contro questo provvedimento non vuole che la Commissione di garanzia funzioni e che i rendiconti del partito di appartenenza siano verificati. <p> Per questi semplici motivi il <PARTY> voterà a favore del provvedimento. <p> Ecco, signor Presidente, dovrebbe terminare qui la dichiarazione di voto su un provvedimento tanto semplice, tanto ovvio, tanto complementare e coerente con quanto già previsto dalla legge. È invece necessario partecipare tutti insieme a questa grande fiction che qualcuno ritiene di poter montare e smontare a suo piacimento ogni volta che si tocchi il tema del finanziamento ai partiti o altro tema che si ritenga sufficientemente interessante e manipolabile. Una fiction che prevede copioni prevedibili e ripetitivi, messe in scena anche piuttosto logore e stantie e soprattutto prescrive la totale mistificazione della realtà. <p> Una fiction in cui si ha la pretesa che noi stessi si faccia da protagonisti e comparse più o meno consapevoli, addirittura in queste aule. Si arriva fino a chiedere alla Presidenza di fungere da aiuto regista <p> : «Spenga il microfono, mi dia la telecamera, mi ridia la parola, prenda al volo questo lancio di Regolamento» <p> , ad invitare sul set comparse e figuranti a cui rivolgersi durante il dibattimento, come fossero un coro greco, interpellare la stampa presente in Aula di continuo affinché riporti quanto appena sostenuto, immortali l\\'inquadratura indicata; mi scuseranno i fotografi se non mi volto, ma preferisco parlare alla Presidenza e all\\'intera Aula <p> Che importa poi se tutto sia completamente destituito di fondamento? <p> È veramente una grande innovazione, quella che viene proposta dal <PARTY>: si passerebbe dal teatrino della politica al grande reality della politica, tutto per il grande spettacolo della rete o presunto tale.

Se serve, come va di moda oggi, costruiamoci sopra una narrazione avvincente, cerchiamo un crimine, un misfatto, e andiamo a caccia del colpevole: vuoi vedere che quei furboni dei partiti hanno nascosto i bilanci o non hanno ottemperato a qualche disposizione di legge?

Vergognati! DEL BARBA (<PARTY>). C\\'è ancora molta strada da fare su questo tema e la faremo con il passo di chi ha la responsabilità di aprire la pista, come abbiamo fatto fin qua. Ecco cosa mostrano i riflettori: la nostra perseveranza, trasparenza, e non esito ad usare anche la parola coraggio. <p> In questo nuovo percorso non vogliamo sottrarci - e concludo, Presidente - come <PARTY>, ai dovuti controlli e per questo intendiamo rafforzare la struttura della Commissione di garanzia degli statuti e per la trasparenza e il controllo dei rendiconti dei partiti politici. <p> Ma allora, come vendiamo questo reality ? Dove troviamo il colpevole se questa volta non è il maggiordomo? Ci sarà almeno qualche cavillo della legge che, infine, non è stato rispettato. Ebbene sì, c\\'è una mucca nel corridoio, un enorme bovino che ci guarda simpaticamente <p> mentre tutti noi - o forse solo qualcuno di noi - cerchiamo di scansarlo facendo finta di non vederlo.

Il nostro ricco mondo culturale necessitava da ormai troppo tempo di una riforma delle complesse disposizioni legislative in materia di organizzazione e gestione delle fondazioni lirico-sinfoniche. <p> Andava rivista e razionalizzata la vigente disciplina in materia di teatro, prosa, musica, danza, spettacoli viaggianti e attività circensi, innovando le disposizioni legislative attraverso la redazione di un unico testo normativo denominato codice dello spettacolo. Il codice dello spettacolo, infatti, razionalizza e semplifica procedure amministrative, razionalizza la spesa e incentiva a migliorare la qualità artistico-culturale delle attività, nonché della fruizione da parte della collettività. <p> Il mondo dello spettacolo dal vivo era dunque in sofferenza per la mancanza di adeguate norme, di adeguate risorse, di adeguata e lungimirante visione prospettica, europea e internazionale. Oggi siamo davanti - come ha osservato nella sua relazione la senatrice Di Giorgi - a una riforma organica. <p> Nei mesi scorsi le numerose audizioni della 7ᵃ Commissione hanno portato alla luce problemi, limiti e difficoltà dei lavoratori dello spettacolo. Molte sono state le testimonianze di organismi, gruppi di professionisti e associazioni che hanno chiesto - e a ciò il disegno di legge ha dato risposta - promozione e sostegno ai vari mondi dello spettacolo e alle diverse espressioni artistiche, ritenute indispensabili allo sviluppo della nostra cultura e alla coesione della nostra identità, alla diffusione e promozione europea e internazionale della nostra arte, veicolo della nostra offerta turistica. Lo spettacolo dal vivo è però anche occasione formativa fondamentale e - come detto poc'anzi - di contrasto a situazioni di disagio psicologico e sociale, presenti nel complesso e variegato mondo della scuola. Esso rappresenta altresì occasione di integrazione di soggetti con difficoltà e disabilità, ma anche e soprattutto di valorizzazione di talenti. Non a caso si prevede che le attività dello spettacolo siano realizzate con il diretto coinvolgimento dei giovani fin dall'infanzia e che una percentuale dei flussi sia destinata alle attività nella scuola; ciò a suggellare il valore educativo, formativo e sociale dello spettacolo, un valore sostenuto con tutti i mezzi. <p> Vanno altresì sostenuti tutti gli operatori dello spettacolo e, pertanto, sono necessari compensi significativi. È notorio che i compensi nel mondo dello spettacolo sono modesti a causa della modesta capacità contrattuale di chi a tale attività si dedica. È necessario invece trovare un più elevato riconoscimento. E lo sforzo in tal senso sui vari settori dello spettacolo c'è stato e sarà affrontato nel corso dell'esame della delega sul lavoro. <p> Alcuni problemi evidenziati dalle associazioni hanno messo in luce le criticità del sistema previdenziale. In particolare, i musicisti hanno invocato provvedimenti per superare le criticità di alcune normative complesse sul lavoro che determinano il conseguente sommerso; le normative previdenziali; gli eccessivi costi delle tariffe Siae e gli insuperabili problemi economici delle scuole di musica. <p> Finalmente, con il presente provvedimento, potremo dare alle professionalità artistiche dei teatri, della danza, della musica, delle attività liriche, concertistiche e corali, delle attività circensi, degli spettacoli viaggianti, dei carnevali storici, delle rievocazioni storiche, ma anche dei complessi bandistici, degli artisti di strada, teatro per i ragazzi, e di tanti altri apporti, degli strumenti importanti di sostegno pubblico e di sviluppo che valorizzino la qualità dell'offerta e delle produzioni, la pluralità e peculiarità dei linguaggi dell'arte. Potremo favorire la diffusione dello spettacolo italiano all'estero, con un'attenzione a tutti, ma specificamente ai giovani artisti, come già sottolineato dalla relatrice. Finalmente sarà favorito il ricambio generazionale in modo da valorizzare i nuovi talenti e l'attenzione alle nuove tecnologie. <p> La redazione di un testo normativo, il codice dello spettacolo, darà quindi maggiore efficacia e organicità sia alle procedure amministrative, sia alla qualità artistico-culturale delle produzioni, incentivando innovazione, razionalizzando e potenziando gli interventi di sostegno dello Stato. È importante che gli interventi vengano armonizzati con quelli degli enti locali, attraverso accordi di programma. <p> Mi piace infine sottolineare quanto questo percorso legislativo complesso, accuratamente seguito dalla Commissione e accuratamente relazionato dalla relatrice, sia stato attento alla valorizzazione dell'enorme patrimonio del nostro spettacolo, alle opere dei giovani artisti emergenti, grazie anche a spazi dedicati nelle piattaforme televisive e alla produzione delle nostre opere in Europa e nel mondo. I giovani artisti in particolare, ma pure gli altri lavoratori del settore, potranno accedere a misure di facilitazione attraverso strumenti di credito agevolato. Quanto ai criteri di riparto del Fondo unico per lo spettacolo, sottolineo la centralità dell'erogazione di contributi che valorizzino la qualità delle produzioni e, quindi, finanziamenti in questo senso selettivi a progetti disposti dai giovani di età inferiore ai trentacinque anni. <p> Non voglio ripetere quello che è già stato detto, ma farò solo un cenno al riequilibrio territoriale: le Regioni colpite dal sisma potranno avvalersi di importanti finanziamenti. <p> Il Consiglio superiore dello spettacolo, infine, ha lo scopo di assicurare compiti di supporto e proposte politiche del settore, di assicurare analisi, monitoraggio e valutazioni alle politiche pubbliche della materia. <p> Concludo esprimendo una soddisfazione viva per la realizzazione di un importante risultato, che vedrà l'aumento delle risorse del FUS, l'instaurarsi di forti collaborazioni con il mondo della scuola, l'estensione dell' art bonus a tutto il mondo dello spettacolo, il riconoscimento giuridico a tante manifestazioni che prima non erano riconosciute. La qualità del provvedimento è davvero un grande e responsabile investimento che ci assumiamo nei confronti delle generazioni future.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5010176301002502, 0.49898239970207214]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> MARINELLO (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, in un breve intervento confermo il voto favorevole del Gruppo parlamentare al quale appartengo sulle proposte di risoluzione oggi all'esame del Senato. In particolare, però, devo aggiungere qualche ulteriore elemento sulla proposta di risoluzione che riguarda la Regione Siciliana, proprio in virtù di alcune argomentazioni che sono state sviluppate in Aula da alcuni colleghi che mi hanno preceduto. In Sicilia dobbiamo registrare un sistema le cui colpe e responsabilità non sono obiettivamente ascrivibili soltanto a chi oggi ha la guida politica della Regione; vi è una somma di errori e di difficoltà, che hanno creato, tra di loro, una sorta di sinergia da potenziamento, che è esplosa negli ultimi anni. Semmai, la colpa principale del presidente Crocetta, che oggi è alla guida politica della Regione, è di non aver assunto in prima persona, fin dal primo momento, la diretta responsabilità dell'intero comparto, delegandola invece ad assessori che, poi, non hanno dimostrato né le capacità, né, soprattutto, a mio avviso, l'equilibrio per tentare di invertire la rotta in una situazione così disastrosa. In questa situazione così confusa, mi permetto di dissentire totalmente dall'intervento che ho ascoltato, esplicitato dal collega della Lega in questa sede, perché l'unico elemento positivo è il tentativo del Ministero dell'ambiente, che da un anno a questa parte, attraverso il concerto preventivo, ha determinato delle ordinanze assolutamente precise e ristrette che non consentono alcuna discrezionalità né alla Regione, né ai gestori del sistema, siano essi pubblici o privati, e comunque ha stabilito delle regole. Negli ultimi mesi si registra comunque un dato positivo, ossia l'aumento della raccolta differenziata e la diminuzione dei volumi trattati. Questi sono dati innegabili. Sono convinto che questa direzione debba vedere - come ho detto nel mio intervento precedente - una responsabilità ancora più forte del Governo nazionale e del Ministero dell'ambiente. Speravo che la rappresentante del Governo avesse ascoltato il mio intervento e magari rispondesse nel merito in sede di replica; comunque, forti delle nostre ragioni, continueremo a sostenerle in tutte le sedi. Per concludere, quella siciliana è una situazione difficilissima, che, come dicevo, stratifica inefficienze e talvolta malaffare da decenni a questa parte. È evidente che non è tutto inefficienza e malaffare; vi sono situazioni a macchia di leopardo, ma, proprio per questo motivo, i dati della relazione oggi al nostro esame sostanzialmente costituiscono una buona base di studio, di verifica e di accertamento e credo che - vivaddio - gli organi responsabili, in particolare le procure della Repubblica, che possono istituzionalmente intervenire in questo settore, da lì possano trarre una serie di valutazioni assolutamente dirimenti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5319504737854004, 0.46804946660995483]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> AUGELLO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, purtroppo in questa dichiarazione di voto dovrò ripetere quello che ho detto nella dichiarazione di voto resa in Giunta. La questione fondamentale che abbiamo sollevato, sia in Giunta che in Assemblea, non soltanto è stata elusa, ma è stata anche confutata negando l'evidenza delle carte. Lo ripeto per l'ultima volta, e spero che colleghi mi prestino attenzione. Non è una mia opinione, senatore Cucca e relatore Stefano, che il signor Paolone Caponera, e non il signor Rosario Caponera, si trovasse a quell'incontro. È scritto a pagina 11 dell'interrogatorio del 30 ottobre 2014 del signor Aiello. È scritto, e non possiamo dire: i Caponera, mezzo Caponera, due Caponera e mezzo. Era presente lì il signor Paolone Caponera, dice il testimone Aiello a pagina 11 dell'interrogatorio. Questo interrogatorio è agli atti della Giunta ma, purtroppo, non posso distribuirlo, signor Presidente, perché sapete che gli atti sono secretati. Ma è in Giunta, e noi non possiamo negare l'evidenza di ciò che ci viene trasmesso da una procura, in questo caso a dir poco temeraria. Il fatto che, relatore Stefano, ci sia una imprecisione nel definire la data di quell'incontro, da parte sempre di questo signor Aiello, è comunque conchiuso in una indicazione temporale che è anche logica. Aiello dice che l'incontro è avvenuto, comunque, o nel 2006 o nel 2007. E per quale ragione? Perché stanno prendendo un accordo, anche di natura elettorale. Ora, colleghi del Senato, ciascuno di noi ha preso, ovviamente non con dei criminali, ma con dei colleghi di partito, degli accordi elettorali. C'è qualcuno in quest'Aula che prende accordi elettorali quattro anni prima delle elezioni? Seriamente ci vogliamo raccontare di avere questo dubbio, davanti alle carte a nostra disposizione in Giunta e che tutti possiamo leggere? In questo caso è evidente che il fumus c'è. Avremmo potuto approfondirlo ma, signor Presidente, lei purtroppo non ce ne ha dato il tempo, come non ce ne ha dato il tempo il presidente Stefano. È implausibile, completamente, che la procura che ci ha mandato queste carte potesse essere inconsapevole del periodo in cui si trovava in detenzione uno dei principali soggetti criminali al centro di questa inchiesta. Signor Presidente, dall'alto della sua esperienza, le faccio questo esempio. Secondo lei il dottor Pignatone a Roma avrebbe potuto costruire l'impianto accusatorio di Mafia capitale se gli incontri rimproverati ai politici, alle cooperative di Buzzi e con Carminati si fossero tutti storicamente svolti nel periodo in cui Carminati era in carcere? Se lei fosse stato il procuratore della Repubblica di Roma e un suo sostituto le avesse portato informazioni del genere, lei, nonostante l'aria normalmente mite e compassata che sempre ha, avrebbe ceduto a un momento di impazienza. O così suppongo. Da questo punto di vista, la questione che noi dobbiamo esaminare non è quella di cedere al pregiudizio della malafede della procura o al pregiudizio dell'inesattezza o della mancanza di capacità di connettere gli atti della procura tra di loro. Noi dobbiamo riconoscere che c'è un fumus, perché noi stiamo parlando di un teste totalmente inattendibile e di una notizia che ci è stata non comunicata dalla procura. La procura ci ha comunicato tutta una serie di intercettazioni, verbali, eccetera e non ci ha comunicato una notizia essenziale: che quando si è svolto quel fatto, dove si è suggellato il patto elettorale (il patto criminale elettorale), purtroppo il criminale principale non c'era. Da questo punto di vista, sostenere seriamente che questa è una questione che noi mettiamo in un angolo e procediamo perché tanto ce ne sono altre (certo che ce ne solo altre), ma alla luce di questa, anche le altre secondo me dovrebbero essere oggetto di una più attenta verifica, ma non è nostro compito. Viceversa è nostro compito dire che c'è il fumus, perché la procura non ci ha trasmesso atti sufficientemente documentati per consentirci di giudicare la richiesta che ci veniva sottoposta. Questo è il lavoro che avrebbe dovuto fare la Giunta. Tuttavia, poiché non ci è stato consentito di fare questo approfondimento, poiché siamo stati costretti ad arrabattarci in quest'Aula a citare le pagine degli atti che ci sono stati trasmessi, perché in Giunta, con gli atti in mano, non abbiamo avuto la possibilità di fare questa discussione, noi non siamo nella condizione di avallare questa procedura. Io personalmente mi rifiuto di avallare procedure di questo genere per mandare in carcere una persona. Non è un atteggiamento possibile. Quindi io personalmente ripeterò quello che ho già fatto in Giunta, cioè mi asterrò per protesta, voterò l'astensione per protesta, perché non sono stato messo in condizione di fare il mio lavoro nella Giunta delle elezioni e delle immunità parlamentari. Per quanto riguarda più complessivamente il Gruppo, io credo con grande equilibrio (perché su queste cose credo che tutti i Gruppi dovrebbero comportarsi così), il nostro Capogruppo ci ha dato il mandato e la possibilità di votare ciascuno secondo coscienza. Mi piacerebbe che ciò accadesse in tutta l'Assemblea del Senato, in tutti i Gruppi, possibilmente utilizzando quelle nervature della coscienza che non si fermano all'avambraccio, ma arrivano fino al polpastrello quando si deve premere il pulsante per decidere cosa fare e a che destino affidare un parlamentare della Repubblica\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5793748497962952, 0.4206251800060272]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> <PARTY>AVONE (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, innanzitutto, a titolo personale, come componente della Commissione istruzione rivolgo un ringraziamento al ministro Franceschini, per la sua costante presenza in Commissione e per lo stile istituzionale (in questo momento serve sottolinearlo) con cui ha continuato a seguire i lavori d'Aula. Rivolgo altresì un ringraziamento al presidente Marcucci, ottimo presidente di Commissione, sempre super partes e bravissimo anche a gestire i momenti di tensione politica che hanno attraversato i lavori della Commissione, con un'attività intelligente ed elastica, che ha consentito comunque il massimo di utilità dei lavori. Grazie alla relatrice Di Giorgi e ai funzionari della Commissione. Abbiamo ascoltato in più di un intervento i toni appassionati con cui abbiamo voluto sottolineare quello che è il più ricco patrimonio del nostro Paese, un giacimento di grande ricchezza culturale. Basti pensare ai 3.609 musei, ai quasi 5.000 siti culturali tra monumenti e aree archeologiche, agli oltre 46.000 beni architettonici vincolati, ai 49 siti dell'UNESCO: un patrimonio di beni materiali e tradizioni immateriali, che è la cosa più preziosa che abbiamo. Aggiungerò quello che abbiamo in Sicilia, circa 111 siti, che fanno sì che la gran parte del patrimonio, il 46 per cento, si trovi proprio al Centro-Sud. Se questo è vero, è altrettanto notorio che non basta possedere questa enorme ricchezza di beni culturali perché automaticamente si attragga una domanda di consumo culturale. Anzi, il nostro territorio si è caratterizzato nel tempo per numerose, troppe emergenze archeologiche, artistiche, di manutenzione, che hanno recato un enorme nocumento alla nostra capacità di attrazione turistico-culturale. Dai dati recenti, risulta che l'Italia, una volta leader mondiale indiscusso per arrivi turistici internazionali, ha perso enormi fette di mercato e quando il turismo da noi cresce, tale crescita è comunque inferiore rispetto a quella che si registra nei Paesi esteri. Tuttavia, il settore turistico è un settore chiave della nostra economia, poiché rappresenta il 10 per cento del <PARTY>L. Al suo interno, il turismo culturale impiega oltre 2 milioni di occupati e il settore culturale da solo produce circa il 5 per cento del <PARTY>L e occupa oltre un milione e mezzo di persone. Bene fa quindi il Governo, come del resto sottolineato dalla brava relatrice stamattina, a collegare questi due settori, il turistico e il culturale, e a prevederne la crescita attraverso politiche coordinate che facciamo parte di un'unica grande strategia di sviluppo e di fruizione. Negli ultimi anni abbiamo assistito a una caratterizzazione dell'intervento pubblico in campo culturale mirante soprattutto a porre in essere politiche di conservazione, piuttosto che politiche di produzione di cultura. E, in effetti, di questa impostazione risente ancora un pochino il decreto che viene alla nostra attenzione oggi, mentre per il futuro confido nell'impegno e nella passione mostrata dal ministro Franceschini perché si possa ribaltare questa relazione. Oggi, infatti, sotto gli influssi devastanti della crisi, non può bastare il solo momento conservativo, pur se questo significa certamente tutelare e sottrarre il nostro patrimonio alla mercificazione e difendere i territori dal depauperamento e dalle logiche dello sfruttamento negativo, perché conservare senza valorizzare non sarebbe certamente un segno di progresso: conservare senza ben gestire il patrimonio culturale equivarrebbe solamente ad un regresso. Ecco perché mi sento di sottolineare in questa sede l'atteggiamento migliore che noi dobbiamo attenzionare, che è quello della «produzione della cultura», cioè aiutare la creazione di nuove espressioni d'arte sia nelle forme tangibili, come i musei, i complessi monumentali, gli archivi, i siti e i reperti archeologici o le biblioteche, sia nelle forme intangibili, come la musica, soprattutto favorendo l'accesso alla cultura attraverso le nuove tecnologie in ogni forma di espressione. L'innovazione, la creazione di nuove professionalità e l'uso intensivo delle tecnologie più avanzate possono generare nuovi modelli di sviluppo del settore culturale e originare benessere economico per la collettività. Lo snodo centrale che consente ai beni culturali di entrare nel grande mondo delle tecnologie avanzate è fondamentalmente quello della digitalizzazione, ovvero la trasformazione di un monumento, un quadro, una scultura in un file elettronicamente trasferibile e da tutti fruibile, seppure con i limiti e l'approssimazione che appartengono a una fruizione virtuale del bene e tuttavia fondamentale per accrescerne la conoscenza. Ora, certamente la conservazione è il requisito propedeutico alla buona produzione culturale, ma la filiera di un bene culturale è un concetto di politica economica, che tende a dare protagonismo a molti altri attori, sia pubblici che privati, declinandone ruoli e compiti. E mi pare che nel presente decreto, dove l'ottica conservazionista, come ho detto, sembra ancora prevalere su quella produttiva, in effetti ravvisiamo, così come nelle parole del signor Ministro, nuovi strumenti interessanti: dal mecenatismo in chiave moderna, alla previsione dei crediti di imposta per chi operi donazioni liberali a favore del sostegno dei luoghi di cultura o per gli interventi di manutenzione. Pur tuttavia, tali strumenti ci sembrano, sì, un passo positivo, ma solo un primo passo rispetto alle esigenze che la globalizzazione del mondo della cultura pone. Per esempio, nel decreto non si tiene abbastanza conto dei processi formativi, atteso che l'incremento della qualità delle accademie, come pure dei programmi pubblici e privati per l'arte e la creatività, è un compito gravoso che spesso la politica ha tralasciato dolosamente. Ma la fase della produzione della cultura non può fare a meno delle idee degli artisti, rispetto alle quali le strutture organizzative, anche costose (voglio ricordare i teatri e l'industria cinematografica), sono un fondamentale strumento di promozione. In queste fasi è importante che il settore pubblico e quello privato si incontrino, che lo Stato faccia di più perché il settore privato sia più generoso, che si ridefiniscano in maniera dettagliata i compiti e il terreno su cui si può collaborare a un livello più alto, anche per coniugare in maniera più efficace la cultura e il turismo. Oggi alzano la voce diversi studiosi di questo rapporto tra cultura e turismo per dire che il modello della mera conservazione, pur essendo importante, è superato perché tale modello creerebbe sinergie limitate con pochi altri settori dell'economia, e tra questi, appunto, il turismo; ci si riferisce in particolare alla piccola impresa di restauro, alla piccola impresa edile, alle società di informatica specializzate in catalogazione, all'editoria specializzata. Il bene culturale è soprattutto indice di un'identità, segno di un percorso di civiltà che deve appartenere con piena coscienza alla comunità territoriale. Su questo decreto è stata posta la fiducia; è un peccato, perché è un buon inizio e già solo il lavoro appassionato del Ministro avrebbe meritato un sostegno generoso e convinto da parte di ciascuno di noi. Purtroppo, dovendosi votare la fiducia, questo decreto non avrà il nostro voto favorevole.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5038727521896362, 0.496127188205719]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, sono qui a dire soprattutto ai cittadini italiani che questo ennesimo amplissimo aiuto o regalo - chiamatelo come volete - a Banca Intesa non salva certo Banca Popolare di Vicenza e Veneto Banca, che vengono appunto liquidate, ma continua a puntellare il sistema bancario italiano, per salvarlo. <p> A Banca Intesa viene permesso di ottenere la parte pulita delle banche venete, senza dover farsi carico della componente passiva. Desidero ricordare che il Banco Santander in Spagna ha acquisito il Banco popular español per un euro, facendosi carico di 7 miliardi di euro di rettifiche sul portafoglio crediti, evitandone così un bail in più esteso e il fallimento. Lo Stato italiano - come è già accaduto - interviene tardi, procrastinando la soluzione di problemi e di iniziative sistemiche, e interviene soltanto ora per offrire a Banca Intesa i gioielli delle banche venete, lasciando allo Stato, e cioè al contribuente, il compito di gestire i crediti deteriorati, gli incagli, i titoli spazzatura: tutto quello che viene causato non solo dalla cattiva gestione delle banche, ma anche e soprattutto dalla crisi del debito privato creato dal sistema euro. L'indipendenza della Banca centrale europea dal controllo democratico degli Stati è il principio che sta distruggendo la democrazia e la fiducia degli italiani nella politica e nel suo sistema economico. E al riguardo c'è un dibattito aperto fuori da qui. Dobbiamo abbandonarla al più presto, creando un nuovo modello di relazioni tra Stato, mercato e società. Da millenni la moneta è attributo del sovrano: sulle antiche monete troviamo le effigi dei monarchi. Finché il sovrano è stato espressione diretta ed esplicita dei potentati economici, tutto è filato liscio. Poi sovrano è diventato il popolo e improvvisamente quello che era dato per pacifico, cioè l'esercizio della sovranità monetaria, è stato demonizzato, dalla Destra come dalla Sinistra, finché non si è riusciti a estirparlo dal perimetro del controllo democratico degli elettori, per riporlo al riparo del processo elettorale. E ora, con la totale sottoposizione dei Governi alla Commissione europea e alla BCE, non esiste proprio più nessuna tutela, neppure costituzionale. Così, i potentati economici hanno ripreso il sopravvento e le decisioni di un popolo, che siano il referendum contro l'austerità in Grecia, o la scelta di utilizzare il Fondo interbancario di tutela dei depositi per salvare banche in Italia, sono soggette al loro sindacato, al loro ricatto. Con questo non voglio certo dire che le responsabilità del consiglio di amministrazione e degli alti amministratori di Banca Popolare di Vicenza SpA e di Veneto Banca SpA non siano da tenere in considerazione. Il relatore ha parlato di irregolarità e gravi errori sulla valutazione dei rischi di credito. In quest'Aula ho ascoltato profonde e motivate accuse che non voglio ripetere. Vorrei che norme chiare e precise individuassero le responsabilità e costringessero coloro che incorrono nelle gravi violazioni dei loro obblighi funzionali ad azioni di responsabilità e di risarcimento. Per gestire le componenti degli asset, che poi dovrebbero far parte di una bad bank tutta da prevedere al momento, si sarebbero potuti affittare o vendere rami di azienda delle banche venete a diversi soggetti del sistema bancario italiano. Così si sarebbero potute riqualificare alcune delle passività. Se quindi parliamo di crisi bancarie e salvataggi, che continueranno - statene certi - anche nei prossimi anni, e i cui costi saranno imposti a contribuenti e risparmiatori, è opportuno pensare di abolire il dogma dell'indipendenza della Banca centrale dal Governo, e cioè quello strano principio per cui Draghi può dire a noi cosa dobbiamo fare, ma noi non possiamo dirgli nulla se non riesce a fare quello che deve fare, e cioè tenere l'inflazione al 2 per cento. So che non volete ascoltare le mie ragioni sul sistema euro, e allora vi ricorderò come gli organi di stampa, le istituzioni europee, molti richiami di politici italiani che vogliono continuare ad alimentare la mala pianta dell'autorazzismo in Italia, continuino a dire che tutte le colpe delle crisi bancarie sono da addebitare a collusioni tra vertici delle società e politica locale. Vorrei quindi chiedervi come mai tutto lo stigma sociale, tutta la propaganda sugli italiani corrotti e malversatori da parte dei media e di molti parlamentari qui presenti colpisce solo la parte politica. Perché questo decreto-legge contiene norme per rendere molto difficile ottenere una sentenza contro i reati, i crimini dei consigli di amministrazione e dei vertici delle banche? Perché il settore privato deve restare impunito e si mantiene sempre ogni sospetto su quello amministrativo e politico pubblico? Forse perché il settore pubblico è ricattato e deve continuare a esserlo - proprio come tutti noi oggi dal Governo italiano con questo voto di fiducia - dal sistema antidemocratico dei Trattati europei, dalle indicazioni antidemocratiche della Commissione europea? Molti negheranno questo. E continueremo a salvare un sistema bancario colpito dai regolamenti dell'Unione europea, un sistema che non può salvarsi. E tutto questo, chiaramente, non salverà l'Italia; non salverà il suo popolo, ma lo ridurrà sempre più in schiavitù.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5090892910957336, 0.49091067910194397]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> RUVOLO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, il mio intervento sarà incentrato prevalentemente sul comparto agricolo. Non ho avuto, per ragioni personali, l'opportunità di intervenire nel dibattito durante la prima lettura. Lo faccio adesso anche perché vedo in Aula il vice ministro dell'agricoltura, che forse è un po' imbarazzato a stare tra i banchi del Governo e le dico perché. Quando il ministro dell'agricoltura Martina annunciò un provvedimento straordinario per l'agricoltura, ho avuto modo anche di complimentarmi con lui. Il Governo aveva addirittura usato l'espressione «campo libero», che in qualche modo richiamava la terra e che dava speranza. Ribadisco che mi ero complimentato. Purtroppo, però, di campo libero non ce n'è per nulla, e di agricoltura c'è proprio un dettaglio. Nella relazione che presenta il Governo al decreto, da cui voglio leggere alcune righe, si dice esattamente: «Non appare quindi più procrastinabile un intervento deciso del Governo in questo settore» - ovviamente è dell'agricoltura che si parla - «che potrebbe essere utilizzato come volano nazionale per una nuova crescita dell'intero sistema Paese». Di tutto questo non c'è nulla, solo annunci. Noi siamo stati abituati agli annunci, alle slide, a tutta una serie di comunicazioni ad effetto, ma nella concretezza, e soprattutto nel mondo dell'agricoltura, non c'è nulla. Se per un attimo i colleghi volessero leggere il testo originario del decreto, l'articolo 2 ha il titolo: «Disposizioni urgenti per il settore vitivinicolo», un settore importantissimo. Ho sentito in mille occasioni in quest'Aula parlare di vitivinicoltura, del suo rilancio e di cosa essa rappresenta. Ebbene, questo articolo, scritto solo ed esclusivamente da burocrati e che vi invito a leggere, dice in estrema sintesi che le richieste che vengono rivolte ai vari Ministeri, anziché essere fatte in carta bollata - e di questo vi siamo grati - si faranno in carta semplice. Se questo è il rilancio del settore vitivinicolo, ahimé! Per non parlare dell'intervento a sostegno del made in Italy. C'è veramente da inorridire se si può scrivere un testo come questo, senza che dica nulla nella sostanza, ma proprio nulla di nulla: un vuoto assoluto. Potrei parlare poi di altre questioni importanti. Non si capisce cosa c'entri, ad esempio, aver inserito (mi auguro che magari un intervento il vice Ministro lo faccia) all'articolo 4 (anzi all'ex articolo 4) il tema degli organismi geneticamente modificati, quando questa Assemblea lo scorso luglio, in uno dei primi provvedimenti approvati all'unanimità, diede mandato al Governo di allora di riorganizzare l'intera materia. In questo provvedimento invece è stato inserito, in maniera veramente molto strana, la questione degli OGM. Per non parlare, poi, delle agevolazioni che vengono conferite ai giovani che si attivano per fare impresa agricola. L'articolo, che chiamerei ex articolo 5, «Agevolazioni per il mondo agricolo giovanile», la cui gestione va all'INPS, dice che dopo che vengono esauriti i fondi e le richieste vengono avanzate, tutti coloro i quali sono fuori da quel gruppo, coloro che hanno presentato domanda un'ora prima o un'ora dopo, a prescindere dal contenuto dell'iniziativa che propongono, con una comunicazione (è scritto in questo articolo, vi prego di attenzionarlo) vengono esclusi automaticamente. Ma scusate, in quelle 20, 50 o 100 domande che vengono accolte, ve ne è qualcuna che va fuori? Significa forse che la graduatoria non scorrerà mai? Le poche risorse che sono state messe a disposizione vengono proprio abbandonate? Io rivolgo una richiesta al Governo e la prego, signor Presidente, di farsi interprete di quello che sto dicendo. Il decreto-legge in esame reca disposizioni urgenti per il settore agricolo, ma - guarda caso - non è arrivato in Commissione agricoltura. Io ritengo che a volte la forma è sostanza. So che ormai tutto è blindato e non vi è nulla da fare, ma chiediamo almeno la possibilità di confrontarci con il Governo, perché ci potrebbero essere e ci saranno occasioni per farlo, almeno me lo auguro, come ad esempio il disegno di legge n. 1328, che è fermo da un anno in Commissione agricoltura, ma potrebbe essere anche un'occasione per rilanciare davvero il settore agricolo. Quale modello di agricoltura immagina questo Governo? Prendere pezzi di qua e di la, fare questo e altro? Mi chiedo però se organicamente ha un modello al quale riferirsi per il comparto agricolo. Io credo di no. Signori del Governo, l'agricoltura ha bisogno di un credito agevolato immediato. La grande crisi di questi giorni sta interessando anche l'agricoltura come tanti altri settori, ma è più debole degli altri comparti. Occorre altresì una riduzione dei costi e soprattutto livellare i contributi previdenziali nella media europea, perché gli agricoltori pagano il più alto indice di quotazione per quanto riguarda la previdenza agricola. Ma quale competizione, quale competitività possiamo assicurare dopo quello che avviene anche in sede di Unione europea? Mi riferisco ad un accordo tra l'Unione europea e il Marocco che ha flagellato l'agricoltura mediterranea; praticamente, arrivano dall'area del Marocco (cui si aggiungono Algeria, Egitto e altri Paesi) prodotti che non hanno il minimo di tutela della salute del consumatore. Ribadisco in quest'Aula con forza che i trattamenti cosiddetti fitosanitari vengono ancora fatti con prodotti di classe A1, cioè veleno allo stato puro. Concludo, signor Presidente, annunciando il mio voto contrario, ma nella consapevolezza che il Governo possa prendere spunto dall'impegno che noi mettiamo, perché ci sia un'occasione vera e importante per parlare o comunque legiferare solo ed esclusivamente per il comparto agricolo. Non è possibile fare una cosa veramente orribile dal punto di vista procedurale, trattando nello stesso provvedimento sviluppo economico, ambiente, agricoltura (poi c'era anche la pubblica amministrazione). Ritengo che il Governo abbia il dovere di dare una risposta concreta al mondo dell'agricoltura.

Informazioni precise, ad esempio, sul numero di tamponi giornalieri che faremo nei prossimi giorni, fino alla fine della pandemia. Signor Ministro, siamo ancora ampiamente sotto il numero dei tamponi necessari; abbiamo a disposizione tecnologie nuove, grazie alle quali ne potremmo fare 500.000 o 600.000 al giorno (quelli che ci servirebbero); bisogna che ci dica quando saremo capaci di farli, visto che ne stiamo facendo ancora 200.000 al giorno. Quali sono i protocolli di cure domiciliari? Signor Ministro, a un anno dall'esplosione della pandemia, non sono ancora a disposizione dei medici di medicina generale e delle Regioni protocolli ministeriali di cura e trattamento dei vari stadi del Covid. Se ci sono - io non li conosco, ma ammetto di poter sbagliare - ce li mandi. Le assicuro che anche parecchi assessori regionali stanno chiedendo la disponibilità di questi protocolli. Quando arriveranno i vaccini, signor Ministro? Ha elargito affermazioni assolutamente apodittiche, che elencherò dopo, ma non per fare polemica. Abbiamo bisogno di sapere quando arriveranno i vaccini e quali saranno. Abbiamo appreso da lei di avere a che fare con varianti contagiose anche nella misura del 40 per cento in più rispetto al virus originario. È apparso oggi l'articolo di un esponente dell'OMS (di cui non ricordo il nome, ma che lei, signor Ministro, conosce perfettamente) che ci sollecita a procedere alla vaccinazione di massa. Abbiamo infatti bisogno di accelerare al massimo la campagna di vaccinazione per anticipare quella che verosimilmente potrà essere la sostituzione del virus originario con le varianti. Quando arriveranno quindi questi benedetti vaccini e quali azioni intende mettere in campo per arrivare a tale obiettivo? Quando sarà vaccinato il 70-80 per cento della popolazione? Abbiamo bisogno di un timing che, come le ha accennato la collega Garnero Santanchè, serve alle attività economiche e al Paese per capire come, dove e quando si potrà - forse - ripartire. È un problema tempo-dipendente come l'infarto: se non arriviamo il prima possibile, innumerevoli attività non si riprenderanno più. Occorre pertanto sapere quando potremo arrivare a vaccinare il 70-80 per cento della popolazione, in quanto serve alle nostre attività produttive e alla nostra programmazione economica. Infine, signor Ministro, abbiamo bisogno di sapere se intende mantenere Arcuri oppure no. Almeno questo deve dircelo. Ha citato un paio di volte la struttura commissariale e non ci può dire che non dipende da lei: forse non dipenderà solo da lei e magari dovrà concertarsi, ma ci dica se intende mantenere Arcuri a dirigere la struttura commissariale, perché ne abbiamo il terrore. Signor Ministro, mi consenta di dire un'altra cosa (come sempre, non c'è niente di personale). Ci è venuto a fare la conta dei morti degli altri, ma non è che, come si suol dire, mal comune mezzo gaudio, anche perché siamo in prima fila rispetto a questi parametri. Ci è venuto a raccontare ulteriori banalità (mi perdoni, signor Ministro): la luce in fondo al tunnel e l'esigenza di lavorare tutti nella stessa direzione sono argomenti che possono servire a «Porta a Porta» e in altre trasmissioni, ma non in una comunicazione al Parlamento. Il suo intervento di quaranta minuti si sarebbe potuto restringere a dieci, senza queste cose. Ci è venuto a dare asserzioni sul fatto che dobbiamo coprire gli anziani. Certo, benissimo: ma come? Quando? Dobbiamo coprire i soggetti esposti. Bene, ma come? Quando? Lei è un Ministro. È venuto in questa sede a declamare imperativi sempre categorici per gli altri, come l'esigenza di rispettare le misure di restrizione. Signor Ministro, certo che bisogna rispettarle, ma dopo un anno gli italiani non ne possono più, tanto che, per un effetto assolutamente fisiologico, queste misure di restrizione funzionano sempre meno e perdono di efficacia. Alla fine, la gente si organizza e si adopera, in quanto in qualche modo si deve uscire da questo loop mentale che comincia a coinvolgere anche l'equilibrio psicofisico dei nostri concittadini. Quindi, basta continuare a dire che dobbiamo stare tutti dalla stessa parte e dobbiamo tutti rispettare i nostri doveri; il primo che deve rispettare i suoi doveri è lei, Ministro. Gli italiani rispettano i loro doveri, eccome se li rispettano! Ministro, ha continuato a divulgare i soliti slogan, retorica vuota e spicciola: le polemiche disorientano i cittadini; l'Italia non si rassegna alla riduzione delle dosi. Oibò, direi io. Basta. Abbiamo bisogno di prendere coscienza. Ministro, lei si accredita e porta in dote al nuovo Governo dei risultati del suo Dicastero assolutamente fallimentari. Noi abbiamo il record mondiale dei decessi sul campione di 100.000 abitanti e siamo terzi per letalità del Covid-19 nel nostro territorio nazionale. Abbiamo il peggior risultato di abbattimento di <PARTY>L sul panorama europeo. Lei porta in dote al nuovo Governo il più grande fallimento della storia repubblicana, ma non per lei; è evidente che lei è punto collettore di una serie di responsabilità dell'Istituto superiore di sanità e del suo Ministero, che continua a mentire sul piano pandemico. Ancora oggi Urbani continua a mentire sul piano pandemico. Basta. Lei ha una responsabilità oggettiva che impone un'assunzione di responsabilità diversa. Pertanto, Ministro, ancora le portiamo rispetto, ma ci risparmi il 30-40 per cento di questo argomentare aulico del quale sinceramente vogliamo e possiamo fare facilmente a meno.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5338326692581177, 0.4661673307418823]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> <PARTY>AVONE (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori, il 10 ottobre del 1813 questo Paese salutava la nascita di un uomo nobile e austero, uno di quei profili che hanno affermato nel mondo il volto di un'Italia ricca di talento e di passione. Ciascuno di noi ha imparato a conoscere Verdi artista sin da quando, tra i banchi di scuola , i nostri maestri ci scaldavano il cuore invitandoci a imparare e a cantare la meravigliosa aria del «Va, pensiero». E con la memoria torno anche al profilo caratteriale che di lui a scuola ci tratteggiavano i nostri maestri, presentandoci questo grande compositore, uomo austero, financo burbero, poco incline ai complimenti e ostile alle celebrazioni. Un uomo che alle parole preferiva il silenzio, allorché riteneva che «tutte le esteriorità hanno qualche cosa di poco sentito». È allora con grande pudore e tanto rispetto per il Verdi uomo, oltre che grande compositore, che intervengo in quest'Aula oggi, perché, in ogni caso, non possiamo permettere che questo bicentenario della nascita passi inosservato per un artista che è unanimemente riconosciuto essere il compositore che più di tutti ha contribuito alla nascita e allo sviluppo del valore di identità nazionale, e di amore per la propria Patria. Le opere patriottiche di Verdi, dal «Nabucco» a «Ernani», da «La battaglia di Legnano» a «Le cinque giornate di Milano», costituiscono una vera colonna sonora del Risorgimento, ma la mia provenienza territoriale e il mio essere parte del popolo siciliano non può non farmi ricordare il dramma dove questo patriottismo si rivela più evidente e cioè quella magnifica e grande opera che è «I vespri siciliani»; talmente patriottica da essere allora censurata. Infatti, per la prima rappresentazione a Parigi nel 1855 venne cambiato il nome e mutato in quello di «Giovanna di Guzman», e con uno svolgimento con più in Sicilia ma in Portogallo. «I vespri siciliani» sono ambientati nella Sicilia del 1282, occupata dagli invasori di turno, gli angioini. Il tema principale dell'opera è la liberazione della Sicilia dall'oppressione. Mi piace ricordare oggi il dato storico di quel giorno: il 30 marzo 1282, allorché sul sagrato della Chiesa del Santo Spirito, dove la gente si stava radunando per assistere ai vespri, un francese di nome Drouet molestò una giovane sposa siciliana; il fatto provocò l'immediata reazione del marito e tutto questo mentre suonavano le campane dei vespri. In un attimo il tumulto si allarga a macchia d'olio per la città di Palermo e per l'isola intera, al grido di «moranu li francisi», gli oppressori soccombono alla rivolta. È un grande esempio nella della storia europea, perché avrebbe condotto di lì a poco alla dissoluzione dell'impero di Carlo I. Amor di Patria, dunque, che fa agire alcuni fuoriusciti siciliani, come Giovanni Da Procida, personaggio realmente esistito, che ritorna esule in Sicilia e a cui Verdi fa dire: «O Patria, o cara Patria, alfin ti veggo!». Un anelito di gratitudine mi pervade allora ricordando Verdi, che con queste espressioni stimola in noi l'impegno a coltivare la nostra identità di popolo, ad opporci alle vecchie e alle nuove oppressioni, ai nuovi invasori: la cattiva informazione, i luoghi comuni, lo smantellamento culturale, l'impoverimento crescente, e quella nuova emigrazione che oggi rende schiavi tanti giovani, e non solo i giovani, costretti a cercare altrove un orizzonte di futuro. Quindi, è con questi sentimenti che voglio ricordare oggi il «Cigno di Busseto», perché attraverso le sue opere tiene sempre libranti in noi le ali dorate della libertà, mentre riecheggia nel nostro cuore, mai sopito, un richiamo ad alzar «la fronte tanto oltraggiata» e a ripigliare il «primier splendor»\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5943093299865723, 0.40569067001342773]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, noi dichiariamo sin da ora la contrarietà all'articolo 2: lo abbiamo dichiarato anche in Commissione e lo abbiamo dichiarato in discussione generale. Ovviamente, lo dico ancora una volta rivolgendomi al Ministro, certamente non perché siamo favorevoli o sosteniamo l'assenteismo. Ci mancherebbe altro! L'assenteismo c'è; è un dato preoccupante, che va combattuto, ci mancherebbe altro. Ma il punto, signor Ministro, ancora una volta è l'approccio, il punto di vista che lei ha scelto per partire e declamare il rinnovamento della pubblica amministrazione. Non si può partire dai furbetti. Se si vuole parlare di pubblica amministrazione, se si vuole parlare di buone pratiche, signor Ministro, bisogna parlare e investire sulle persone oneste. Decidere di partire, come primo segnale di questo Governo, dai furbetti, vuol dire avere un punto di vista e una prospettiva, rispetto all'attività dei tre milioni di dipendenti della pubblica amministrazione, pregiudizialmente negativa. <p> L'antropologia che qui viene proposta è una antropologia negativa. Infatti, se io penso che tutti i dipendenti della pubblica amministrazione siano quasi tutti un po' disonesti (i cosiddetti furbetti, appunto), è chiaro che io produrrò una normativa coerente con questa visione. Noi pensiamo, invece, che la pubblica amministrazione (fatta da 3.200.000 persone) sia composta nella stagrandissima maggioranza di persone oneste. <p> Signor Ministro, io vengo dalla pubblica amministrazione. Sono un insegnante, ma sono stato anche preside e, quindi, conosco i furbetti; conosco, però, anche quel 99 per cento del personale del mio istituto (un istituto tecnico) fatto di persone oneste. E la mia azione di preside era orientata a sostenere le persone oneste, a far sì che potessero lavorare bene e, ovviamente, a combattere i furbetti. <p> La proposta dell'articolo 2, sostanzialmente, dice: benissimo, visto che questo mondo è fatto di furbetti, si introducono ulteriori controlli: videosorveglianza e verifica delle impronte. Signor Ministro, mi permetta di dirglielo: lei ha fatto un passaggio un po' azzardato, banalizzando le notazioni che il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali ci ha comunicato. Noi lo abbiamo audito, abbiamo la comunicazione del Garante dove ci dice che il principio di proporzionalità va garantito e che strumenti come questi vanno utilizzati quando proprio non si può fare altrimenti, perché la tutela della privacy è un valore costituzionale, un valore garantito dall'Unione europea e quindi l'attenzione al loro uso va tenuta in debita considerazione perché siamo ancora uno Stato di diritto, siamo ancora uno Stato fatto di cittadini, come dite voi, dove la tutela della mia privacy e la possibilità di essere libero va garantita. Le chiedo, Ministro, da chi verranno gestite le banche dati? L'articolo 1 del testo al nostro esame è molto attento e vi si dettaglia tutto: il nucleo della concretezza viene dettagliato e persino la norma secondaria è già scritta nell'articolo 1. Invece nell'articolo 2 non si dice tanto di più, non si dice cosa si farà, chi farà questa operazione, chi controllerà, dove verranno depositate le impronte, chi gestirà queste banche dati. Gradirei conoscere il suo pensiero e il suo parere. Infine, Ministro, abbiamo contezza dei costi? Vorrei sapere qualcosa anche a sull'investimento previsto su questo fronte dell'articolo 2, sempre per parlare del principio di realtà, Ministro, perché io gradirei che lei si mantenesse all'interno di tale principio che è un valore della politica. Noi siamo chiamati a misurarci sulla vita delle persone. Io posso sognare un mondo molto più felice di questo ma da legislatore devo dire cosa fare e deve essere qualcosa di sostenibile, qualcosa di realistico. Le domando, Ministro: 35 milioni per attivare questo sistema di controllo saranno sufficienti? È una battuta, una forma di ironia, oppure si obbligheranno le pubbliche amministrazioni e gli enti locali a dover spendere soldi e risorse per controlli biometrici? È questa la prospettiva? La invito ad una lettura che credo sia molto utile, Ministro. Un economista napoletano, Antonio Genovese (che forse lei conosce già), nel 1750 proponeva una prospettiva un po' diversa e diceva che se vogliamo fare bene a questo Paese piuttosto che colpire i viziosi, che comunque vanno colpiti, dovremmo provare ad investire sui virtuosi. È questa la prospettiva che noi abbiamo in qualche modo cavalcato e cercato di animare nella precedente legislatura, che viene smentita con questo disegno di legge.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5960654020309448, 0.4039345979690552]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, illustro brevemente l'ordine del giorno G9.400 perché rimanga a memoria del Governo, in relazione alla presentazione della futura delega fiscale, il tema delle compensazioni tra crediti commerciali e debiti verso le pubbliche amministrazioni. <p> Le compensazioni, al contrario di quanto si è detto finora, sono presenti in buona parte del provvedimento, ma la compensazione è, in realtà, la forma più rapida che consentirà di mantenere gli impegni che ci siamo assunti con l'adesione all'indirizzo europeo sui pagamenti a 30, massimo 60 giorni, delle imprese e che ci consentirà di non ritornare a costruire uno stock di debito rilevante come quello attuale.

È un'emergenza chiara e assolutamente evidente, che in questi anni - soprattutto negli ultimi due o tre - è stata affrontata attraverso una serie di provvedimenti d'urgenza che non hanno assolutamente risolto il problema. In modo particolare, nei precedenti otto mesi del Governo Letta, quello delle carceri è stato, non solo per quanto riguarda la giustizia in generale, ma anche per quanto riguarda l'azione di governo complessiva, il tema principale, senza tenere in considerazione il fatto che sicuramente le priorità del Paese sono altre. Purtroppo, l'attuale Esecutivo pare procedere nella stessa direzione. <p> È, appunto, questo l'ennesimo provvedimento, che noi definiamo asistematico, che viene portato ancora oggi all'attenzione del Parlamento per cercare di risolvere il tema del sovraffollamento carcerario. Ricordiamo in questi anni tutti i tentativi fatti, cominciando, già dal 2010, con la proposta dell' ex ministro della giustizia Alfano e il successivo decreto-legge n. 211 del 2011. Fu questo uno dei primi provvedimenti adottati e utilizzati per affrontare e risolvere il problema del sovraffollamento delle carceri, ma il problema non è stato ancora risolto. Anzi, oggi siamo in pendenza di una sentenza della Corte europea dei diritti dell'uomo che obbliga il nostro Paese, a pena di infrazione, ad abbassare il numero delle presenze in carcere entro il 28 maggio. Tutte le soluzioni adottate si sono incanalate all'interno di prospettive che non hanno affrontato in alcuna maniera sistematica né organica il problema del sovraffollamento delle carceri, problema che è stato approcciato con provvedimenti occasionali, cosiddetti provvedimenti tampone, che hanno fatto sì che esso persista e, anzi, si possa definire quasi incancrenito. Siamo convinti che prima o poi, purtroppo, questo Governo sarà costretto ad adottare provvedimenti clemenziali complessivi, ovvero l'amnistia o l'indulto, per poter affrontare il sovraffollamento delle carceri, e noi della Lega Nord siamo gli unici a continuare a ribadire che tale problema non lo si risolve con provvedimenti di natura emergenziale o d'urgenza, ma con un'azione strutturale ed organica, come abbiamo sempre proposto. Per quanto concerne in particolare il contenuto del disegno di legge in esame, siamo convinti che attualmente vi sia un certo abuso dell'utilizzo dell'istituto della carcerazione preventiva e che questo provvedimento dovrebbe portare a soluzioni ed accorgimenti tali per cui l'istituto della carcerazione preventiva non venga snaturato rispetto alla sua funzione. Sappiamo tutti bene che la carcerazione preventiva è un istituto che ha una funzione squisitamente cautelare, una funzione di tutela rispetto alla pericolosità sociale. Oggi però tale istituto è diventato a volte una anticipazione dell'espiazione della pena, e meriterebbe quindi l'adozione di alcuni accorgimenti, che in parte vengono anche presi. Ma riteniamo che il presupposto di questo provvedimento non risolverà nuovamente il problema del sovraffollamento delle carceri. Sappiamo che attualmente sono in carcere numerosi detenuti sottoposti alla carcerazione preventiva ancora in attesa del giudizio di primo grado, nonché quasi altrettanti che scontano sempre la carcerazione preventiva in seguito ad una condanna di secondo grado. Questo è un tema delicato, che merita una particolare attenzione. Se è vero che sicuramente vi è un abuso nell'utilizzo della carcerazione preventiva, in questa sede invitiamo tutti a fare attenzione affinché questo provvedimento non vada nella direzione di smantellare o snaturare l'istituto della custodia cautelare. Torniamo a ribadire gli stessi concetti che abbiamo illustrato nel corso dell'esame di tutti gli altri disegni di legge che abbiamo chiamato svuota carceri. Anche questo provvedimento, come tutti gli altri che lo hanno preceduto, va a modificare istituti di diritto penale e di procedura penale o a incidere su di essi, e in particolare sulla misura della pena. Tra questi, ricordiamo la normativa sulla sospensione della pena, sulla liberazione anticipata, sugli arresti domiciliari, sulla reclusione domiciliare, sulla messa alla prova, sulla depenalizzazione. Quello che non comprendiamo è perché si debba andare nella direzione di alterare il nostro ordinamento, destabilizzando il sistema generale al puro fine di risolvere un problema contingente qual è quello del sovraffollamento delle carceri. Non si può continuare a produrre normative su temi di urgenza o ritenuti tali. È evidente che questi provvedimenti rappresentano una visione sfilacciata rispetto alla finalità che si vuole perseguire per risolvere il problema. Quello del sovraffollamento è un problema che ovviamente esiste, ma che deve essere affrontato - come abbiamo detto prima - in modo organico e sistematico. Il Gruppo della Lega Nord continuerà ad insistere affinché questo Parlamento si occupi sì di giustizia, ma non solo sotto il profilo delle carceri, ma anche rispetto ad altri grandissimi e importantissimi temi. Attualmente affrontiamo il tema come se esistesse solo il problema dei detenuti. Siamo perfettamente consapevoli e assolutamente d'accordo che i carcerati debbano scontare la pena in carcere con dignità, ma dobbiamo anche ricordare che non è mai stata levata alcuna parola nei confronti delle vittime dei reati, nei confronti cioè delle persone che hanno subito i reati; non una parola nei confronti delle parti offese, che spesso vengono dimenticate e abbandonate. Non possiamo dimenticare - lo ribadiamo - che un sistema penale e un'amministrazione corretta della giustizia devono tenere conto non solo di una delle parti, cioè dei detenuti, ma devono rivolgersi anche a coloro che noi riteniamo essere la parte giusta: coloro che il reato l'hanno subito. Torniamo ancora a parlare di carceri: come abbiamo già detto, pare ormai farsi strada l'ipotesi di un indulto o di un'amnistia, ma questi provvedimenti clemenziali non possono essere la soluzione ad un grave problema come quello del sovraffollamento delle carceri, perché comporterebbero la nascita di ulteriori e difficili problemi che in questo momento l'Italia non può accettare. Come Gruppo della Lega Nord ci facciamo portatori delle grida che sentiamo levarsi dai cittadini italiani, dalle persone oneste e per bene, dalle vittime dei reati e da tutti coloro che sono costretti ad accettare questo tipo di provvedimenti, la cui ottica è sempre quella di assicurare benefici a favore di soggetti che comunque hanno compiuto un reato. Noi della Lega continuiamo a dire no a questo tipo di politica buonista: non solo quindi ai provvedimenti clemenziali, ma anche a questo provvedimento, cui posso fin d'ora anticipare quello che sarà il nostro voto. Non possiamo dimenticare - colgo l'occasione per ricordarlo - che dal 1942 ad oggi sono stati approvati circa 30-32 provvedimenti di amnistia o indulto. Questi atti, che non sono mai stati poi accompagnati da vere e proprie riforme della giustizia penale, non hanno prodotto i risultati che ci si aspettava. I problemi della giustizia italiana sono altri, e vorremmo fossero affrontati da quest'Aula, anche questi, in maniera organica e sistematica. Invitiamo il Governo e la maggioranza a ricordare che siamo in un Paese in cui vi sono 9 milioni di processi pendenti, di cui 5,5 milioni in materia civile e 3,5 in materia penale. Siamo quindi in un Paese dove, per arrivare a una sentenza di terzo grado, occorrono 3.000 giorni, se non di più, e siamo, secondo il « Doing Business», al 168° posto al mondo (anche dietro Paesi del Terzo mondo) per quanto riguarda il funzionamento e l'efficienza del sistema giustizia. Abbiamo approvato una riforma della geografia giudiziaria che sta creando disfunzioni in ogni angolo del Paese, disfunzioni che poi ricadono inevitabilmente sul funzionamento intero del sistema giustizia. Ma con un disagio per chi, soprattutto? Non solo per gli operatori del diritto, ma soprattutto per i cittadini che chiedono giustizia e la vogliono ottenere. Queste sono, secondo noi, le riforme rispetto alle quali un Governo dovrebbe impegnarsi: riforme ordinarie e importanti. Quindi, la nostra speranza è che il nuovo Governo, nella figura del Ministro della giustizia, abbia veramente la forza di fare le riforme che abbiamo indicato. Auspicando e sperando, potremmo soltanto dire: «Beati quelli che hanno sete di giustizia, perché saranno giustiziati».\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5072380900382996, 0.49276190996170044]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori, onorevole interrogante, intanto voglio dire che credo sia stato veramente un grave errore pensare che la pubblica amministrazione per anni potesse essere tagliata. <p> La pubblica amministrazione ha una pessima fama e forse, a livello di consenso elettorale, è facile tagliare, ma tagliare la pubblica amministrazione significa tagliare servizi, tagliare sicurezza, tagliare giustizia. <p> Questo Governo ha fatto una scelta assolutamente diversa, con un'inversione di rotta a 360 gradi. Dal 1° gennaio del 2019 il turnover è assicurato al 100 per cento. Quanto al personale delle Regioni e dei Comuni, voglio dire che sono state adottate specifiche misure che consentiranno di effettuare nuove assunzioni già in corso d'anno e in misura superiore al numero delle cessazioni e, quindi, saranno assunti più soggetti rispetto a quelli che cessano dal servizio. Segnalo, in particolare, l'articolo 33 del decreto-legge crescita, che è veramente importante, perché introduce una disciplina in materia di assunzioni che valorizza l'entità delle entrate e tiene conto del numero degli abitanti. Questa è una novità. Più specificamente, il numero delle assunzioni dipenderà non più esclusivamente dalle risorse disponibili per effetto dei pensionamenti, ma anche da altri parametri: dal numero degli abitanti, dall'entità delle ulteriori entrate della singola Regione o del singolo Comune e dal numero dei dipendenti in servizio. I Comuni e le Regioni che si troveranno sotto il limite di spesa del personale, che sarà indicato con due decreti del Ministro per la pubblica amministrazione, potranno effettuare assunzioni oltre il turnover. Quelli che supereranno detto limite di spesa dovranno procedere ad una riduzione della spesa per il personale, ma in modo graduale, secondo modalità che dovranno completarsi entro il 2025. Il procedimento di approvazione dei due decreti attuativi prevede ovviamente il coinvolgimento della Conferenza Stato-Regioni e della Conferenza Stato-città ed autonomie locali. Faccio presente che l'elaborazione di entrambi i provvedimenti è in fase molto avanzata e si sta incentrando, principalmente, sull'individuazione di criteri che, nel rispetto dei vincoli costituzionali e di quelli contenuti nella norma primaria, valorizzino in modo determinante - come dicevo prima - l'entità della popolazione residente (la cosiddetta fascia demografica). Credo che in questo modo finalmente avremo delle nuove assunzioni che permetteranno alle Regioni e ai Comuni di disporre di professionalità che, per numero, formazione e competenza, possano meglio rispondere alle esigenze della comunità e dei territori che notoriamente non sono omogenei.

Signora Presidente, signor vice Ministro, ho riflettuto se fare o no questa dichiarazione di voto, perché nel decreto‑legge in esame viene introdotta una norma che ritengo sbagliata e che può costituire un grave precedente per la cooperazione italiana. Se l' iter legislativo fosse partito dal Senato, quella norma probabilmente sarebbe stata ulteriormente ridimensionata, se non addirittura cassata. Quando si riduce il Senato a dire solo un «sì» o un «no», non solo si riduce la funzione legislativa, ma si rende la democrazia mediocre. Con altrettanta onestà intellettuale riconosco che l'impianto del decreto-legge, nei suoi vari titoli e con le modifiche importanti e le integrazioni altrettanto importanti avvenute in Commissione finanze alla Camera dei deputati - anche grazie al lavoro del vice ministro Morando, che ringrazio - è convincente e utile per il Paese. Non siamo un Gruppo guidato da un'ideologia, non siamo un Gruppo manicheo o un Gruppo che fa demagogia e quindi non riteniamo che la crisi abbia un solo responsabile. La crisi che ha attraversato il Paese ha genitori sparsi in tutti i settori dell'economia e delle istituzioni. Dunque, le banche non sono affatto esenti da critiche, ma rimangono per noi degli intermediari essenziali per il sostegno alla ripresa economica. Confidiamo quindi che la magistratura, la Banca d'Italia e gli organi statutari delle stesse banche perseguano, nel rispetto della legge, gli amministratori disonesti e quelli incapaci degli istituti di credito, alcuni anche importanti, in grave crisi o andati in default. Riconosciamo però che negli ultimi sette anni il sistema bancario italiano ha affrontato prima una crisi finanziaria, che veniva da Oltreoceano, poi una crisi dei debiti sovrani e infine una crisi dell'economia reale, senza scaricare i costi sui contribuenti italiani. Le misure pubbliche a supporto del settore finanziario sono state circa del 4 per cento del <PARTY>L per ciò che riguarda la media europea, dello 0,1 per cento in Italia e intorno all'8 per cento in Germania (per non parlare dell'Irlanda e della Grecia). I molti casi di insolvenza si sono tradotti nelle banche in un aumento considerevole dei crediti deteriorati, e poiché l'Italia ha bisogno di intermediari finanziari forti sul piano patrimoniale, capaci quindi di dare credito, cioè fiato, a imprese e famiglie, l'intervento del Governo diventa - ed è stato - importante e necessario. Come ha ricordato nella sua ragionata e convincente replica il vice ministro Morando, il decreto-legge si muove nella direzione giusta sia quando riforma il credito cooperativo sia quando costruisce un mercato delle sofferenze bancarie con la concessione delle garanzie dello Stato alle tranche senior delle cartolarizzazioni sia anche quando interviene in materia tributaria con il pacchetto fiscale. È stato detto che la riforma delle banche di credito cooperativo stronca l'unica presenza davvero localistica e partecipata nel mondo del credito bancario. Se così fosse, io per primo inviterei il Senato a votare contro il Governo. Ragioniamo: le BCC in Italia sono 360 e sono nate centotrenta anni fa. All'inizio del Novecento erano 2.600. Nel 1945, 835; nel 1961 erano 731. Poi una continua discesa, sino ad arrivare alle 360 e oltre di oggi. Le BCC attraversano tre secoli con tre riforme, compresa questa. Nascono per rispondere ai bisogni delle popolazioni rurali contro gli usurai. Nel 1937 si aprono al mondo artigianale e nel 1993 si aprono a tutte le categorie, con una pratica al dettaglio, facendo retail. Anche con le importanti riforme del 1937 e del 1993 si disse che le banche di credito cooperativo, allora casse rurali, sarebbero diventate un'altra cosa. Sarebbe finita in esse la democrazia economica e la partecipazione e sarebbero state spazzate via dalla competizione. Sarebbero state omologate alle altre banche. Eppure, mentre il numero delle BCC scende, con queste riforme si espande la presenza sul territorio, tanto da ricoprire 2.700 Comuni, e negli ultimi vent'anni i soci salgono in maniera esponenziale. Grazie alla coerente applicazione delle regole della buona cooperazione, la patrimonializzazione delle BCC è stata superiore al resto del sistema: più 20 per cento, pari a 20,5 miliardi di questi tempi. Ma le BCC, come le cooperative, non sono di un altro mondo. In un mercato in continua evoluzione e con una maggiore concorrenza, le cooperative devono sapersi modellare alle logiche del mercato. Il problema è che non perdano l'anima: senza vendere l'anima. In alcuni settori di tradizionale insediamento cooperativo, come l'agricoltura, il consumo e appunto il credito, è finito il tempo delle cooperative solitarie, delle cooperative atomistiche, non integrate in un gruppo o in un consorzio cooperativo o in una filiera cooperativa. La crisi economica prolungata espone le banche di credito cooperativo che fanno retail, e le espone di molto. I soci persone fisiche in passato si sono messi insieme per fare una cooperativa, per fare una BCC contro gli usurai. Oggi anche le cooperative si devono mettere insieme e fare cooperazione tra cooperative, per difendere i valori di democrazia economica, di partecipazione dal basso, di difesa dei più deboli nell'economia e, soprattutto, per svolgere fino in fondo la loro missione. E non lo pensiamo solo noi, ma anche il mondo del credito in Europa. In Germania, con l'unione tra DZ Bank e WGZ Bank; in Francia, con l'unione tra Crédit mutuel e Crédit agricole; in Spagna e nella stessa Olanda, che è stata il punto di riferimento con un gruppo già integrato intorno a Rabobank e che ancor più si integra oggi. Ci sono e ci saranno profondi cambiamenti nel credito cooperativo di tutto il mondo. Se le cooperative di credito italiano rimanessero così come sono, inizierebbe il declino e alcuni segnali, alcuni scricchiolii già oggi si avvertono. Dunque, la riforma che oggi votiamo favorirà la nascita di un gruppo bancario con una solida capogruppo, il cui capitale maggioritario è in mano alle BCC; un gruppo che si fonda sul protagonismo della singola banca di credito cooperativo, che rimane intestataria della licenza bancaria e dove rimane intatta la pratica della mutualità e della partecipazione cooperativa. A differenza di quanto avviene in Europa, è stata introdotta la gradazione dei poteri della capogruppo in relazione al grado di meritevolezza della singola BCC. I poteri della capogruppo saranno proporzionati alla rischiosità delle banche aderenti. Ecco perché questa è una grande riforma. Bisogna riconoscere alla Federcasse di essersi autoriformata, di avere proposto un progetto, e riconoscere che il Governo ha di fatto validato questa riforma. Dunque, alle preoccupazioni che con questo decreto-legge si imbocca la strada dell'omologazione forzata del credito cooperativo al gigantismo bancario la nostra risposta è no: questa è una vera, autentica, riforma democratica. Il Senato, quindi, scrive oggi una pagina storica, una pagina di rafforzamento, di crescita e di sviluppo del mondo delle banche di credito cooperativo, senza che queste banche perdano l'anima. Tuttavia, su questa pagina, signora Presidente, c'è una piccola macchia nera. Una macchia che la Camera ha tentato di ridurre, ma che c'è, è visibile ed è foriera di problemi. L'introduzione di una via d'uscita, la cosiddetta way out, risponde all'esigenza particolare - diciamocelo pure - di alcuni cooperatori da quartierino; rischia di inficiare il disegno strategico spezzettando il sistema; introduce un virus nella prassi e nei principi cooperativi. La way out non è un'invenzione di oggi. Voglio ricordare alla gran parte dei Gruppi che sono intervenuti in questo dibattito e che hanno criticato la way out, che sia nei Governi di centrodestra che in quelli di centrosinistra si è tentata proprio questa way out, ovvero quella che stiamo introducendo oggi in questa riforma. D'altronde, l'ideologo della way out di oggi è anche quello di ieri (d'altronde, i camaleonti cambiano i colori, ma non la testa). A chi dice che l a way out risponde al dettato costituzionale dell'articolo 41 della Costituzione, di rispettare, cioè, l'attività imprenditoriale, rispondo, però, che la medesima osservazione non è stata tenuta in considerazione quando si sono trasformate in modo coatto - anche con il mio voto convinto - le banche popolari in SpA. La way out genererà delle cooperative geneticamente modificate, degli OGM cooperativi, delle cooperative che si spogliano della loro missione e della loro storia e che il giorno dopo si metteranno alla ricerca - sempre con quegli stessi camaleonti - di un'uscita dal blocco delle riserve indivisibili e delle indisponibilità del patrimonio per trasformare i cooperatori in azionisti. Concludendo, pesa di più la macchia o il progetto? Pesa indubbiamente di più la costruzione di un progetto strutturale per la finanza del Paese e per le banche di credito cooperativo. Per questo dichiaro il voto favorevole alla conversione in legge del decreto-legge e alla fiducia al Governo.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5003264546394348, 0.4996735453605652]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> DE BIASI (<PARTY>).

Signora Presidente, oggi sono trascorsi venti anni dal tremendo terremoto che ha sconvolto nel 1997 l'asse appenninico centrale, tra le Marche e l'Umbria, con epicentro Colfiorito. Venti secondi sono pochi, ma sono interminabili quando svegliano una città nella notte; quando si vede tremare e crollare la casa e quando la gente si precipita fuori per paura di perdere la vita insieme ai beni e agli affetti più preziosi. Da allora, da quel 26 settembre, si sono susseguite varie scosse che sono durate mesi, di magnitudo 6.1 della scala Richter. C'è però da dire che la reazione dei cittadini e dei volontari fu encomiabile, come lo è sempre stata e lo è anche nell'ultimo terremoto che ancora oggi ci vede impegnati. Encomiabili sono anche il saper fare e il pragmatismo dei sindaci. E voglio ricordare in particolare tre sindaci che si sono occupati della ricostruzione nella mia città: il sindaco Castagnari, il sindaco Santini e il sindaco Sorci. A quei tempi, senza Facebook e con molti meno mezzi, si è riusciti a gestire l'emergenza in modo encomiabile. Voglio poi ricordare Giancarlo Sagramola, ai tempi responsabile della Protezione civile nella mia città. E parlo della mia città perché è quella che conosco meglio e di cui ho più elementi, nella quale si ebbe una sola persona deceduta, che oggi piangiamo. Mi riferisco alla signora Agnese Ciccacci, morta in modo assurdo per il rimbalzo di una pietra sulla testa a seguito del crollo di un cornicione. Fu quello un modello fantastico da prendere come esempio: il 70 per cento degli sfollati è rientrato in casa nel giro di tre anni; il 97 per cento degli edifici fu danneggiato, ma il 90 per cento delle persone evacuate nel 1997 è rientrato nelle proprie abitazioni. Il modello fu virtuoso: si costruirono dei consorzi e la riparazione e i progetti coinvolsero interi borghi e paesi; un modello virtuoso che non è stato però preso ad esperienza per il recente terremoto. E se in quella realtà, dopo soli tre mesi, c'erano le roulotte e i moduli abitativi, per cui tutti erano al coperto; e se, dopo tre anni, è stata conclusa la ricostruzione, per il terremoto ultimo, per il quale non abbiamo fatto tesoro dell'esperienza, viaggiamo ancora in alto mare.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6320444345474243, 0.3679555058479309]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> MATTEOLI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatori, desidero innanzitutto ringraziare tutte le forze politiche e i membri della Commissione per l'apporto costruttivo, il livello del dibattito e per i contributi che hanno offerto durante l'esame della riforma del codice degli appalti. E naturalmente ringrazio i relatori, senatori Esposito e Pagnoncelli, per il lavoro svolto e per la ricerca costante della sintesi. Un provvedimento che riveste un'importanza particolare nel contesto storico in cui esso si è portato all'attenzione delle Aule parlamentari. È opportuno, è giusto ringraziare le tante persone, le associazioni di categoria, gli esperti auditi in Commissione, i quali hanno offerto spunti di riflessione, proposte, idee di cui la Commissione ha tenuto conto e credo terrà conto durante tutto l' iter parlamentare, anche ovviamente nel passaggio alla Camera. Infatti, nonostante l'8ᵃ Commissione affrontasse la riforma del codice degli appalti con una legge delega, e quindi con margini di manovra limitati, i commissari si sono confrontati dando vita ad un dibattito, a mio avviso, di alto livello, cambiando sostanzialmente il testo del Governo. Ma tengo a precisare che ciò è avvenuto non contro il Governo, bensì confrontandosi con il Governo e alla sua presenza: non è stata una lotta tra Parlamento e Governo, ma con il Governo presente il testo è stato cambiato. Sul piano strettamente politico, il disegno di legge delega pervenuto presenta luci e ombre, come sempre accade. Molte ombre sono state cancellate da alcuni emendamenti presentati ed approvati, che certamente hanno consentito di migliorare il testo originario. Auspico adesso che l'Esecutivo valorizzi le luci e stemperi le ombre attraverso l'emanazione dei decreti delegati che, come è noto, dovranno essere sottoposti al doppio parere delle Commissioni parlamentari. Ciò rappresenta certamente per il Parlamento, pur nel rispetto del ruolo del Governo, un passaggio centrale, almeno politicamente. Un passaggio, mi auguro, che il Governo voglia tenere nella massima considerazione. D'altra parte, devo dare atto al vice ministro Nencini di aver seguito assiduamente tutti i lavori della Commissione, non in maniera passiva, ma - come dicevo prima - con un confronto continuo con i relatori e con tutti i membri della Commissione. Al dibattito hanno preso parte anche quei colleghi che hanno deciso di esprimere un voto non favorevole - come ho sentito dagli stessi interventi in dichiarazione di voto - per cui nel testo definitivo c'è anche il loro contributo. Credo che il pieno rispetto della delega sarà essenziale e su questo faremo le nostre ulteriori valutazioni di merito al momento opportuno. Quanto agli aspetti positivi contenuti nel provvedimento, fra essi sicuramente ci sono i limiti al ricorso al contraente generale, ma, soprattutto, la nomina del direttore dei lavori, che sarà scelto dalla stazione appaltante con il metodo del sorteggio tra gli iscritti ad un albo tenuto presso il Ministero delle infrastrutture. Si supera la norma precedente, che aveva determinato serie incongruenze ed aspre polemiche, probabilmente anche per l'uso anomalo registrato in varie occasioni e circostanze, con comportamenti a volte incongrui. Tra le ombre citerei, a mo' di esempio, il cosiddetto dibattito pubblico, mutuato dalla legislazione francese, che dovrà precedere la realizzazione delle opere pubbliche e non perché io sia contrario all'ascolto dell'opinione dei cittadini o, meglio, alla necessità della loro preventiva informazione sulla natura e sulle caratteristiche tecniche di un'opera, ma perché l' iter stabilito per la consultazione delle popolazioni interessate, a nostro parere, produrrà un allungamento oltre misura delle procedure realizzate, a tutto svantaggio della tempestività di realizzazione delle opere. Non possiamo del resto dimenticare che l'Italia ha una carenza infrastrutturale, un profondo ritardo che le impedisce di competere con efficacia con le altre democrazie evolute dell'Europa. È noto a tutti che, dal momento in cui un'opera viene pensata, fino poi alla sua realizzazione trascorrono tempi insopportabili. Un'altra ombra presente nel provvedimento è rappresentata dai criteri che dovranno sovrintendere all'aggregazione delle stazioni appaltanti. Il dibattito e il confronto ci sono stati, ma la soluzione appare incerta. È vero che esistono nel Paese un'infinità di enti e di organismi che possono dall'alto indire e gestire le gare di appalto e che si avverte la necessità di razionalizzare, diminuendo sensibilmente il numero delle stazioni appaltanti; è anche vero, però, che c'è il rischio di agire con la mannaia. Da questo punto di vista devo dare atto ai relatori del lavoro che hanno fatto e, soprattutto al senatore Esposito, che ha provato in tutti i modi ad intervenire su questo aspetto. In Commissione eravamo tutti d'accordo sulla necessità di ridurre il numero delle stazioni appaltanti, poi però, quando si è arrivati al confronto, è venuto fuori un provvedimento che, a mio avviso, da questo punto di vista è un po' incerto. Si è prevista l'introduzione di un apposito sistema di qualificazione delle stesse stazioni appaltanti gestito da ANAC, teso a valutare la capacità tecnica ed organizzativa, con la creazione presso ANAC di un albo nazionale delle componenti delle commissioni giudicatrici di appalti pubblici e contratti di concessione, con l'individuazione di una serie di meccanismi - vedi anche il sorteggio - atti a garantire pubblicità e trasparenza. Anche da questo punto di vista si rischia però di produrre danni e, soprattutto, ritardi. La mia preoccupazione - quella che ha segnato un po' tutta la storia della mia vita parlamentare - è di evitare ritardi, ma non mi sembra che né io, né coloro che la pensavano come me abbiano avuto fino ad oggi grandi successi da questo punto di vista. Mi sembra infine corretto sottolineare che, con il tempo assegnatole, la Commissione ha lavorato intensamente, tenendo conto che la materia trattata è molto complessa e complicata, ma anche delicatissima per gli innumerevoli risvolti che determina. Infine, il ruolo che la delega assegna all'ANAC è di grande responsabilità: razionalizzare le procedure di spesa attraverso l'applicazione di criteri di qualità ed efficienza e la professionalizzazione della stazione appaltante è sicuramente positivo, ma complessivamente il ruolo che la delega assegna all'ANAC è di grandissima importanza. Sono certo che, per come si è mosso fino ad ora il Presidente, possa svolgere questo ruolo nel migliore dei modi, nell'interesse di tutti noi. Le buone ragioni per giustificare il voto favorevole del Gruppo di Forza Italia, con l'auspicio che il Governo faccia buon uso della delega ricevuta, sono sicuramente superiori alle ombre, pertanto il Gruppo di Forza Italia esprimerà un voto favorevole. Tengo a sottolineare che nessuno - né i capigruppo, né i componenti, né tanto meno i relatori - ha mai pensato di dar vita ad un testo di parte: è un testo, questo, che non ha un colore politico, ma serve al Paese, pertanto il voto favorevole di un Gruppo che ha una cultura di Governo non può che essere questo. È ovvio e vale per tutti che, in ogni caso, saremo molto attenti e verificheremo nel dettaglio il contenuto dei decreti delegati.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5070649981498718, 0.4929350018501282]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> ALBERTI CASELLATI (<PARTY>).

Onorevoli colleghi, in questi anni, mentre il mondo del lavoro veniva stravolto progressivamente da contratti di lavoro sempre più precari e si sviluppavano forme di lavoro sottopagato o non pagato affatto, come ci ricorda Beppe Severgnini dicendo «L'Italia è una Repubblica fondata sullo stage », la politica si è ritratta permettendo che i nostri figli conoscessero solo precarietà e insicurezza, con contratti e contrattini che si ripetono, quando sono fortunati, per anni, senza una contribuzione adeguata né in termini di stipendio, né in termini previdenziali. Questa situazione è passata per troppo tempo sotto silenzio e, anche quando si è evidenziato, il problema non è mai stato nelle priorità. La politica era impegnata in altro, in discorsi retorici e roboanti, mentre il mondo del lavoro, come lo conoscevamo, con diritti che davamo per acquisiti, è divenuto sempre più fragile; si è spezzato, frantumato, polverizzato in contratti a progetto, contratti di collaborazione coordinata e continuativa, contratti occasionali, contratti a chiamata. Oggi abbiamo oltre quaranta forme contrattuali. Chi vuole lavorare deve muoversi in uno scenario in cui la rappresentanza, quella dei sindacati e quella della politica, è largamente insoddisfacente, limitata e di fatto, spesso disinteressata, ai destini reali delle persone che, nonostante tutto, nonostante queste condizioni, lavorano. Persino il diritto alla maternità è stato messo in forse: in questi anni di crisi, difatti, il lavoro delle donne ha tenuto solo per merito delle over cinquanta (a causa dell'aumento dell'età pensionabile), mentre il tasso di occupazione delle donne tra i quindici e i quarantanove anni, come ricorda il rapporto annuale ISTAT 2014, è sceso, lasciando così il nostro Paese inchiodato al 46,5 per cento (nel caso delle madri, ne lavora una su due nel Centro Nord, una su tre al Sud), contro il 66 per cento di Gran Bretagna e e il 60 per cento della Francia (che vantano, rispettivamente, un tasso di natalità di 1,9 e oltre due figli, mentre l'Italia è ferma ancora al suo triste 1,4). Scrivono Chiara Saraceno e Manuela Naldini in una documentata ricerca: «Chi svolge un lavoro a tempo determinato ha meno probabilità di avere figli nel futuro, mentre, tra chi ha figli, tra chi ha un'occupazione a termine aumentano le tensioni in famiglia». E questo si rispecchia perfettamente nel dato che, più di altri, ci deve far riflettere: l'aumento delle donne che non lavorano a due anni dal parto, cresciuto dal 18,4 per cento del 2005 al 22,3 per cento del 2013 (siamo andati indietro): il che significa che, oggi più di ieri, e quasi sempre a causa di contratti a termine e di lavoro precario, molte donne restano senza lavoro dopo la gravidanza. Però di questo non si parla, non se ne parla abbastanza, il dibattito è troppo spesso concentrato sullo scontro ideologico e aprioristico e si tralascia invece la realtà, le urgenze vere. La realtà, feroce nella sua evidenza, ci dice che una, anzi oramai diverse generazioni, quelle dei nostri figli, ma per alcuni di noi possiamo dire anche dei nipoti, non solo non hanno gli stessi diritti dei propri padri, ma spesso non hanno tutela alcuna. Questo disegno di legge delega ha il pregio di provare a mettere rimedio a tali ingiustizie, anche perché il nostro Paese ha bisogno, per ripartire e tornare a crescere, delle sue energie migliori. Al comma 7, lettera g), si parla di compensi orari minimi, stabilendo che sia introdotto un compenso orario minimo, applicabile ai rapporti di lavoro subordinato, nei settori non regolati dai contratti collettivi, previa consultazione delle parti sociali. Già con questo aspetto ci si rivolge a moltissime persone fino ad oggi invisibili e dimenticate da tutti. Troppe persone lavorano oggi senza possibilità di agganciarsi ai contratti collettivi e vengono pagate in base a contrattazioni private: possiamo immaginare quanto libere. Con le nuove norme queste persone avranno un minimo stabilito per legge, nel rispetto del dettato costituzionale di cui all'articolo 36, per cui il lavoratore ha diritto ad una retribuzione proporzionata alla quantità e qualità del suo lavoro e in ogni caso sufficiente ad assicurare a sé e alla famiglia un'esistenza libera e dignitosa. La riduzione delle forme contrattuali fa il pari con un'altra indicazione molto chiara, contenuta nell'articolo 1, comma 7, lettera b), in cui si enuncia la volontà di promuovere il contratto a tempo indeterminato come forma comune di contratto di lavoro, rendendolo più conveniente - non negando o vietando - rispetto agli altri tipi di contratto in termini di oneri. Molto semplicemente: alle imprese deve costare meno il lavoro stabile rispetto a quello precario. Sono delle indicazioni precise di attenzione verso una generazione che non riesce a mantenersi nonostante il lavoro, che lavora sotto mansionata o che non lavora affatto, e che solo con grande sacrificio e coraggio, nonostante il lavoro, decide di costruirsi una vita da adulto. Una generazione a cui dobbiamo finalmente delle risposte concrete. Allo stesso modo, va evidenziata la volontà di rivedere le forme degli ammortizzatori sociali, le nuove forme di tutela per coloro che il lavoro lo perdono si basano sulla necessità di garantire tutele reddituali con una rimodulazione dell'ASPI, con un'omogeneizzazione della disciplina rapportando la durata dei trattamenti alla pregressa storia contributiva del lavoratore; ma anche non lasciando solo il lavoratore nella ricerca del lavoro, tramite strumenti di sostegno e formazione e aiuto continuo, coinvolgendo anche attori diversi come scuole, operatori del terzo settore e privati in questo iter. Inoltre, sempre in questa delega, si parla di semplificazione delle procedure per le assunzioni, che oggi sono oscuri bizantinismi, e della creazione di procedure standardizzate per la concessione di cassa integrazione salariale. Certo, tutti sappiamo che le leggi da sole non creano lavoro. Siamo in un periodo di crisi economica che non sembra aver fine e che si ripercuote sull'occupazione, ma la decontribuzione per le nuove assunzioni, con una riduzione del costo del lavoro del 24 per cento del monte salario per le nuove assunzioni fatte con il contratto a tempo indeterminato a tutele crescenti dalla legge di stabilità, è un primo necessario e imprescindibile passo. Senza contare che questa misura si assomma alla riduzione dell'IRAP per le nuove assunzioni. Un passo che qualcuno, dopo tante parole e troppo pochi fatti, ha il coraggio di compiere e che noi sosterremo con piena convinzione oggi e in tutte le fasi attuative che faranno seguito a questa legge delega.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6694376468658447, 0.3305623531341553]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, colleghi senatori e senatrici, approda in Assemblea, migliorato dalla Commissione agricoltura del Senato, questo disegno di legge, che, come noto, ha la finalità di istituire un sistema nazionale di tutela e valorizzazione della biodiversità di interesse agricolo e alimentare. <p> Ringrazio la mia Commissione per il lavoro svolto e la relatrice Pignedoli per aver accolto le osservazioni contenute nel parere che, quale relatrice, ho redatto per conto della 12ᵃ Commissione e che hanno permesso di rendere la proposta di legge coerente con le finalità dichiarate nell'articolo 1. In particolare, per aver accolto il riferimento specifico, sia nel titolo sia nell'articolato, alla «biodiversità di interesse agricolo alimentare», che ha permesso di puntualizzare l'ambito di applicazione del provvedimento armonizzandolo con quanto previsto alla Convenzione sulla diversità biologica (CBD), e conseguentemente di aver accolto anche la puntualizzazione che si tratta di «risorse genetiche di interesse agrario e alimentare» e non, genericamente, di risorse genetiche. <p> Quindi, il disegno di legge, in primo luogo, è così conforme agli strumenti normativi internazionali di riferimento (Convenzione sulla diversità biologica di Rio de Janeiro e Trattato FAO sulle risorse fitogenetiche), entrambi ratificati dall'Italia, nonché agli strumenti di indirizzo nazionale esistenti, quali il Piano nazionale sulla biodiversità di interesse agricolo e le Linee guida nazionali per la conservazione in situ, on farm ed ex situ della biodiversità vegetale, animale e microbica di interesse agrario, emanate dal Ministro delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali nel luglio 2012. In secondo luogo, il disegno di legge permette di stabilire i princìpi per l'istituzione di un sistema nazionale di tutela e di valorizzazione della biodiversità di interesse agricolo e alimentare, finalizzato alla tutela delle risorse genetiche di interesse alimentare ed agrario locali dal rischio di estinzione e di erosione genetica. Dunque, gli aspetti tecnici relativi alle definizioni sono importanti, perché la biodiversità di interesse agricolo e alimentare è una parte della più ampia biodiversità di un Paese. Quindi, i due aspetti riportati nelle finalità coniugano coerenza e conformità della proposta di legge a livello sia internazionale che nazionale, dove l'esistenza di diverse situazioni regionali necessita di una messa a sistema a beneficio dell'intero Paese. Inoltre, la particolare attenzione che la proposta di legge rivolge alla difesa delle risorse genetiche di interesse alimentare ed agrario dal rischio di estinzione e di erosione genetica permette di tutelare e valorizzare situazioni locali che, troppo spesso, sono trascurate e, talvolta, minacciate dai grandi mercati, mentre sappiamo che i nostri agricoltori custodi, nel territorio rurale, svolgono un importante ruolo a favore dell'agricoltura e dell'alimentazione. Sottolineo l'importanza di aver incluso nel Comitato anche la presenza di un rappresentante del Ministero della salute, di aver individuato nella data del 20 maggio la Giornata della biodiversità di interesse agricolo e alimentare, distinta in tal modo dalla Giornata mondiale per la biodiversità del 22 maggio, scelta dall'ONU nell'ambito della CBD. Ringrazio, infine, di aver incrementato il Fondo per la tutela della biodiversità di interesse agricolo e alimentare come caldeggiato dalla Commissione igiene e sanità. Concludendo, si è cercato di facilitare la comprensione di aspetti tecnici che potevano rischiare di inficiare le finalità dichiarate e l'importanza di avere una legislazione nazionale che metta a sistema il Paese Italia sulla materia, attraverso l'istituzione di strumenti tecnici quale l'Anagrafe nazionale, il Portale e la revisione del comitato nazionale, che tengono conto degli indirizzi nazionali forniti in attuazione agli impegni internazionali sottoscritti dal nostro Paese e permettono di avvicinare - come è giusto - l'ambito locale e quello internazionale. e ciò avviene proprio nell'anno in cui, attraverso Expo, l'agricoltura italiana ha saputo presentarsi al mondo come settore ricco di peculiarità e di biodiversità e, soprattutto, attento alla sostenibilità ambientale, come - ad esempio - nel caso della tutela delle risorse genetiche di interesse alimentare ed agrario locali dal rischio di estinzione e di erosione genetica, introdotta da tale legge.

Signora Presidente, colleghi e colleghe, onorevole rappresentante del Governo, alla radice del cosiddetto voto di scambio vi è chiaramente un'azione corruttiva. Peraltro, incontriamo questa fattispecie già codificata come reato nel diritto romano, secondo quanto ci racconta Cicerone: l' ambitus era il reato di corruzione in sede elettorale, che colpiva comportamenti paragonabili al voto di scambio attuale e si collegava chiaramente all'ambizione del candidato che faceva di tutto per farsi eleggere. Proprio su questo tema Cicerone si fece promotore di una legge, la lex Tullia, che stabiliva in modo preciso la corretta modalità di svolgimento delle campagne elettorali. Questo per dire come fosse praticato anche nell'antichità un malcostume che oggi, soprattutto nel nostro Paese, dove maggiore è la presenza della criminalità organizzata (ma non solo), ha assunto la forma di un fenomeno che, per qualità e quantità, ha raggiunto proporzioni intollerabili. Tant'è che ai candidati alle elezioni politiche del 2013 era stato chiesto da «Riparte il futuro» - una campagna, com'è stato già detto da altri, sollecitata dalla società civile, da molte organizzazioni ed associazioni e da singoli cittadini - l'impegno a potenziare le disposizioni normative in vigore, al fine di contrastare lo scambio elettorale tra politici e mafiosi. Un impegno che tanti di noi hanno sottoscritto e che, una volta eletti, è stato mantenuto - anche di questo va dato atto alla politica - attraverso la presentazione di diversi disegni di legge sulla materia, tra i quali anche uno del Gruppo Per le Autonomie-PSI-MAIE. Abbiamo quindi subito dimostrato la nostra volontà non solo a cambiare una norma del codice penale incompleta e inadeguata, ma anche a mettere in atto uno strumento diretto a debellare un fenomeno che purtroppo è diventato un vero e proprio sistema per procurarsi voti a sostegno della propria candidatura; un sistema che trova terreno fertile nelle situazioni di disagio ambientale, di disoccupazione, di povertà, di ritardo sociale e culturale, di generale disinteresse per la politica (ma non solo, anche perché oggi sono altre le forme). Tralascio ovviamente tutte le considerazioni di carattere etico, che non spettano a noi legislatori o comunque sul ruolo della politica e dei partiti in senso lato, perché chiaramente su questo punto, a mio parere, ci deve essere un atto di responsabilità da parte delle forze politiche nel selezionare il personale politico che si candida. Per contrastare i legami politico-mafiosi l'articolo 416- ter del codice penale prevede l'applicazione della pena a chi ottiene la promessa di voti in cambio dell'erogazione di denaro, vale a dire che il reato si concretizza solo in presenza di un patto mafioso che preveda lo scambio di denaro in cambio di voti, negando alla radice la punibilità di un semplice accordo elettorale non avente ad oggetto tale scambio e privo quindi di qualsiasi esecuzione concreta. La realtà però è più complessa e l'offerta di denaro non è l'unica modalità - come abbiamo visto e come abbiamo detto nel corso della discussione generale - che il politico o chi in suo favore mette in atto nello scambio corruttivo. Favori, promesse di informazioni o di posti di lavoro, protezione dall'azione repressiva (ostacolando in diversi modi il lavoro delle Forze di polizia), informazioni sulle gare d'appalto o sui concorsi sono solo alcuni esempi di scambio elettorale, che però, non consistendo in scambio di denaro, non rientrano nella fattispecie di reato prevista che oggi andiamo effettivamente a modificare. Bene, il nostro Gruppo ha apprezzato molto il lavoro che si è svolto nella Commissione sul testo trasmesso dalla Camera ed ha voluto anche la discussione che si è svolta oggi in Aula. Questo lavoro, infatti, poteva essere ed è stato effettivamente migliorato; alla fine abbiamo un testo migliore rispetto a quello a suo tempo depositato e trasmesso dalla Camera. Infatti le modifiche apportate - come ha illustrato molto bene il relatore Buemi - riscrivono totalmente l'articolo 416- ter del codice penale, allargando la fattispecie criminosa e colmando così diverse lacune o, meglio, le mancanze dell'articolo originario. Con il nuovo testo sono state fatte rientrare tra le cause di punibilità non solo l'erogazione, ma anche la promessa di erogazione di denaro o di altre utilità; ma soprattutto - ed è di grande importanza innovativa - è stata introdotta nella norma, come previsione di reato, la pratica diffusissima dell'accettazione di voti in cambio della disponibilità a soddisfare gli interessi o le esigenze dell'associazione. Completa la norma inoltre un'altra innovazione importante, che prevede l'assoggettamento alla medesima pena, prevista da sette a dodici anni, non solo di chi accetta la promessa, ma anche di chi promette di procurare voti. Concludendo, voglio citare una frase che si può trovare sul sito di «Riparte il futuro»: « Rompere il patto corrotto tra organizzazioni criminali e politica è il primo indispensabile passo da compiere per ricostruire il patto sociale». Noi del Gruppo Per le Autonomie PSI-MAIE vogliamo concorrere alla ricostruzione di tale patto sociale, vogliamo contribuire fattivamente a far girare finalmente pagina al nostro Paese.

Esso prevede che lo straniero extracomunitario, in possesso di un regolare permesso di soggiorno rilasciato da un altro Stato dell\\'Unione europea, che si ferma in Italia oltre i tre mesi consentiti dalla legge, se non rispetta l\\'ordine di ritornare nello Stato membro, venga espulso forzatamente nello Stato di origine o provenienza e non nello Stato che ha rilasciato il permesso di soggiorno, come attualmente prevede la nostra legge. <p> Il rimpatrio forzato dello straniero verso lo Stato membro dell\\'Unione che ha rilasciato il titolo di soggiorno e non verso il Paese terzo di origine dell\\'interessato è possibile solo in caso di intese o accordi bilaterali di riammissione già in vigore prima del 13 gennaio 2009, ossia dalla vigenza della direttiva 2008/115/CE (la cosiddetta direttiva rimpatri). <p> Il recepimento è conseguente a una procedura di infrazione aperta in quanto l\\'Italia non avrebbe osservato le disposizioni in materia previste dalla direttiva rimpatri. Ci viene contestato il mancato recepimento nel testo unico immigrazione delle norme che consentano l\\'espulsione anche verso gli altri Paesi europei e non solo verso i Paesi di provenienza dell\\'immigrato. In assenza di accordi o intese bilaterali queste espulsioni verso l\\'Europa non si possono attuare. <p> Cioè l\\'Europa ci impone di recepire le proprie direttive, come se fosse una entità superiore, ma poi i Paesi, tra di loro, nonostante i tanti trattati dell\\'Unione, nonostante Schengen, devono trovare intese o accordi bilaterali. <p> Ci chiediamo di che Europa si stia parlando. <p> Abbiamo visto come la Francia abbia potuto, applicando e/o interpretando questa norma, negli ultimi mesi, respingere i migranti registrati in Italia e che intendevano varcare il confine francese a Ventimiglia. <p> La Francia è tra gli Stati membri con cui l\\'Italia ha concluso intese o accordi bilaterali di riammissione, a cui si aggiungono Austria, Bulgaria, Cipro, Croazia, Estonia, Grecia, Lettonia, Lituania, Malta, Polonia, Romania, Slovacchia, Slovenia, Spagna e Ungheria. <p> Noi, al contrario, ci dobbiamo tenere non solo gli stranieri che registriamo in Italia, ma anche quelli che entrano nel nostro Paese con permessi rilasciati dai consolati europei nelle loro terre di origine. <p> Allora ci chiediamo perché dobbiamo recepire norme che ci penalizzano sulle espulsioni e dobbiamo subire il \"ricatto\" dell\\'obbligo di tenere nel nostro Paese i richiedenti protezione internazionale che non possono allontanarsi dal Paese in cui hanno presentato la domanda di protezione, cioè in questo caso dall\\'Italia. <p> È una norma che contrasta con lo stato dei fatti e con il contenzioso che dovrebbe, al contrario, aprire l\\'Italia nei confronti dell\\'Unione europea. <p> Ancora una volta ci viene contestata una procedura di buon senso. Ancora una volta la miope o troppo burocratizzata Europa non si accorge di quali siano i territori di confine e quali i Paesi che subiscono la parte più imponente della immigrazione, conseguenza di guerre e occupazioni di alcuni Paesi del Nord Africa e del Medio Oriente, ma anche di un grosso e sporchissimo business sugli esseri umani messo in piedi dalle organizzazioni criminali. Ancora una volta l\\'Europa impone vincoli al nostro Paese, incurante del carico che sta portando il fenomeno migratorio in Italia in termini di costi economici, sociali e organizzativi. La cosa più singolare, però, è la schizofrenia con cui sta operando il Governo Renzi in materia di immigrazione. La legge europea diventata la legge 30 ottobre 2014, n. 161, recante disposizioni per l\\'adempimento degli obblighi derivanti dall\\'appartenenza dell\\'Italia all\\'Unione europea, reca disposizioni in materia di immigrazione e in particolare di recepimento della direttiva rimpatri. L\\'articolo 3, in particolare, interviene su diverse disposizioni in materia di espulsione dello straniero irregolare per adeguare le previsioni del Testo unico in materia di immigrazione alla sentenza della Corte di giustizia dell\\'Unione europea del 6 dicembre 2012, (cosiddetta caso Sagor), con cui è stata ravvisata l\\'incompatibilità di alcune disposizioni del testo unico in materia di immigrazione con la direttiva 2008/115/CE. Altre norme che riguardano i rimpatri sono considerate dall\\'Agenda europea delle migrazioni che pure è un atto comunitario ed è ancora all\\'esame della 1ᵃ Commissione del Senato. Ulteriori nome sono nello schema di decreto legislativo in materia di protezione internazionale, anche queste all\\'esame della 1ᵃ Commissione. Noi ci rendiamo conto che il disegno di legge in esame è stato presentato in base alle disposizioni di cui alla legge 24 dicembre 2012, n. 234, sulla partecipazione dell\\'Italia alla formazione e all\\'attuazione della normativa e delle politiche dell\\'Unione europea. Tale legge prevede, infatti, la presentazione annuale, da parte del Governo, insieme al disegno di legge di delegazione europea, di un disegno di legge europea, che contiene norme di diretta attuazione volte a garantire l\\'adeguamento dell\\'ordinamento nazionale all\\'ordinamento europeo, con particolare riguardo ai casi di non corretto recepimento della normativa europea. Così come ci rendiamo conto che in questa sede sono state inserite le disposizioni finalizzate a porre rimedio ai casi di non corretto recepimento della normativa dell\\'Unione europea nell\\'ordinamento nazionale che hanno dato luogo a procedure di pre-infrazione e di infrazione, laddove il Governo abbia riconosciuto la fondatezza dei rilievi mossi dalla Commissione europea. Ma ci rendiamo anche conto che, nella lettera di messa in mora, la Commissione europea ha contestato ulteriori addebiti, con riferimento alle carenze del sistema di monitoraggio efficace di rimpatri forzati, alla mancata predisposizione di dispositivi per l\\'allontanamento dei cittadini detenuti durante la pena detentiva e conseguente trattenimento di ex detenuti successivamente al rilascio, e di condizioni materiali di trattenimento degli immigrati. Ecco sono tutte questioni aperte che richiedono una organizzazione potentissima in merito alla accoglienza (i centri, sui quali si è pure si è alzata la luce della magistratura) e al monitoraggio, ma anche al riconoscimento, sulle quali, ferma restando la gestione italiana, anche l\\'Europa deve fare la sua parte. Quello che non capiamo è l\\'urgenza di recepire questa norma e quindi contestiamo sopratutto la sede e i tempi. PRESIDENTE. È iscritto a parlare il senatore Orellana.

Signor Presidente, la discussione che si è instaurata oggi ha una portata molto ampia e non riguarda solo il benessere degli animali dei circhi viaggianti e dei circhi equestri. Ha riguardato e riguarda - parlando della così tanto declamata civiltà - il benessere degli animali nella sua interezza, il che comprende anche gli animali allevati per la produzione di alimenti di origine animale. Il discorso, quindi, è molto più ampio, com'è d'altronde evidente. Anche sulla base delle mie conoscenze di carattere professionale, posso dire che è abbastanza improbabile che nei circhi equestri vi sia la possibilità che gli animali vivano in uno stato di benessere complessivo. Le modalità di spostamento, di allevamento e di custodia degli animali spesso e volentieri non sono sicuramente ottime, anzi vi è molto da migliorare. Però, tralasciando gli animali esotici, sui quali credo non vi sia discussione, perché sono assolutamente fuori dal loro mondo e quindi non devono essere portati nei circhi equestri, vorrei ricordare che per quanto riguarda, ad esempio, gli equini, nati e vissuti all'interno del circo, è evidente che bisogna porsi il problema del dopo. La chiusura nell'immediato degli spettacoli equestri all'interno dei circhi comporterebbe il fatto che siffatti animali verrebbero mandati al macello. <p> Questa mi pare una considerazione elementare. Tutti dicono che non è così, ma basta andare a vedere la fine che fanno i cavalli quando non corrono più nei galoppatoi: vengono mandati sistematicamente al macello. <p> La proposta è dunque duplice: da un lato, vi sono l'opportunità e la necessità di stabilire criteri e metodi di verifica per il benessere animale nel mondo del circo. In modo particolare, alcuni animali vengono tenuti bene, mentre altri vengono tenuti molto male, per cui devono esistere regole e controlli precisi. Dall'altro lato, occorre considerare gli animali che sono attualmente all'interno del circo equestre. Pertanto, l'ipotesi della gradualità nella scelta, logica e legittima, dell'allontanamento degli animali del circo è comprensibile, altrimenti non si fa l'interesse di quegli animali, che verrebbero condotti al macello. Occorre un minimo di miglioramento delle condizioni e una certa attenzione nell'erogazione dei finanziamenti, nel rispetto del benessere dell'animale; ma, dall'altro lato, credo che la gradualità sia la risposta più logica, nell'interesse sia degli animali, sia dei lavoratori all'interno del circo.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6750338673591614, 0.3249661326408386]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare. <p> ZAVOLI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, mi scusi se colgo questo breve spazio di tempo tra la sua introduzione e il mio discorso per intervenire con questo tono di voce che è un po\\' la conseguenza dello stordimento del discorso che lei ha voluto dedicarmi questa mattina rivolgendomi un elogio, che per un verso mi ha riempito di molte lusinghe, ma che ha costretto l\\'Aula, il Senato, il Parlamento a dedicarmi, grazie alla sua autorevolezza, dei complimenti e degli auguri che hanno toccato profondamente il mio cuore. Signor Presidente, onorevoli senatrici e senatori, dopo il complesso e penetrante intervento del Presidente, mi atterrò ovviamente a quel de minimis che accompagna ogni vita, e che da Emilio Colombo ho appreso direttamente anche in quest\\'Aula. La morte dell\\'ultimo costituente trasforma in una sorta di messaggio l\\'essere appartenuto fedelmente, e fino in fondo, «al vero, straordinario e immeritevole privilegio della mia vita», come mi disse proprio qui, seduto nel primo banco vicino all\\'entrata dell\\'emiciclo. Il giorno dell\\'ultimo discorso tenuto dal suo scranno per inaugurare, con l\\'elezione del vertice della Camera alta (quindi con un discorso rivolto direttamente a lei), questa legislatura, ci scambiammo le prime parole tratte da una confidenza che non aveva mai toccato argomenti e tonalità così personali: era visibilmente felice di avere ricevuto dall\\'Aula, quel giorno, un consenso unanime, manifestato con un lungo applauso. E fui certo, forse lo fummo un po\\' tutti, che quello, in cuor suo, era il congedo. Emilio Colombo resterà l\\'eminente figura di una politica cui partecipò nei molti incarichi e con le tante responsabilità della sua carriera, per dir così, lasciando autorevoli apprezzamenti sulla competenza e la dedizione spese nei ruoli più ardui, traendone un prestigio dovuto anche alla singolare durata di quella che, con una punta di civetteria, chiamava «la vita di una specie di leader, cui la politica aveva messo in mano gli attrezzi per non sfigurare». Negli annali, si può ben dire, della sua laboriosa appartenenza a quel mondo, ha vissuto una milizia lucida e coerente, testimoniata soprattutto nel sottile esercizio della politica estera, grazie alla disposizione più naturale del suo talento. Nato in una regione bellissima e nondimeno atavicamente avvezza alla realtà della privazione e della lontananza, in una civiltà contadina stretta tra le vigne e gli ulivi, amava ricordare un singolare sbocco al mare della Basilicata nel fondo di una lingua di terra inventata, si direbbe, dal bisogno di un varco mentale (fatto di quella trasparenza che lei, Presidente, ha richiamato più volte nella sua introduzione), un moto dell\\'animo che non tradisse le fedeltà solidali di Rocco Scotellaro, il poeta dell\\'uva e dei braccianti, né di Leonardo Sinisgalli, il poeta della «Civiltà delle macchine», e di Giandomenico Giagni, il terzo dei poeti lucani, al quale si deve l\\'invenzione del «Teatro dell\\'usignolo», una memorabile medaglia ancora sul petto del servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo. Nella casa quasi patrizia di Potenza, in cui ebbe l\\'amabilità d\\'intrattenermi, coltivò la sua vita in mezzo a quella sorta di oratorio civile cresciutogli intorno con naturalezza, come un signore che, avendo preso la strada per Roma, voleva dedicarla, così sentiva la gente, alla sua piccola patria. Aveva novantatré anni, come lei, signor Presidente, ha ricordato. Era senatore a vita. Fu Premier, più volte Ministro, Presidente del Parlamento europeo. Stimato nelle cancellerie, non solo del continente. Tenuto in onore dalla Chiesa; amico dei riformisti; laicamente degasperiano. C\\'era di che abbondare nell\\'idea che stringersi attorno a un concittadino con quei poteri, e di quel prestigio, giustificasse ad oltranza il credito dell\\'uomo politico più votato, in proporzione, d\\'Italia. Non era un moralista. Con una cospicua variante rispetto all\\'aforisma andreottiano amava dire che: «chi pensa il meglio sconfigge il peggio». Ma quando «Tv7» trasmise un servizio su un paesino della sua terra, di sole donne vestite tutte di nero perché i mariti erano emigrati - e volendo vivere in quel modo luttuoso, come fossero tante vedove, per segnalare la loro mite protesta -, allora il presidente Colombo telefonò in via Teulada per dirci, senza tante perifrasi, che a noi mancava la cognizione del tragico, in quel caso del patimento e della fierezza. Parlava con una punta di enfasi, che nel Meridione spesso significa non ingrandire una cosa, ma spiegarla, provando, non di rado, un\\'emozione. La Carta costituzionale è stata la sua prima fede e la sua ultima inquietudine. Sospinto da un umanesimo cristiano, mai, per la verità, esibito a garanzia del suo credo politico, gli piacevano, e usava, queste parole: «La Costituzione interpreta quel microcosmo che è ciascuno di noi, intorno al quale si dipana la rete di tutte le altre realtà sociali; in cui la libertà non viene declinata come un principio astratto, ma come una condizione umana essenziale e permanente»; é stato il suo ultimo richiamo a qualcosa che vale per ciascuno e per tutti, ma specialmente per chi temesse di vederla sottoposta a qualche indebito sconfinamento nella sua integrità. «Si fa politica non solo per costruire, anche per scongiurare qualcosa», diceva. Era una prova del suo malcelato ottimismo; quello di chi crede che anche a noi, cioè a tutti, spetta il compito - lo dice il salmista, ma spetta anche alla politica - di «far nuove tutte le cose». Lo ricordo, in casa, con la sorella Anna - che gli è stata amica, in qualche modo persino madre - in occasione del Premio Basilicata, la sua orgogliosa, ma non provinciale, predilezione civico-letteraria; e quando, in ragione del mio lavoro, tornai a interpellarlo per «La notte della Repubblica», mi fece un discorso sulla croce, cosi disse, toccata non solo ad Aldo Moro, ma anche alla democrazia italiana. Aveva vissuto quella tremenda esperienza con un\\'equità dolorosa e responsabile, attento alle sensibilità suscitate da una tragedia nazionale che richiedeva, dirà: «costi atroci in cui la \" ratio politica\" e la \"motivazione umana\" non hanno, l\\'una o l\\'altra, una precedenza designata rispetto alla grave questione dei diritti e dei doveri, in definitiva della prova estrema: quella di scegliere in un marasma della ragione e dell\\'animo». Era un idealista senza illusioni e un realista con molte speranze. Come per l\\'Europa, di cui predicava ed esigeva l\\'unità anche politica. Gli estremi accenti del suo febbrile invito a non turbare un inderogabile disegno, li ha spesi qui, proprio in quest\\'Aula. Ai vasti consensi tornatigli unanimemente intorno, dopo una breve, dolentissima pausa, rispose ancora una volta con la mente rivolta a una ponderata, parziale riforma del dettato costituzionale, non rinunciando a manifestare l\\'auspicio che quel necessario e razionale aggiornamento non ledesse, in nessuna parte, lo spirito della «Carta più ammirata nel mondo»; e ciò in nome di una ragione che smentisse l\\'inconciliabilità tra i civili, inviolabili principi, e l\\'obbligo, quando occorra, di pronunciarsi per un\\'istanza che comprenda, interpreti e unisca tutto il Paese. A ciò si è tenuto, esemplarmente, Emilio Colombo.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5204311013221741, 0.4795689284801483]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> FASIOLO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, ringrazio anzitutto il Sottosegretario delle informazioni. Non posso far altro che compiacermi per la diffusa risposta che si avvale, tra l'altro, anche del decreto-legge n. 13 del 2017, che lei ha illustrato e che fornisce risposte compiute alle esigenze degli immigrati. L'incremento c'è sempre nei nostri territori. Per quanto infatti non ci sia più una vera e propria rotta balcanica significativa, quotidianamente dall'area tarvisiana pervengono dal resto d'Europa dei flussi che sono piccoli, ma costanti; mediamente su Gorizia, dai 7 di ieri ai 14 di oggi; quotidianamente, una decina. Sicuramente pertanto la risposta che lei ha dato, l'offerta SPRAR, l'attenzione sempre più viva da parte dei Comuni allo SPRAR, all'accoglienza diffusa, è un aspetto fondamentale, che è stato peraltro richiamato anche dalle disposizioni urgenti di cui al citato decreto-legge n. 13. Questo è un elemento fondamentale e mi rammarico che alcuni Comuni - pochi in verità - abbiano negato l'accoglienza, soprattutto per motivazioni significative, per la mancanza reale di ambienti di ospitalità. Quanto poi ad altri aspetti, quali quello della progressiva eliminazione dei CARA, sarebbe davvero un segno di civiltà non averne assolutamente più. Ritengo altresì positiva l'attività che si sta svolgendo in alcuni Comuni del nostro territorio, i quali si rivolgono ai migranti affinché producano delle attività ad esempio di giardinaggio o di vario tipo in modo da poterne valorizzare le competenze. Questo dovrà essere un impegno anche per il prossimo futuro. Forse permangono ancora alcuni aspetti critici, ma di certo il quadro, che ormai si sta delineando, è volto ad affrontare questo problema considerandolo come una reale opportunità e non in una logica di tipo emergenziale. Una fase è finita e se ne sta aprendo un'altra: proprio per questo motivo voglio esprimere il più mio vivo apprezzamento. Allo stesso modo, esprimo l'auspicio che, laddove vi sia già la presenza di un centro di accoglienza per richiedenti asilo (CARA), come nella realtà di Gradisca, si cerchi di non dar vita a centri per il rimpatrio, perché c'è una sensibilità territoriale che - a mio avviso - va assolutamente rispettata. Il contrasto all'immigrazione illegale è l'altro grande impegno che ci si propone di perseguire attraverso il testo normativo, che convertiremo in legge. Ringrazio dunque nuovamente il rappresentante del Governo per la sua risposta esaustiva, apprezzando peraltro anche quanto è stato fatto dalla nostra Prefettura e dalla commissione territoriale, che opera senza limiti temporali e in maniera davvero straordinaria. È dunque importantissimo che anche le commissioni territoriali vengano rafforzate, viste le 250 unità di personale specializzato che ci si predispone ad impiegare e che dovranno costituire un'altra risorsa e un altro elemento di arricchimento.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5564838647842407, 0.4435161054134369]}, {'sequence': 'Ministro, oggi prendiamo atto del fallimento di questo Governo e dei vertici dell\\'INPS, soprattutto perché, quando si prende un impegno con il cittadino, deve essere mantenuto. Il presidente Conte ha dichiarato il 15 aprile che avrebbe pagato la cassa integrazione a tutti: questo non è avvenuto e non avverrà neanche nei prossimi giorni, né per la cassa integrazione in deroga, né per quella ordinaria. È un fallimento totale. È una vergogna. <p> DE VECCHIS (<PARTY>). Presidente, la verità fa male. Il 25 febbraio la Lega, in audizione con il Ministro in Commissione lavoro pubblico e privato, previdenza sociale, ha chiesto il potenziamento del sistema informatico dell\\'INPS, una richiesta caduta nel vuoto. Tutti erano consapevoli di quello che sarebbe accaduto, tranne questo Governo e il presidente Tridico. <p> Oggi avrete letto la bellissima intervista a Guglielmo Loy: un\\'accusa diretta a questo Presidente che ha centralizzato i poteri ed estromesso le sedi periferiche. Si tratta di un\\'accusa di un\\'estrema gravità, che merita le dimissioni del Presidente dell\\'INPS. Tridico, per vergogna, si dovrebbe dimettere e lo chiediamo con forza. <p> Purtroppo quella attuale è una maggioranza che sta un po\\' vacillando su alcuni argomenti. Vorrei ricordarvi che la democrazia non è la dittatura della maggioranza. Questa è una Repubblica democratica, non una Repubblica oligarchica. E siamo veramente preoccupati, soprattutto perché la nomina delle varie task force sta dimostrando il fallimento della vostra politica. E ci preoccupa soprattutto la task force economica. Vi consiglierei di leggere il libro «I conquistatori», di un senatore del <PARTY>, che parla delle banche d\\'affari, delle speculazioni, delle privatizzazioni. Conte ha detto che questo non è un Governo che lavora con l\\'aiuto delle tenebre. Questo è un Governo che - ahimè - diventerà la troika dell\\'armata delle tenebre! <p> Vi nomino il gruppo Bilderberg, Club Roma, Trilateral, quelli che voi state mettendo al Governo. <p> Vi ricordo che è la politica, il Parlamento a gestire l\\'economia e non l\\'economia a gestire il Parlamento, perché nell\\'economia molto spesso interessi privati cozzano - uso questo termine - con i diritti dei cittadini. Noi siamo veramente preoccupati perché voi state svendendo ulteriormente la Nazione alla UE e alla grande finanza; già con Prodi, con Ciampi e le privatizzazioni abbiamo visto che le oligarchie vogliono comandare sul popolo, perché per quei signori i lavoratori sono dei codici a barre e ora arriveranno come falchi sperando nel fallimento di tantissime aziende, che avverrà col calo del <PARTY>L del 9 per cento, per acquistarle a basso prezzo. <p> Magari tutti i lavoratori che perderanno il posto di lavoro potranno essere riassunti con contratti a ribasso. La Lega però difenderà il lavoratore italiano, perché il popolo italiano è fatto di lavoratori e non di schiavi della grande finanza che voi state tutelando e avete chiamato a ricoprire il vostro ruolo. Vittorio Colao sarà il nuovo presidente di questo Governo ombra: una vergogna mai vista! Avete abdicato al vostro compito e, quindi, a questo punto abdicate totalmente e dimettevi tutti. Lasciamo il compito a tutti quelli che verranno dalle banche. Facciamo una grande banca chiamata Governo italiano e facciamo prestiti a tutti. <p> Poi trovate pace sul MES: MES sì, MES no; Boccia dichiara che i comitati sul servizio sanitario fanno confusione; il ministro De Micheli dice che non c\\'è confusione; non abbiamo ancora capito qual è il mandato di questo comitato economico, se avrà il compito di gestire la politica. <p> Purtroppo, signori miei, la questione vi sfuggirà veramente di mano, perché avete una confusione mentale e ideologica che non porterà alcun risultato al popolo italiano. Oggi purtroppo non sono intervenuto durante l\\'informativa del ministro Bellanova, ma vorrei dire che, se per questo Governo è importante stabilizzare 600.000 immigrati dimenticando i disoccupati italiani, c\\'è un problema: non possiamo far lavorare nel mondo agricolo i disoccupati italiani invece di dar loro il reddito di cittadinanza? No, dobbiamo sempre pensare agli altri. Vi ricordo, colleghi e anche amici, che siamo senatori della Repubblica italiana e non di altri Stati: quindi dobbiamo tutelare i diritti degli italiani, dei lavoratori italiani e voi lo state dimenticando. <p> Vorrei anche fare anche un passaggio su Alitalia. Siamo contenti che stiamo lavorando sulla nazionalizzazione, ma non è chiaro quale sarà il perimetro della compagnia aerea: va chiarito se ci saranno esuberi e licenziamenti, perché non permetteremo alcun licenziamento. È facile parlare da una comoda poltrona e lo dico soprattutto agli amici 5 Stelle, che dovevano aprire il Parlamento come una scatola di tonno, ma a quanto pare adesso amano anche l\\'orata e il rombo con le patate. <p> Non è scappato nessuno: io sono qui e non mi muovo; questo è il nostro posto. Bisogna anche decidere da quale parte della barricata stare, se da una o dall\\'altra; a volte bisogna essere anche la barricata e la Lega è la barricata dei cittadini italiani onesti. <p> La Lega è questo: una barricata contro la speculazione, contro la grande finanza e soprattutto a difesa del lavoro, tanto è vero che in 11ᵃ Commissione abbiamo sempre chiesto - e non so quale fine abbia fatto tale richiesta - di istituire la Commissione parlamentare d\\'inchiesta sulla salute e la sicurezza dei lavoratori; tale Commissione non si è mai avviata, ma a questo punto è vitale perché bisogna difendere la salute dei lavoratori. <p> Sempre nella seduta dall\\'11ᵃ Commissione del 25 febbraio abbiamo chiesto i dispositivi di protezione individuale e noi abbiamo saputo che c\\'è stato un confronto con le parti sociali un mese dopo: sapete quanta gente si è contagiata in un mese sul posto di lavoro? Vi posso portare testimonianze di una categoria che molti dimenticano, quella degli addetti alle pulizie, coloro che disinfettano i luoghi dove lavorano gli altri. È una categoria importantissima, ma abbandonata a sé stessa. Nessuno ha i dispositivi: ci sono lavoratori di aziende all\\'aeroporto di Fiumicino che lavorano senza dispositivi di protezione individuale. Giuseppe Conte, dove sei? Stai vedendo film con i tuoi amici bancari? Non so dove sei. Sei in banca? Anzi no, forse stai comprando mascherine per 9.000 euro prima di servire i cittadini. È una vergogna, una vigliaccheria. Un uomo così non può essere il Premier degli italiani. Questo lo dico perché i generali muoiono davanti alle truppe, non si nascondono dietro le truppe. Bisogna cambiare mentalità, e bisogna farlo davvero. Senatore Lannutti, lei nel suo libro parla delle banche d\\'affari, della Goldman Sachs... PRESIDENTE. Si rivolga alla Presidenza, senatore De Vecchis. DE VECCHIS (<PARTY>). Oggi entrano a far parte del Governo giallo-rosso. Conoscete la Goldman Sachs? Sono quelli che hanno fatto le speculazioni e che non vedono l\\'ora di mangiare il cadavere Italia. Ma finché ci saranno la Lega, gli amici di <PARTY> e di Forza Italia, l\\'Italia non morirà, ma risorgerà; difenderemo questa Nazione. <p> Il primo grande carnefice dell\\'Italia è Romano Prodi. Lo ripeto: è Romani Prodi, che ha svenduto l\\'IRI e tutti i grandi asset. Non basterà la golden power per difendere le nostre aziende quotate in borsa. Bisognerà rivedere e capire soprattutto perché i Governi Letta e Renzi hanno privatizzato gli ultimi asset nazionali, hanno obbedito alla \"letterina\" ed hanno tolto i diritti dei cittadini previsti nel famoso articolo 18. Vi piace fare i comunisti col Rolex? Signori miei, oggi non è più il tempo del Rolex; oggi è il tempo di parlare di terzo settore. <p> Il terzo settore è abbandonato: in tutto il decreto-legge vi è un solo articolo che parla del terzo settore. Noi qualche appunto ve lo diamo. Magari è ora innanzitutto di tutelare gli uomini e le donne del terzo settore. È arrivato il momento di accelerare la liquidità del 5 per mille, magari anche sbloccando i fondi del 2018-2019 per i progetti a livello nazionale. Ma comprendo che parlare di banche è forse molto più facile e molto più semplificato che parlare di terzo settore, di uomini e donne che veramente stanno dimostrando che cos\\'è l\\'Italia. <p> Faccio alcuni nomi di cittadini: Danilo Guaiana, un sindacalista che pensa ad aiutare i propri colleghi; Orietta Mariotti della Pro Rett, che ha una bimba affetta da questa maledetta sindrome, ma la sua preoccupazione ad esempio è stata portare le uova di Pasqua alle altre bambine. Ricordo gli amici de Il cuore di Cristiano, una Onlus che combatte contro i tumori che - ahimè - colpiscono i bambini: anche loro si sono preoccupati di portare le uova, mentre qualcuno si preoccupava di riempire il proprio armadio di mascherine e protezioni individuali.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5202041864395142, 0.47979578375816345]}, {'sequence': 'Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, possiamo veramente prendere atto del fatto che siamo forse nel pieno di pagine fra le meno edificanti della storia politica del nostro Paese; ci dispiace per l\\'Italia e ci dispiace per gli italiani.

Le aziende e i cittadini non chiedono solo di essere supportati con meccanismi di sussistenza, ma chiedono di poter vedere oltre, di progettare, di prevedere, di costruire e anche di credere. Quali sono gli obiettivi di questo Governo, che probabilmente oggi verrà confermato, se non quello di sopravvivere a se stesso? <p> Quali sono le azioni qualificanti? Dobbiamo rassegnarci al fatto che forse l\\'unica vera azione condivisa appieno dal Governo è stata quella di mettere a processo Salvini; quella è stata l\\'unica ragione che vi ha tenuto in piedi. <p> E le tanto auspicate riforme sono diventate solo dei foglietti propagandistici senza contenuto. Le riforme vere, quelle istituzionali e costituzionali, sono state magari solo annunciate. Ma vedendo il metodo di lavoro, anche quello di questi giorni, e la debolezza della politica (dobbiamo prendere atto che vi è una debolezza della politica), forse è meglio che nemmeno le facciate. Alla fine cosa è accaduto? Forse si è reso solo effettivo il taglio dei parlamentari, che purtroppo oggi diventa una forte motivazione, per molti colleghi, per restare qui. Ma la debolezza e l\\'inadeguatezza della politica comporteranno effetti anche devastanti, perché nelle condizioni in cui si trova dovrà affrontare temi delicati, importanti e impattanti, come il tema del recovery fund. Ragioniamoci, sono fondi che sembrano imponenti, ma per raggiungere questi obiettivi occorre pianificazione, equilibro ed efficienza. E ricordate che questi fondi non sono una risorsa del Governo, non sono fondi per campagne elettorali, ma sono anche un peso e un onere che il nostro Paese dovrà affrontare in futuro. La politica non è un discorso da bar sport: occorre capacità, lungimiranza e visione; colleghi, non si governa improvvisando. Quest\\'anno di enorme difficoltà ha messo in luce una grande verità: chi è grande si è rivelato grande e chi è piccolo si è rivelato piccolo. <p> Oggi è evidente agli occhi dei nostri concittadini che non vi sono le condizioni per affrontare ancora la crisi sanitaria, la crisi economica e la crisi sociale. I cittadini vogliono in politica oggi capacità, progetti e strategie, e lo spettacolo che si è avuto in questi giorni sul palco di Palazzo Chigi non è forse degno degli italiani. La crisi di Governo esiste, non pensate di farla passare sotto traccia. Esiste perché non c\\'è una maggioranza politica, la vera maggioranza. <p> Se è pur vero che i voti sono individuali, un\\'azione di Governo si deve basare su progetti, che non possono essere fatti mediante patti con i singoli. I metodi usati oggi hanno visto mettere in campo le più vituperate e derise pratiche che qualche tempo fa i colleghi più rivoluzionari avevano indicato come il grande male della politica. Mi dispiace dirlo, ma agli occhi dei cittadini non vi è chiarezza in queste manovre e nei metodi. Si è sempre detto che non occorre solo il rispetto del diritto, ma anche l\\'apparenza del rispetto del diritto, e oggi, purtroppo, agli occhi dei cittadini l\\'apparenza è confusa. Ma che Stato avremo, che Nazione avremo se utilizziamo questi metodi? Qual è la dignità dello Stato e la dignità della politica? Oggi stiamo forse attraversando una delle più grandi crisi del sistema delle istituzioni. Il nostro Paese ha retto di fronte al terrorismo, agli anni di piombo, ha retto e combattuto la mafia, e sono i valori - quelli veri - della Nazione ad aver vinto. <p> Oggi abbiamo una crisi costituzionale ed istituzionale in atto che non è solo una crisi di Governo: è tutto il sistema che ha ravvisato delle crepe nelle mura che il primo terremoto ha fatto vacillare. Abbiamo cittadini confusi, rappresentanze inascoltate, politica alla ricerca di se stessa. Questa crisi della Repubblica possiamo vincerla solo con la dignità, la forza delle idee e la coerenza dei progetti.

Il mio dissenso comincia dal titolo, si alimenta dal testo e diventa totale sull\\'idea stessa di toccare la Costituzione. Per rispetto del mio partito non voterò contro, ma, nel rispetto dell\\'articolo 67, non posso votare a favore. D\\'altronde, c\\'è già troppo unanimismo: si propagano luoghi comuni che sembrano veri solo perché ripetuti con sicumera dall\\'inizio, trent\\'anni fa. Il mondo è cambiato, ma l\\'agenda è rimasta sempre la stessa. L\\'entusiasmo iniziale delle bicamerali si è tramutato in una vera ossessione a modificare le istituzioni, una malattia solo italiana, che non trova paragoni in nessun altro Paese occidentale. È difficile credere che la nostra Carta costituzionale sia tanto più difettosa delle altre da meritare questo accanimento terapeutico. È più probabile che il malanno dipenda dagli improbabili costituenti. Siamo chiamati a dichiarare che la revisione della Costituzione è oggi una suprema esigenza nazionale. Mi chiedo perché, per che cosa e in nome di chi. La domanda sul perché riguarda la decisione. Si ricorre all\\'ingegneria istituzionale per obbligare il politico a fare ciò che non gli riesce spontaneamente, ma questo cadornismo applicato all\\'ordinamento è sempre fallito: il bipolarismo doveva eliminare la corruzione; il federalismo doveva promuovere lo sviluppo locale; il maggioritario doveva garantire la stabilità. Per dirla con don Abbondio, chi non ha la volontà politica, non se la può dare con gli artifici istituzionali. Eppure questa illusione è dura a morire. Ha sostenuto strategie politiche, ha animato i talk show, ha creato perfino il nuovo ordine professionale degli ingegneri istituzionali, costituito dai parlamentari esperti del tema - ai quali va comunque la mia stima personale - dai giuristi, che ne hanno fatto una carriera accademica, e dagli editorialisti, che ne hanno fatto una fortuna mediatica. L\\'ordine degli ingegneri si pone solo domande tecniche, ma il dato saliente del trentennio è la crisi dei partiti. La causa politica dell\\'ingovernabilità è stata trasferita in capo alle istituzioni. Se non si decide, non è colpa mia, ma dello Stato che non funziona: questo è il motto del politico, a tutti i livelli. Lo sviamento, però, non è stato innocuo: è servito come alibi alla politica per non affrontare i suoi problemi, che si sono di molto aggravati. Le istituzioni sono state stravolte per finalità di parte, invece di essere curate nella loro essenza. La promessa era di riformare lo Stato per migliorare i partiti, ma sono peggiorati entrambi; mai erano giunti tanto in basso nella stima dei cittadini. È tempo di fare sobriamente la nostra parte, lasciando in pace le istituzioni. L\\'unica riforma veramente necessaria è cambiare i nostri partiti per renderli adeguati al compito di governo del Paese. La domanda sul che cosa si è ridotta ad un mantra: il mondo cambia e bisogna decidere in fretta. Ma in quest\\'Aula sappiamo bene che le leggi più brutte sono proprio quelle più frettolose: il \"porcellum\" fu approvato in poche settimane; le leggi ad personam di gran carriera; diversi decreti di Monti, approvati con lo squillar di trombe, sono oggi smontati dal Governo Letta. Il decisionismo senza idee ha prodotto un\\'alluvione normativa che soffoca l\\'economia e la vita quotidiana dei cittadini. Ce la prendiamo con la burocrazia come se fosse un destino cinico e baro, ma invece essa dipende dalle troppe leggi che approviamo qui. Aveva ragione Luigi Einaudi a fare l\\'elogio della lentezza parlamentare come antidoto all\\'ipertrofia normativa. Non è la velocità ma la qualità che manca al procedimento legislativo. La causa è nello strapotere dei Governi che da tanti anni propongono solo leggi omnibus, con centinaia di commi disorganici, improvvisati, spesso modificati prima di essere applicati. Questa peste normativa distrugge l\\'amministrazione dello Stato, crea i contenziosi, le interpretazioni fantasiose e la paralisi attuativa. Bisognerebbe restituire al Parlamento la piena sovranità legislativa, ma questa autoriforma dovremmo farla noi, cari colleghi, senza delegarla all\\'ordine professionale degli ingegneri istituzionali, dovremmo attuarla con l\\'orgoglio di parlamentari: poche leggi l\\'anno, in forma di codici unitari, delegando funzioni al Governo e aumentando i poteri di controllo. Stabilire che non si legiferi senza prima valutare i risultati delle leggi precedenti. Dare alle Commissioni parlamentari poteri di inchiesta: un dirigente di Finmeccanica deve temere un\\'audizione come un manager americano quando va in Senato. Alla terza domanda (in nome di chi?) si risponde: nell\\'interesse nazionale. Eppure, ogni volta che abbiamo modificato la Costituzione ce ne siamo dovuti pentire: il Titolo V ha creato conflitti permanenti tra Stato e Regioni; dopo lo ius sanguinis del voto all\\'estero oggi si passa ad invocare lo ius soli per i figli degli immigrati; prima si blocca il pareggio di bilancio e poi si esulta per la deroga concessa dall\\'Europa. D\\'altro canto, basta leggere il testo per notare la differenza. La bella lingua italiana, con le parole semplici e intense dei Padri costituenti, viene improvvisamente interrotta da un lessico nevrotico e tecnicistico, scandito dai rinvii a commi, come un regolamento di condominio. Sono queste le parti aggiunte da noi. Fortunatamente i cittadini hanno evitato i guai peggiori bocciando la legge costituzionale ideata dagli stessi autori del \"porcellum\". L\\'unico baluardo è venuto dai presidenti di garanzia come Scalfaro, Ciampi e Napolitano. Mi sconcerta la leggerezza con la quale si ritiene possibile demolire questo ultimo bastione. In Italia la personalizzazione si è sempre presentata come patologia e non come responsabilità delle leadership. Non scherziamo col fuoco: il presidenzialismo non sarebbe un emendamento, ma un\\'altra Costituzione. Dovremmo avere un senso del limite. I nostri partiti rappresentano oggi a malapena la metà del corpo elettorale, l\\'altra metà ha manifestato in tutti i modi il disagio e la sfiducia. Noi non siamo quindi in grado, in questo momento, di rappresentare l\\'unità nazionale. Non è saggio usare la revisione costituzionale per santificare un Governo privo del mandato elettorale. Questo è il vulnus che segna la modifica dell\\'articolo 138 della Costituzione. Il procedimento lega la sorte del Governo ai tempi e ai modi della revisione costituzionale. Porre un vincolo di maggioranza come inizio e come fine nella della riforma è una forzatura politico-costituzionale senza precedenti in Italia e in Europa. I Governi passano, le Costituzioni rimangono, non dimentichiamolo. Dovremmo prendere atto che la nostra generazione non è capace di fare queste riforme, che possa farlo oggi al minimo storico del consenso elettorale è un ardimento senza responsabilità, è una dismisura contro lo spirito costituzionale. Lasciamo alle generazioni successive il compito di rielaborare l\\'eredità ricevuta dai Padri costituenti. Non tutte le generazioni hanno l\\'autorevolezza per cambiare la Costituzione. Dovremmo prenderne atto con umiltà, con l\\'umiltà di cui parla Papa Francesco, che dovrebbe sempre accompagnare l\\'esercizio del potere. La nostra umiltà è il migliore contributo che possiamo portare oggi alla Carta costituzionale.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5356274247169495, 0.4643726348876953]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> CALIGIURI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, ritorna, con mio grande piacere, per la seconda volta in questa settimana al centro dell'attenzione e del dibattito il settore agricolo e il modo in cui questo possa svilupparsi sempre più e diventare maggiormente competitivo all'interno del mercato globale. Che cos'è il biologico? È in primis un metodo di produzione secondo un modello di sviluppo rurale e tutela ambientale e della salute. Il metodo biologico, infatti, è sempre più centrale anche alla luce della nuova politica agricola comune, che pone come punto nevralgico il rispetto dell'ambiente e della sua sostenibilità. È stato ricordato dai colleghi che nel 2019 l'Italia si è confermata primo Paese europeo per numero di aziende agricole impegnate nel biologico, con oltre 80.000 operatori coinvolti, con ben due milioni di ettari di superficie coltivata che rappresentano il 16 per cento della superficie agricola utilizzata. Il reddito netto delle aziende bio rispetto a quelle convenzionali fa registrare un incremento del 15 per cento, con il 31 per cento dei lavoratori in più. La lungimiranza dei nostri agricoltori è stata premiata da consumi da record, con introiti pari a tre miliardi e questo senza tenere conto del comparto Horeca. Il bio costa di più ai consumatori perché - sia chiaro - costa di più al produttore agricolo, inoltre il disciplinare del bio - ricordiamolo - ha dei paletti molto stringenti entro i quali si dovranno muovere tutte le altre metodologie e produzioni, ad esempio quella della biodinamica. È necessario, però, uno sforzo maggiore, bisogna infatti anche segnalare l'incremento delle importazioni di prodotti biologici da Paesi extracomunitari, pari al più 13 per cento. Dovremmo quindi cercare di ridurre la nostra dipendenza e sostenere le produzioni di materia prima italiana certificata, garantendo al consumatore la qualità del prodotto e puntando così al raggiungimento di un obiettivo fondamentale della strategia farm to fork : il 25 per cento di superficie coltivata con metodo biologico. La questione delle materie prime oggi in particolare è il punto nodale del discorso, incidendo su ogni comparto economico-produttivo e di consumo. Assistiamo ad un incremento smisurato del costo delle materie prime, del trasporto, dei container, che finisce per incidere sull'aumento dei costi generali, creando serie difficoltà. Bisogna quindi lavorare per ridurre l'impatto di ciò sul sistema. Per farlo bisogna stanziare, ad esempio, le risorse necessarie anche ai nostri agricoltori, tramite il fondo per lo sviluppo della produzione biologica di cui all'articolo 9 del disegno di legge che stiamo discutendo. Riguardo al sostegno pubblico e al comparto agricolo ciò risulta oggi più che mai vitale, visto il periodo di estrema criticità che lo stesso vive. Già prima del Covid, che ha visto la riduzione della manodopera, mettendo a rischio i raccolti, il comparto ha dovuto fronteggiare una serie di eventi: calamità naturali, diffusione di patogeni batterici, frutto anche dei cambiamenti climatici, come la xylella fastidiosa, tanto per citarne uno, che hanno prodotto danni ingenti. Tutto ciò ha costretto gli operatori, che non hanno mai interrotto la loro attività, anche a contrarre nuovi prestiti per poter garantire il prosieguo delle produzioni. Chiediamo quindi un ulteriore sforzo al Governo, oltre a quelli già effettuati - e lo faccio per il tramite del nostro sottosegretario Battistoni, che ringrazio per l'impegno e la sensibilità nei confronti del comparto dimostrati costantemente - al fine di garantire ad esempio un aiuto concreto agli imprenditori per l'accesso al credito, ad esempio rifinanziando la cambiale agraria che si è confermato un valido strumento di liquidità per le imprese del settore, soprattutto a fronte del periodo di emergenza vissuta. Suggerisco anche lo snellimento delle procedure che per via della loro complessità scoraggiano molti, come un aiuto per l'accesso alle garanzie necessarie per ottenere i finanziamenti. All'interno del disegno di legge n. 988 troviamo dei riferimenti e dei rimandi che sono la sintesi perfetta di ciò che serve al comparto agricolo in generale: rafforzamento filiera, marchio biologico unico, favorire i contratti di rete, distretti biologici, monitoraggio del settore, tracciabilità. Credo sia abbastanza chiara l'importanza di ciascuna delle suddette argomentazioni. Alla Camera dei deputati il Gruppo Forza Italia aveva espresso un voto contrario sul disegno di legge al nostro esame non perché contrario al metodo biologico che, come ho precedentemente affermato, è fondamentale per lo sviluppo della filiera, ma bensì perché il provvedimento si presentava incompleto. Mancava una parte fondamentale e imprescindibile per Forza Italia, il tema dei controlli, che non veniva in alcun modo affrontato e, così facendo, si sarebbe fatto un danno proprio al biologico. Permettetemi un ringraziamento al relatore, senatore Taricco, e a tutti i colleghi della 9ᵃ Commissione per il lavoro svolto in assoluta armonia e rispetto perché è proprio sui controlli che in Commissione si è svolto un ruolo importante con l'introduzione dell'articolo 19, che delega al Governo la revisione, l'armonizzazione e la razionalizzazione della normativa sui controlli. In conclusione, investire nel biologico è un approccio win-win, vincono le attività agricole e le attività economiche, ma vinciamo anche tutti noi, vedendo l'adozione di migliori prassi, meno impattanti da un punto di vista ambientale, per una maggiore salvaguardia delle risorse naturali. Da parte nostra però impegniamoci a tutelare il comparto, non dimenticando che l'agricoltore è anche il custode delle terre, le quali producono prodotti sani e di qualità, che tutto il mondo ci invidia. Facciamolo controllando l'operato delle aziende per tutelare chi rispetta le regole, finanziandone le attività. Alla luce dell'introduzione della normativa sui controlli, nonché del miglioramento del testo, annuncio il voto favorevole di Forza Italia.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6351577639579773, 0.3648422062397003]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> BRUNI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, signor Ministro, onorevoli colleghi, il decreto-legge sottoposto al nostro esame dimostra ancora una volta che un presupposto irrinunciabile per affrontare le questioni e le querelle ambientali è quello della conoscenza. Infatti una buona parte delle norme introdotte si incentra sulla conoscenza dello stato dei territori e dello stato di salute della popolazione. Significativo in tal senso mi sembra quanto disposto dall'articolo 1, ove si prevede che i terreni della Regione Campania destinati all'agricoltura siano sottoposti a mappatura, onde poter sapere quanti di essi siano effettivamente suscettibili di utilizzazione per produzioni agroalimentari e quali destinati ad altre colture. Tale obiettivo, una volta raggiunto, consentirà finalmente di avere un quadro di conoscenza da offrire a tutte le amministrazioni interessate e quindi di orientare le loro scelte alla luce di dati scientifici certi. Se ci pensate, fino ad oggi i vari rilievi, le diverse mappature di cui si è parlato nel dibattito di oggi in Aula sono stati episodici, frammentari e certamente disorganici. Molto spesso gli unici dati di riferimento utilizzati dalle amministrazioni locali sono stati quelli rinvenibili nelle diverse indagini penali stratificate negli ultimi decenni in Campania, e ciò non ha consentito di tutelare al meglio la popolazione e le stesse imprese impegnate nelle produzioni agroalimentari; anzi, il fatto stesso che una grande mole di dati sia stata rilevata nei fascicoli penali ha creato le condizioni per l'insorgenza di un allarmismo crescente e diffuso. Ne è conseguita una forte divisione sulle scelte operate o programmate dalle amministrazioni statali e locali interessate, cui non sempre l'opinione pubblica ha dato il proprio assenso. Proprio per ribaltare ed ovviare a questo quadro di incertezze è quindi necessaria l'attività di mappatura dei terreni prevista dal provvedimento in votazione. All'esito di detta attività saremo in grado di avere maggiori certezze sui terreni che possono essere utilizzati e su quelli che devono essere bonificati. Per i medesimi motivi, non si può non concordare sulla necessità di più completi ed aggiornati studi epidemiologici. Anche questa esigenza rientra in quel bisogno di conoscenza che è il filo conduttore del decreto. Il provvedimento, infatti, stabilisce la pubblicazione dei dati del progetto SENTIERI, per esempio nel caso di Taranto, prevedendo, inoltre, un'ulteriore implementazione dello stesso. La ratio di tale norma è certamente condivisibile: va nella direzione di realizzare effettivamente il principio della tutela del diritto alla salute costituzionalmente garantito. È meno condivisibile, però, che il legislatore fissi nel progetto SENTIERI il metodo ed il mezzo per avere uno studio epidemiologico relativo ai travagliati territori di Taranto e del suo hinterland. Molta parte del mondo scientifico, infatti, ritiene che per giungere ad individuare il nesso di causalità tra l'impianto o il fattore inquinante e le conseguenze sulla salute della popolazione non si possa utilizzare un metodo di epidemiologia classica come quello applicato nel progetto SENTIERI. L'utilizzazione ulteriore di tale metodo costringerà ancora le autorità locali a doversi avvalere del solo principio di precauzione al fine di tutelare al meglio la salute dei cittadini. Invece, sarebbe più opportuno ricorrere a modelli più moderni, quali, ad esempio, l'epidemiologia molecolare, con l'utilizzazione di biomarcatori di esposizione che consentano di poter accertare, ove sussistente, il nesso eziologico tra inquinamento e danno alla salute con maggiori certezze scientifiche. In ogni caso, è certamente positivo che nel decreto si rilevi l'esigenza del potenziamento degli studi epidemiologici, poiché ciò accresce quel quadro di conoscenze che consente a tutti i decisori (cioè alle diverse amministrazioni) di poter effettuare le scelte più opportune, evitando provvedimenti a macchia di leopardo o realizzati a valle dei sequestri penali. Certamente utile può essere anche l'idea dello screening sulle popolazioni interessate della Campania e dei Comuni di Taranto e Statte. Con onestà intellettuale, però, occorre precisare e significare che con quell'attività di controllo sanitario si realizza una prevenzione secondaria sulla popolazione (che resta sempre un succedaneo della prevenzione primaria), spesso utilizzata per rabbonire la gente, che invece necessita di opere di bonifica, prevenzione e tutela ambientale vere. Pur con i rilievi critici appena effettuati, le norme fin qui commentate danno un contribuito positivo alla soluzione delle emergenze ambientali cui sono dedicate. Tra le stesse, si prevede anche l'espressa introduzione nel codice dell'ambiente del reato di combustione illecita di rifiuti, fattispecie finora non sussistente nel nostro sistema penale. È bene però ricordare, così come è stato fatto in un ordine del giorno proposto dai colleghi della Lega, il problema di chi brucia, per tradizione agricola, ramaglie e scarti di potatura: questa fattispecie non potrà essere assoggettata a sanzioni penali, come la pena da due a cinque anni prevista nel caso dei roghi della Terra dei fuochi o di altri dello stesso impatto. Lì è bene che il Governo, così come si è detto stamattina, assuma un impegno in questo senso. Oltre ai roghi di rifiuti, ci sono altre novità importanti nel decreto-legge. Tornando alla questione specifica dell'Ilva, è il caso di sottolineare che il decreto - l'ennesimo prodotto dal Governo sulla questione - si pone il fine di perfezionare la compatibilità tra il decreto di approvazione del piano industriale e l'autorizzazione integrata ambientale. Tale espressa previsione ha il merito di far convergere l'esigenza strettamente industriale con quella di natura ambientale. Questo è proprio il problema dei problemi che ha caratterizzato la vicenda sofferta dalla città ionica e dalla sua popolazione. Il decreto, inoltre, alla luce dell'esperienza degli scorsi mesi, concede al commissario la possibilità di richiedere nuove e più ingenti somme al titolare dell'impresa commissariata o di reperirle con aumento di capitale, nel caso si tratti di società. Anche tale previsione è rilevante. Devo però condividere le medesime preoccupazioni esternate nel dibattito alla Camera dei deputati dall'onorevole Chiarelli, il quale ha fatto notare che se molta parte delle risorse disponibili per l'Ilva deve derivare dai sequestri operati nei confronti dei proprietari, allora è il caso di sottolineare che il primo provvedimento emesso dai giudici di Taranto è già stato vanificato dalla Suprema corte e che il provvedimento di sequestro emesso dal tribunale di Milano è ben lungi dal poter assicurare risorse certe alla gestione del commissario. Un'altra parte del decreto che deve essere osservata positivamente è quella riguardante le gestioni commissariali per il dissesto idrogeologico. Degna di attenzione, in particolare, è la norma che consente la nomina quali commissari straordinari di presidenti o assessori delle Regioni interessate. Se ciò avverrà finiranno le gare di gomiti per la nomina di improbabili esperti, spesso collocati dalla stessa politica per dare qualche poltrona in più. Significativa, Ministro, la vicenda ultima del commissario per la Puglia. È legittimo chiedersi se non sia meglio coinvolgere gli amministratori locali, che conoscono appieno i problemi del proprio territorio, e magari non costano nulla. Le ragioni fin qui esposte ci inducono a evidenziare che il decreto in esame, comunque, ha l'indiscusso merito di affrontare in modo più omogeneo che in passato questioni spinose e non risolte da decenni. È forse un primo esile strumento legislativo, suscettibile di perfezionamenti e implementazioni. Al centro di siffatto testo vi è certamente l'idea condivisa che la tutela della salute della popolazione non deve essere un mero enunciato del legislatore costituzionale, ma un obiettivo quotidiano per il quale spendere ogni nostra energia e risorsa. Se ciò avverrà, come dicevo all'inizio, in un quadro sempre più oggettivo e univoco di conoscenza e dati certi, allora avremo reso più agevole il ruolo di tutti coloro che sono tenuti a decisioni difficili e a volte esiziali per i nostri territori. Peraltro, si produrrà il virtuoso effetto collaterale di evitare che ogni questione ambientale sia accompagnata da allarmismi di vario genere, che turbano e rischiano di fuorviare il dibattito su argomenti così complessi come quello sottoposto al nostro esame. Queste ultime motivazioni, Presidente, unite alle ragioni esposte in precedenza, ci conducono come Gruppo di Forza Italia a esprimere un voto favorevole alla conversione in legge del presente decreto-legge.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7871177792549133, 0.21288222074508667]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, il testo che è stato approvato dalla Commissione si compone di due articoli e reca disposizioni in materia di tutela dei lavoratori pubblici o privati che segnalino o denuncino reati o altre condotte illecite di cui siano venuti a conoscenza nell'ambito del proprio rapporto di lavoro. <p> Con l'espressione anglosassone whistleblowing - così viene definita tale pratica - si indica un importante strumento nella lotta alla corruzione che permette di scoprire e, quindi, perseguire illeciti che vengano commessi all'interno delle società. Il whistleblower, infatti, è un soggetto che decide spontaneamente di segnalare le violazioni di cui sia a conoscenza, che siano passate, presenti o future. È di facile intuizione come tale fenomeno assuma una sempre maggiore rilevanza, soprattutto nello scoprire frodi che altrimenti sarebbero molto difficili da individuare. Il whistleblowing è ampiamente conosciuto e regolato negli Stati Uniti - ad esempio - dove, proprio grazie alla collaborazione di singoli individui, la Security and exchange commission (SEC), un ente governativo che si occupa del controllo dei mercati, ha intrapreso numerose azioni nei confronti di varie compagnie, azioni che hanno portato a sanzioni multimilionarie in capo ai trasgressori. Gli Stati Uniti tutelano da tempo coloro che collaborano alla denuncia di comportamenti fraudolenti o irregolari, permettendone quindi la sanzione. Diverse leggi americane si occupano di regolamentare il whistleblowing, prevedendo tutta una serie di vantaggi e garanzie a favore dei singoli whistleblower; alcune di queste leggi assumono grande rilevanza anche in Italia e in tutto il mondo, in ragione del loro carattere transnazionale. Non solo in America esistono svariate leggi che regolamentano questo istituto. La sua tutela risulta molto più ampia e dettagliata, prevedendo tutta una serie di vantaggi e garanzie a favore dei singoli whistleblower, ed è compresa in una strategia complessiva volta addirittura a incentivare il fenomeno. Il sistema americano prevede - ad esempio - anche misure robuste di premi a favore di coloro che segnalano violazioni e illeciti. Nonostante il whistleblowing sia uno strumento efficace nella lotta alla corruzione, il nostro ordinamento si occupa del fenomeno solamente in modo indiretto e asistematico, e non trova ancora una specifica regolamentazione nel sistema giuridico italiano. Il disegno di legge in discussione tenta, quindi, di apprestare una prima tutela al fenomeno del whistleblowing, senza pretendere di raggiungere subito i risultati di altre legislazioni, cercando di introdurre miglioramenti nella situazione presente. Naturalmente tradurre e trasporre gli istituti di cultura anglosassone nella situazione e nell'ordinamento italiano non è sempre così semplice. E non è facile neanche forzare i limiti finanziari, e a tale proposito riferirò anche dei pareri della Commissione bilancio che ha bocciato l'ipotesi di istituire un fondo apposito. Nello specifico, l'articolo 1 modifica l'attuale disciplina riferita ai lavoratori pubblici di cui all'articolo 54- bis del decreto legislativo n. 165 del 2001, mentre l'articolo 2 concerne i lavoratori del settore privato. La riforma, pur confermando il principio di tutela già in vigore, in base al quale l'autore della segnalazione o della denuncia non può essere sottoposto a misure aventi effetti negativi, diretti o indiretti, sulle condizioni di lavoro, presenta una serie di elementi di novità. L'ambito di applicazione della disciplina è esteso ai lavoratori pubblici diversi dai lavoratori dipendenti (collaboratori o consulenti), nonché ai lavoratori, collaboratori e consulenti degli enti pubblici economici, a quelli degli enti di diritto privato sottoposti a controllo pubblico, ai lavoratori e ai collaboratori di imprese fornitrici di beni o servizi e che realizzino opere in favore dell'amministrazione pubblica. Le disposizioni previste si applicano alle segnalazioni effettuate nell'interesse dell'integrità della pubblica amministrazione. Riguardo ai possibili soggetti destinatari della segnalazione, la novella sostituisce il riferimento al superiore gerarchico con quello al responsabile della prevenzione della corruzione: figura presente in ogni pubblica amministrazione ai sensi dell'articolo 1, comma 7, della legge n. 190 del 2012. Resta ferma l'ipotesi di segnalazione all'Autorità nazionale anticorruzione (ANAC) o di denuncia all'autorità giudiziaria ordinaria o contabile. In merito al principio di tutela, si prevede che l'adozione di misure ritenute ritorsive sia comunicata in ogni caso all'ANAC, da parte dell'interessato o delle organizzazioni sindacali maggiormente rappresentative, e che questa informi il Dipartimento della funzione pubblica o gli altri organismi di garanzia per le determinazioni di competenza. A tale proposito, si ricorda che la norma vigente prevede, invece, che l'interessato o i sindacati segnalino le misure ritenute discriminatorie al Dipartimento della funzione pubblica. Si introduce, per il caso di adozione di una misura discriminatoria, una sanzione amministrativa pecuniaria da 10.000 a 50.000 euro, a carico del responsabile che abbia adottato la misura, fermi restando gli altri profili di responsabilità e tenuto conto della dimensione dell'ente a cui si riferisce la segnalazione. Si introduce l'inversione dell'onere della prova a carico del datore di lavoro, il quale dovrà dimostrare che le misure discriminatorie o ritorsive, adottate nei confronti del segnalante, siano motivate da ragioni estranee alla segnalazione stessa, confermando la nullità degli atti discriminatori o ritorsivi adottati dal datore di lavoro nei confronti del lavoratore. E, qualora ne venga accertato l'illegittimo licenziamento, si dispone il reintegro nel posto di lavoro, anche con ordinanza ingiuntiva del tribunale, oltre al risarcimento per eventuali danni morali, economici o di carriera subiti nonché al rimborso delle spese legali sostenute. La sussistenza di una misura discriminatoria è accertata dall'ANAC, che è altresì competente a irrogare la relativa sanzione. Si modifica anche la tutela della riservatezza circa l'identità dell'autore della segnalazione, limitando la vigente deroga al principio di riservatezza al caso in cui la conoscenza dell'identità sia indispensabile per la difesa dell'incolpato, purché la contestazione sia fondata, anche solo parzialmente, sulla segnalazione e solo in presenza di consenso da parte dell'interessato. Si conferma, invece, che alle segnalazioni in oggetto non si applica la disciplina sul diritto di accesso agli atti di cui alla legge n. 241 del 1990. È affidata all'ANAC, sentito il Garante per la protezione dei dati personali, la predisposizione di linee guida per la presentazione e la gestione delle segnalazioni che garantiscano la riservatezza del dipendente segnalante. Sono previsti meccanismi sanzionatori per i casi sia di assenza di procedure per l'inoltro e la gestione delle segnalazioni, sia di adozione di procedure non conformi a quelle previste dalla normativa. Sul punto, sulla base dei lavori svolti in Commissione, sono introdotte specifiche sanzioni qualora venga accertato il mancato svolgimento di attività di verifica delle segnalazioni ricevute da parte del responsabile, applicando a quest'ultimo una sanzione amministrativa pecuniaria da 10.000 a 50.000 euro. Medesima sanzione è prevista nei casi di assenza di procedure per l'inoltro e la gestione delle segnalazioni, ovvero nei casi di adozione di procedure non conformi a quelle predisposte dall'ANAC. Come è facilmente intuibile, la scelta di aumentare le sanzioni nei casi di assenza delle procedure per la segnalazione e nei casi di mancato riscontro delle segnalazioni ricevute è dovuta alla volontà di prevenire condotte omissive che avrebbero effetti diretti sulla funzionalità e sull'efficacia della segnalazione stessa. L'applicazione delle tutele non è garantita nei casi in cui sia accertata, anche con sentenza di primo grado, la responsabilità penale del segnalante per i reati di calunnia o diffamazione o comunque per reati commessi con la medesima segnalazione, ovvero la sua responsabilità civile, per lo stesso titolo, nei casi di dolo o colpa grave. L'articolo 2 del disegno di legge estende al settore privato la tutela del dipendente o collaboratore che segnali illeciti, attraverso modifiche all'articolo 6 del decreto legislativo n. 231 del 2001. In particolare, è integrata la disciplina sulla responsabilità amministrativa degli enti privati derivante da reati. La disciplina concerne gli enti, società e associazioni (anche prive di personalità giuridica) privati, nonché gli enti pubblici economici. In base a questa normativa, essi sono responsabili per i reati commessi da determinati soggetti nell'interesse o a vantaggio dell'ente. La responsabilità di quest'ultimo è esclusa qualora ricorrano alcune condizioni, tra cui l'adozione e l'attuazione di modelli di organizzazione e gestione aventi determinati requisiti. Le novelle all'articolo 6 del decreto legislativo n. 231 del 2001 integrano i requisiti stabiliti per i suddetti modelli. Nello specifico, essi devono contemplare, a carico di coloro che a qualsiasi titolo dirigano o collaborino con l'ente, l'obbligo di presentare segnalazioni circostanziate di illeciti o di violazioni del modello di organizzazione e gestione dell'ente, di cui siano venuti a conoscenza in ragione delle funzioni svolte. Si prevedono canali alternativi di segnalazione, di cui almeno uno idoneo a garantire, anche con modalità informatiche, la riservatezza dell'identità del segnalante, nonché misure idonee a tutelare l'identità del segnalante e le relative sanzioni nei confronti di chi violi le misure di tutela del segnalante, nonché di chi effettui, con dolo o colpa grave, segnalazioni che si rivelino infondate. È previsto il divieto di atti di ritorsione o discriminatori, diretti o indiretti, nei confronti del segnalante per motivi collegati alla segnalazione. Si specifica, inoltre, che l'adozione di misure discriminatorie nei confronti dei soggetti che effettuino le segnalazioni può essere denunciata all'Ispettorato nazionale del lavoro, per i provvedimenti di propria competenza, oltre che dal segnalante anche dall'organizzazione sindacale indicata dal medesimo. Infine, anche per il settore pubblico, si sancisce la nullità dei licenziamenti o di altre misure ritorsive o discriminatorie, adottati nei confronti del segnalante, ivi compreso il mutamento di mansioni, e si pone a carico del datore di lavoro l'onere della prova che le misure organizzative adottate successivamente alla segnalazione siano fondate su ragioni estranee alla segnalazione stessa. Molte cose - il dibattito in Commissione l'ha evidenziato e immagino che altrettanto farà quello in Aula - si potranno aggiustare, anche alla luce dell'esperienza concreta, ma si tratta indubbiamente di un passo avanti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7575597763061523, 0.24244020879268646]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, la revisione costituzionale è invecchiata prima di nascere. È rivolta al passato, sigilla il presente, non dice nulla al futuro del Paese. <p> Le decisioni più importanti sono rinviate o nascoste o negate. È rinviata la riduzione del numero delle Regioni. È nascosta la cancellazione del Senato. È negata la riduzione del numero dei deputati. <p> Diventa più difficile e più conflittuale il rapporto tra Stato e Regioni, poiché entrambi i livelli sono dotati di competenze definite esclusive, che non possono quindi trovare alcuna mediazione dopo la cancellazione della legislazione concorrente. Il superamento delle piccole Regioni, invece, avrebbe creato macroregioni più adatte a cooperare con la politica nazionale e a muoversi nello spazio europeo. Il Governo ha promesso di realizzarle con una prossima revisione costituzionale, ammettendo clamorosamente che oggi si approva una legge non risolutiva. <p> Il nuovo procedimento legislativo è farraginoso. Aumentano i conflitti di competenza e si producono nuovi contenziosi presso la Consulta. <p> Palazzo Madama diventa un dopolavoro per amministratori locali, un'Assemblea senza prestigio che cercherà di riguadagnare i poteri perduti ricorrendo allo scambio consociativo con il Governo. Se doveva cadere così in basso, era più dignitoso abolirlo. <p> In una sola Camera era ineludibile definire i contrappesi del sistema maggioritario: votazioni qualificate sui diritti fondamentali, poteri di iniziativa delle minoranze, controllo dell'attività governativa. Il monocameralismo ben temperato è preferibile a un bicameralismo pasticciato. La maldestra propaganda sui costi della politica si è arenata in Transatlantico. Si conserva l'anomalia di una Camera di 630 membri, che non ha pari in alcun Parlamento europeo. Un'Assemblea tanto grande quanto debole, i cui membri devono tutto alla nomina dei capipartito oppure all'aumento dei seggi connessi con l'elezione del Premier. Si doveva invece ridurre il numero dei deputati e selezionarli nei collegi uninominali, senza ricorrere ai signori delle preferenze e ai nominati dell'Italicum; si sarebbe dovuta rafforzare l'autorevolezza della Camera nei confronti dell'Esecutivo. La democrazia americana, pur guidando un impero, non ha mai rinunciato all'equilibrio di poteri tra Governo e Parlamento. Perché allora tante occasioni perse? La mancanza di una vera riforma ha prodotto un testo lunghissimo, di scadente fattura normativa, di sgradevole gergo burocratico. Basta leggere, ad esempio, le ulteriori competenze del Senato definite - cito testualmente - nelle «leggi di cui agli articoli 57, sesto comma, 80, secondo periodo, 114, terzo comma 117, quinto e nono comma, 119, sesto comma, 120, secondo comma, 122, primo comma, e 132, secondo comma». Sì, è scritto proprio così: sembra un decreto milleproroghe, e invece è un brano costituzionale: uno scarabocchio che offende l'italiano semplice e intenso dei Costituenti. <p> Da come parli capisco che cosa vuoi, suggerisce il buon senso popolare: la forma sciatta rivela il basso profilo politico. <p> Il vizio di origine consiste nel cambiare la Costituzione per stabilizzare un Governo altrimenti privo del mandato elettorale. Bisognava modificare subito il Porcellum per restituire la parola agli elettori. Invece, l'esigenza politica contingente prevale su ogni garanzia istituzionale, fino al paradosso di riscrivere la Seconda parte della Carta in un Parlamento eletto in forma illegittima. <p> In Italia non si governa per migliorare lo Stato; si cambia lo Stato per rafforzare il Governo. Al contrario, le Costituzioni disciplinano la politica perché conquistano la lunga durata. Su questo principio sono fallite le riforme dell'ultimo ventennio, approvate sempre da una parte contro l'altra, per puntellare i Governi che avevano perso la fiducia degli elettori. Così fece Berlusconi nel 2005 e - ahimè! - anche la mia parte con il Titolo V. Si ripetono tutti gli errori già commessi da destra e da sinistra, mettendoci anzi oggi più entusiasmo, fino a chiedere un plebiscito personale. <p> Il presidente Renzi è il grande conservatore della seconda Repubblica. Si erige un monumento alle ideologie del ventennio proprio mentre tramontano in tutta Europa. <p> Tutto era cominciato negli anni Novanta, con le speranze di una sorta di modello Westminster all'italiana. Oggi il bipolarismo è in affanno anche in quell'antico palazzo inglese; non esiste più in Spagna, è travolto in Francia dal lepenesimo, è sterilizzato dalle larghe intese in Germania. L'Italicum e la legge Boschi si accaniscono a tenerlo in vita artificialmente, ricorrendo al premierato assoluto senza contrappesi: una minoranza del 20 per cento degli aventi diritto al voto conquista il banco e impone la propria volontà alla maggioranza del Paese. Tutto ciò aumenta l'astensionismo e riduce il consenso verso la competizione bipolare. Ovunque la vecchia dialettica tra i partiti è travolta dalla nuova frattura tra élite e popolo. I Paesi europei sono diventati ingovernabili per eccesso di governabilità. Si è dimenticata una semplice verità: per guidare le società frammentate di oggi occorre un consenso più ampio di quello di ieri; le classi politiche debbono imparare a convincere i popoli piuttosto che ridurre la rappresentanza; i premi di maggioranza alla lunga non riescono a surrogare gli elettori che non votano. Si è ridotta la politica a mera amministrazione di sistema. Da qui è scaturito il primato degli Esecutivi sui Parlamenti. Ma nell'orizzonte europeo tornano i grandi dilemmi della pace e della guerra, dei limiti e dei nessi tra religione e politica, dell'accoglienza e del rifiuto dei migranti, della libertà individuale e dell'etica pubblica, della potenza tecnologica e della intangibilità della vita, dello sviluppo economico e della durata del pianeta. Non sono problemi risolvibili dagli Esecutivi, sono i conflitti contemporanei che hanno bisogno di nuovi riconoscimenti culturali e politici e saranno possibili solo in una inedita democrazia parlamentare come non l'abbiamo ancora conosciuta. Quella del secolo passato seppe neutralizzare i conflitti fra Stato e Chiesa, città e campagna, capitale e lavoro. Sono ancora da immaginare i Parlamenti capaci di ricomporre le fratture della civiltà europea nel nuovo secolo. Il mondo che abbiamo davanti è molto diverso da quello degli anni Novanta. Le riforme istituzionali della Seconda Repubblica sono ormai vecchi arnesi.

Una discussione avvitata su se stessa, infatti, ha avuto sia l\\'effetto di mutilare la portata del disegno di legge, cancellando dal dibattito il titolo relativo alle convivenze, sia quello di far apparire il tema delle adozioni come costitutivo della disciplina delle unioni civili, così inducendo l\\'idea che chi si oppone o ha dubbi sull\\'articolo 5 non voglia riconoscere le unioni stesse. <p> Procedo con ordine. È merito del <PARTY>, di tutto il <PARTY>, l\\'aver portato al voto in Aula questo provvedimento che, in linea con gli articoli 2 e 3 della Costituzione, regola le convivenze, completando il quadro ordinamentale di quello che io amo chiamare il diritto dell\\'affettività. E andando contro corrente, sottolineo che la regolamentazione delle convivenze civili non è meno importante, non solo per l\\'estensione del fenomeno, di quella delle unioni civili. La disciplina delle convivenze, infatti, offre tutela non solo alle convivenze more uxorio, ma anche alle convivenze di solidarietà, che spesso sono la conseguenza dell\\'abbandono delle persone da parte dei familiari e della fuga di questi dai loro doveri etici e giuridici. E ancora: la disciplina delle convivenze riconosce, giusto il secondo comma dell\\'articolo 3 della Costituzione, il diritto delle persone di scegliere il grado di vincolatività giuridica da dare alle proprie relazioni affettive. lo non credo che tutto questo incentivi alla deresponsabilizzazione, ma credo al contrario che aiuti ad una maggiore consapevolezza, oltretutto tutelando la parte debole. È parimenti merito del <PARTY>, di tutto il <PARTY>, aver portato la disciplina delle unioni civili al voto in quest\\'Aula; una disciplina che offre alle coppie omossessuali la possibilità di formalizzare il loro legame e di dare riconoscimento e tutela legale allo stesso. In questo contesto (e non in altri artificiosamente costruiti) si inserisce, quanto alle unioni civili, il tema dell\\'adozione del figlio del partner. È di tutta evidenza - ribadisco - che discutere questo profilo non significa mettere in discussione il riconoscimento delle unioni medesime, che dell\\'adozione, al contrario, sono l\\'ineludibile presupposto. Peraltro, è altrettanto evidente che porre il problema di una disciplina dell\\'adozione che, in coerenza con la disciplina della legge n. 40, si preoccupi di rendere più effettivo il divieto della maternità surrogata, è iniziativa che, lungi dall\\'essere oppositiva, si pone il problema di rendere più adeguata la regolamentazione legale delle adozioni medesime. Muoversi in questo orizzonte, infatti, significa non negarsi il problema della necessità di una normativa non solo e non tanto coerente con il quadro ordinamentale, che prevede il reato della maternità surrogata, ma soprattutto attenta al bilanciamento tra il diritto di essere genitori e quello di essere figli, entrambi riconducibili ai diritti inviolabili dell\\'uomo, che la Repubblica deve riconoscere e tutelare, ai sensi dell\\'articolo 2 della Costituzione. Tale normativa va declinata alla luce del secondo comma dell\\'articolo 3 della Costituzione, notoriamente norma fondante della nostra Carta, frutto del superamento della visione illuministica (limitata alla declaratoria legale dei diritti) e che si fonda sul riconoscimento dell\\'assoluta centralità della persona umana, di ciascuna e di tutte, ponendo così la questione del limite del diritto di ciascuno in rapporto al diritto dell\\'altro. Questo rende incostituzionale ogni visione assoluta di un diritto, che inevitabilmente sarebbe inconciliabile con il principio fondamentale del bilanciamento dei e tra i diritti, che impedisce che qualcuno, in nome del suo diritto, prevarichi quello di altri. È la città di tutti per tutti: quella degli inderogabili doveri di solidarietà politica, economica e sociale e del pieno sviluppo della personalità umana. In questo quadro colloco la mia riflessione sull\\'articolo 5, ossia sulla stepchild adoption. I corni del problema sono riassumibili nel momento seguente. Da un lato mi affido alle parole di chi ha sostenuto che: «Occorre assicurare che chi si prenda cura del bambino adottato abbia la giusta motivazione e abbia anche i mezzi e le capacità per assicurarne una crescita serena. Chi è in tale condizione? Certamente anzitutto una famiglia composta da un uomo e una donna che abbiano saggezza e maturità e che possano assicurare una serie di relazioni interfamiliari (...). In mancanza di ciò è chiaro che anche altre persone, al limite anche i single, potrebbero dare di fatto alcune garanzie essenziali. Non mi chiuderei perciò a una sola possibilità, ma lascerei ai responsabili di vedere quale è la migliore soluzione di fatto, qui e adesso, per questo bambino o bambina. Lo scopo è di assicurare il massimo di condizioni favorevoli concretamente possibili. Perciò, quando è data la possibilità di scegliere, occorre scegliere il meglio». Dall\\'altro, rinvio alla seguente riflessione: «È un\\'epoca in cui ci sentiamo sottoposti a varie minacce, il discrimine tra il naturale e l\\'artificiale si mescola, non ci sono solo \"magnifiche sorti e progressive\". È una deriva per cui la società non esiste ma esistono solo gli individui. Come si fa a dire, per esempio, che avere un figlio è un diritto? Come si può pensare di declinare tutto nella chiave della libertà individuale, come se ciò che accade prescindesse dal modo in cui si compongono le volontà e le coscienze dei gruppi umani?». Sono le riflessioni di Carlo Maria Martini e di Giuseppe Vacca: le riflessioni di due personalità con storie e culture profondamente diverse, ma mosse con evidenza da quell\\'onestà intellettuale che non impedisce ad un principe della Chiesa (già nel 2008) di riconoscere che l\\'adozione non può essere preclusa anche ad «altre persone, al limite anche i single », purché tutto si muova con attenzione all\\'interesse del bambino per assicurargli «il massimo di condizioni favorevoli», e ad un filosofo marxista di dire che avere un figlio non è un diritto e che non tutto si può declinare nella libertà individuale e nei diritti individuali atomisticamente considerati. I termini di una discussione realmente laica e costituzionalmente orientata sono, a mio parere, esattamente questi. Su queste basi, come dimostrano anche emendamenti a mia prima firma, riconosco che il partner dell\\'unione civile possa adottare il figlio dell\\'altro partner, non per un suo diritto alla genitorialità (che non ha neanche il coniuge), ma se ed in quanto ciò sia nell\\'interesse esclusivo del figlio. E aggiungo che, nel contesto di una riforma della legge sulle adozioni, sono convinto che debba essere disciplinata, sottraendola alle possibili oscillazioni della giurisprudenza, anche la legittimazione dei componenti delle unioni civili all\\'adozione tout court, purché nell\\'interesse esclusivo del bambino. Come ha ammonito il cardinale Martini, infatti, l\\'orfanotrofio o la casa famiglia non sono, sempre e comunque, la soluzione migliore in assenza di una coppia eterosessuale di genitori adottivi. Al contrario, l\\'esperienza concreta porta oggettivamente a constatare la superiore qualità di rapporti personalizzati e stretti e la decisività di questi ultimi per la crescita dei bambini ove manchi la condizione naturale. Aggiungo anche che, ferme restando tutte le verifiche previste dalla legge sulle adozioni, ho presentato più emendamenti che riconoscono l\\'adottabilità da parte del partner per i figli già nati. Per il futuro, però, non si può prescindere dalla effettività del divieto della maternità surrogata. Lo dicono in tanti, con sensibilità diverse, con storie diverse, avendo attenzione tanto alla condizione della donna, che affitta l\\'utero, quanto al bambino così concepito. E sappiamo che, purtroppo, il problema è universale, cioè etero e omo, con le deviazioni che giungono fin alla pretesa di essere madre e genitori senza nemmeno l\\'onere della gravidanza, fino alla possibilità della scelta a tavolino della madre e del padre biologici da parte dei genitori legali. Summa lex, summa iniuria. Davvero vogliamo non aprirci laicamente all\\'evidenza della questione? Davvero vogliamo negarci l\\'oggettività del tema? Davvero non vogliamo aprirci al dubbio e ammettere che il problema della maternità surrogata vada affrontato in connessione con le stepchild adoption (sia chiaro, pure per le coppie eterosessuali)? Davvero vogliamo ostinarci a credere che una disciplina più analitica, che, riconosciuta l\\'adottabilità dei bambini già nati, garantisca, per il futuro, una maggiore effettività del divieto della maternità surrogata sia una cancellazione o, peggio, dell\\'articolo 5? Accettiamo la sfida del confronto, e non della contrapposizione pregiudiziale, e costruiamo in quest\\'Aula la soluzione: è già scritta in molte riflessioni emerse in questa discussione generale e in tanti emendamenti a questo disegno di legge.

Signor Presidente, la più ferrea volontà di evitare le polemiche si smonta ogni qualvolta ed in ogni minima occasione in cui veniamo a conoscenza di nuove notizie. Apprendo adesso, alla fine della Conferenza dei Capigruppo, dal Presidente del nostro Gruppo di opposizione, che sarebbe stata inviata - e fin qui niente di disdicevole - una lettera dei Presidenti di Gruppo delle forze che sostengono il Governo alla presidente Casellati per rimarcare ed in qualche modo lamentare il comportamento della Ragioneria di Stato in occasione della ratifica del decreto-legge sul PNRR. A fronte di questo, sembra - Presidente, credo che lei mi possa dare ulteriore conferma - che la Presidente avrebbe risposto ai soli Presidenti di maggioranza per garantire un intervento presso il Governo. Ora, se posso capire che i membri della maggioranza abbiano interesse a coalizzarsi in un'azione comune, come politicamente è assolutamente legittimo, non capisco come la Presidenza del Senato possa agire soltanto in nome e per conto della maggioranza stessa. Delle due l'una, Presidente: o smettiamo una volta per tutte di riempirci la bocca in ogni occasione con la centralità del Parlamento, con la democrazia, con tutte le cose che diciamo quando vogliamo supportare questo baraccone che è diventato ormai il Parlamento italiano <p> , oppure diciamo che c'è una chiara e netta volontà di marginalizzare il dissenso, perché una volta è la Presidente del Senato che fa quello che deve fare solo con la maggioranza, una volta sono gli emendamenti posti a margine di un decreto-legge che ha ad oggetto elezioni che si sono già svolte, con i quali si vuole garantire l'esenzione dalla raccolta delle firme per le prossime elezioni. <p> Dobbiamo anche dire chiaramente, Presidente, che la posizione della questione di fiducia oggi è qualcosa di vergognoso, mi permetta il termine, forse poco indicato. Sono stati presentati 23 emendamenti, che con la sua conduzione dei lavori - posso testimoniarlo da membro di questa Assemblea - si sarebbero esauriti in dieci minuti. È stato cancellato tutto per impedire all'opposizione di questo Paese di far dire agli altri membri che a noi verrà imposta la raccolta delle firme mentre gli altri partiti - non so se più piccoli o più grandi, non mi permetto di fare sondaggi approssimativi, so soltanto che sono partiti che hanno la nostra stessa identica conformazione, se non più piccola, perché noi siamo 13, Presidente, ma non so quanti siano in questa sede i rappresentanti del Gruppo di Calenda - non avranno l'impegno di dover raccogliere le firme. <p> Per non parlare di tutte le altre occasioni, dell'aspetto mediatico. Abbiamo scritto - il senatore Barachini, Presidente della Commissione di vigilanza Rai, ne è testimone - tre lettere alla Presidenza Rai perché si attribuisca, a norma di legge, la metà di quel 30 per cento di spazi di comunicazione che spetta alle opposizioni, mentre l'altra metà spetta naturalmente a <PARTY>, che io ritengo ufficialmente opposizione e poi nei fatti abbiamo visto tutti che non lo è. Noi vorremo quel 15 per cento di spazi che ci spetta almeno sulla televisione pubblica; non solo non lo abbiamo, ma non abbiamo neanche la possibilità di avere un incontro con la dirigenza Rai per poter esprimere la nostra volontà di dare un contributo: il pensiero unico è l'unica cosa che non serve a questo Paese. Noi siamo contro il pensiero unico, Presidente, e speriamo che persone come lei, che hanno fatto per anni battaglie contro questa deriva antidemocratica, ci permettano di avere pari trattamento. Non pretendiamo niente di più e niente di meno del pari trattamento rispetto agli altri partiti dell'opposizione e rispetto soprattutto ai cittadini che ci ascoltano e vogliono vedere garantita la libertà in queste altissime Camere che rappresentano tutti loro.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5005526542663574, 0.49944740533828735]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> <PARTY>LLON (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, vorrei focalizzare l'attenzione dell'intera Assemblea su un fatto che si è verificato pochi giorni fa. Sono appena decorse le festività natalizie e, ancora una volta, anche quest'anno, molti padri e madri non le hanno potuto trascorrere con i loro bambini a causa del fenomeno della sottrazione internazionale di minori. Ma, soprattutto, alcuni bambini non sono potuti stare con la loro mamma o il loro papà per siffatto fenomeno. I numeri sono di tutto rispetto: dall'annuario statistico del Ministero degli affari esteri e delle cooperazione internazionale risultano 281 casi solo nello scorso anno, 102 dei quali nella sola Unione europea. Alcuni Paesi interessati - in particolare la Slovacchia - sembrano non volersi attenere alle convenzioni internazionali sul punto. Abbiamo, tra l'altro, il caso dell'Associazione International child abduction Slovakia, che è dovuta intervenire presso l'ambasciatore della Repubblica slovacca Jan Soth, in quanto molto spesso gli ordini dei tribunali italiani e slovacchi vengono disattesi nella loro applicazione. Sono stati segnalati al sottoscritto ben sei casi, tra cui quello di Andrea Cavalcanti, che ha vinto tutte le pratiche - sia in Italia che in Slovacchia - ma il cui figlio viene ancora trattenuto in Slovacchia; il caso di Leonardo Rassu che, dopo anni di inutili battaglie, ha cercato di patteggiare con la ex moglie per poter incontrare la figlia, ma molto spesso si reca fino in Slovacchia, per poi dover ritornare senza aver potuto incontrarla; il caso di Emiliano Russo, la cui impossibilità a incontrare la prole gli ha causato una tale situazione di prostrazione da portarlo a contrarre una seria disabilità; il caso di Alessandro Matera, la cui ex compagna slovacca è morta suicida e, nonostante questo, il tribunale slovacco ha preferito affidare il figlio minore al cognato slovacco anziché al padre; il caso di Andreas Masoner, che vede il figlio su Skype ormai da anni, e il caso di Marco Di Marco che, nonostante un provvedimento esecutivo di rimpatrio del tribunale di Ascoli Piceno, nonostante provvedimenti favorevoli dei tribunali regionali di Bratislava e della Corte suprema slovacca, vede il figlio su Skype da quattro anni e mezzo.

Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, familiari, è per me un onore parlare della personalità di Antonio Maccanico, anche perché ho avuto il piacere di conoscerlo personalmente proprio qui, in quest\\'Aula, nella XI legislatura, e di averlo collega nei lavori, richiamati, della Commissione bicamerale De Mita-Iotti. Fu una legislatura breve, quindi l\\'incontro fu abbastanza fugace, però fu quanto mi bastò per cogliere ed apprezzare il garbo della persona e lo spessore della figura. Maccanico aveva qui un ruolo molto particolare, e voglio riportarvi un ricordo preciso di quelle giornate passate con lui. In quella legislatura c\\'erano in quest\\'Aula due grandi personalità della cultura politica e giuridica, Norberto Bobbio, senatore a vita, e Gianfranco Miglio, personalità discussa, discutibile, intelligenza contraddittoria, ma grande intelligenza, e ricordo molto vivamente, avendo avuto la fortuna di essere presente, i dialoghi sui massimi sistemi che nelle pause dei lavori di Assemblea si svolgevano tra queste grandi personalità. Il ruolo di Maccanico era quello di mediatore quando si verificavano - e vi assicuro si verificavano spesso - questi \"scontri di continenti\" tra Bobbio e Miglio. Ed era un grande piacere politico e culturale assistere e partecipare a questi dialoghi. Maccanico non era un totus politicus; come è stato qui ricordato, era un uomo delle istituzioni, prestato alla politica sempre in contingenze critiche e molto peculiari. Quando i problemi si fanno acuti e mancano le soluzioni si fa in genere ricorso a questi uomini, e Maccanico era una di queste riserve della politica e anche dell\\'intellettualità politica e giuridica italiana. Il senatore Compagna ha ricordato come Maccanico non aveva grilli di democrazia diretta: amava il Parlamento ed era un uomo del Parlamento, che si è formato dentro il Parlamento e ha praticato questa sua presenza in modo costante. Si è detto: grand commis. Non userei questa formula, anche perché qui da noi devo riconoscere l\\'impraticabilità di questo modello francese che vedo di nuovo comparire tra le tentazioni di riforma istituzionale. I nostri politici non hanno dietro una formazione di scuola come l\\' École Nationale d\\'Administration (ENA) o come il Polytechnique parigini. Qui da noi carriera da tecnico e carriera da politico sono separate e le personalità che contano, per alternanza, giuocano l\\'uno e l\\'altro ruolo in momenti diversi. Maccanico ha fatto questo in modo egregio. Ha lavorato da tecnico vicino alla Presidenza della Repubblica e alla Presidenza della Camera. È stato ricordato come abbia lasciato la sua impronta sulla Nota aggiuntiva di La Malfa, fondamentale nella storia del nostro Paese. Vorrei altresì ricordare la riforma del 1971dei Regolamenti parlamentari della Camera, di cui Maccanico è stato grande protagonista. Maccanico sta poi da politico in Parlamento e sta da politico nel Governo, fino al ricordato tentativo fallito del 1996. Ed è simbolica la sua scomparsa proprio nel momento in cui questo tentativo, in forme tanto peculiari e diverse, in qualche misura si ripropone. Abbiamo detto grand commis no, ma servitore dello Stato senza dubbio sì. Dovremmo rivalutare questa figura del servitore dello Stato: é una figura un po\\' obsoleta, oggi di sconosciuta, con una patina simpaticamente ottocentesca di impronta liberale e di formazione crociana, fatta di sobrietà, serietà, competenza, volutamente nascosta nelle pieghe delle istituzioni, che è e non appare mai. Una figura da rivalutare proprio oggi, quando siamo abituati ad avere tutto e sempre sulla scena e, poi, vediamo e constatiamo che dietro la scena di molti personaggi, come sotto il vestito, vi è niente. Le istituzioni sono un corpo molto delicato; vanno maneggiate e accudite con molta cura, altrimenti rischiano di rovinarsi. In questi vent\\'anni, a furia di riforme istituzionali a pezzettini, a furia di interventi selvaggi sulle leggi elettorali, questo campo istituzionale si è devastato. Vorrei ricordare uno scritto di Maccanico intitolato «Riforme istituzionali: problemi e prospettive»:è una lectio del 1989-1990 che egli fece ai seminari di studio per funzionari aspiranti al lavoro parlamentare, in cui tirò un pò le somme dell\\'esperienza del Governo De Mita, giudicandolo come il primo Governo di programma. Uno dei punti programmatici fondamentali erano proprio le riforme istituzionali e il rapporto Governo-Parlamento. E lì lui diceva che in Italia c\\'è stata una stabilità politica e una instabilità governativa. Quello che abbiamo visto dopo è, invece, una instabilità governativa che si accompagna ad una instabilità politica. E questa è la ragione profonda anche della crisi di oggi. Maccanico raccomandava, in quella sua lectio, di impiantare il problema delle riforme istituzionali in senso gradualistico, a piccoli passi: questa è una lezione che dovremmo tenere oggi molto presente. Dicevamo che le istituzioni vanno accuratamente seguite e curate. Maccanico era in fondo un manutentore della macchina statale, un grande manutentore, quelli che conoscono benissimo questa macchina, alla perfezione: sanno come funziona, sanno dove si può trovare un guasto e soprattutto sanno dove mettere le mani nel momento in cui questo guasto va riparato. Ecco, di queste figure oggi avremmo molto bisogno, proprio perché questo Stato-macchina è qualcosa che va alleggerito nella sua costruzione e nella sua struttura e quindi riformato, come oggi abbiamo appunto intenzione di fare. Le istituzioni sono questo tramite intermedio tra cittadini e Stato, tra popolo e Governo; indispensabili quindi, perché attraverso di loro passano e devono passare la decisione e la mediazione; sono come un filtro da tenere pulito. Ecco, Maccanico era quello che teneva sempre pulito questo filtro e quindi faceva passare, o almeno aveva l\\'intenzione di far passare lì dentro, decisione e mediazione. Ma lì dentro passa anche la politica. Quando le istituzioni perdono questa funzione, viene a mancare il loro prestigio e, quando viene a mancare il loro prestigio, si innesca quel distacco che sta all\\'origine di questa non più sopportabile - credetemi - crisi dell\\'idea stessa e della pratica stessa della politica. Non la dovremmo più sopportare! <p> Maccanico era certo un membro della élite. Ma, ecco, le élite sono necessarie, come sono necessarie le masse. E il rapporto tra élite e masse va ricostruito per i tempi nuovi, non va azzerato. Questo è il senso e, nello stesso tempo, il compito della riforma che bisogna attuare. Come si seleziona il ceto politico? Non la sua soppressione, ma la sua selezione è il problema. Come si formano i gruppi dirigenti, le classi dirigenti? C\\'è bisogno di direzione dei processi altrettanto di come c\\'è bisogno di partecipazione ai processi di decisione. L\\'alto e il basso devono ricongiungersi, non devono contrapporsi. C\\'è da praticare un percorso di ricostruzione difficile, faticoso, ma necessario, una trama mediatrice tra noi che siamo qui e tutto quanto confusamente preme e spinge fuori da qui. Mi avvio a concludere. La critica sacrosanta di quanto accaduto in questi anni di corruzione, di separazione, di autoreferenzialità e anche di immeritati privilegi del ceto politico va accompagnata ad un riallaccio di continuità tra quanto c\\'è stato l\\'altro ieri e quanto può esserci domani. Ecco, questa è la cura, il ponte che dobbiamo approntare, perché dalla saldezza delle istituzioni, malgrado i guasti della politica (le istituzioni tengono oggi, per fortuna, più e meglio della politica), solo da questa saldezza può venire il vero cambiamento. Bisogna dire che l\\'interruzione traumatica, la rottamazione del passato, è un fatto regressivo, un fatto conservativo: non cambia, ma conserva e ripete. Da lì, da questi strappi, nella trama della storia non sono mai venute nuove soluzioni: sono sempre venuti vecchi ritorni. Mi scuso per questo appunto che può sembrare fastidiosamente paternalistico, ma non lo è e non vuole esserlo: approfitto però di questa occasione per farlo. Vorrei dunque dire alle nuove energie che sono entrate nelle istituzioni, anche in questo ramo del Parlamento: ecco, approfittate della permanenza qui, di questa esperienza, per scoprire e apprezzare figure come quella che stiamo commemorando, perché c\\'è tutto da imparare. Attrezzarsi di una cultura istituzionale è essenziale, è indispensabile per un buon agire pubblico, altrimenti - guardate - si gira come pale al vento, a seconda di come il vento gira: questo è quanto non possiamo permetterci in questo purgatorio antipolitico. Un\\'ultima osservazione, signor Presidente: sono in preparazione, da quanto so, per la casa editrice \"Il Mulino\", due preziosi volumi di diari inediti di Antonio Maccanico riguardanti la sua collaborazione alla Presidenza Pertini. Quando appariranno pubblicamente facciamo in modo di presentarli qui, con gli ottimi funzionari della Biblioteca del Senato, approfittando di quell\\'evento per riprendere il discorso su Maccanico in modo meno celebrativo, ma entrando più nel merito e nei contenuti della sua persona, perché ne abbiamo bisogno tutti, ne ha bisogno il Paese, ne ha bisogno l\\'Italia.', 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.6018065214157104, 0.39819350838661194]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> CONTE (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, rappresentanti del Governo, il Gruppo del <PARTY> voterà a favore di questo provvedimento, che si è reso necessario per contenere il rapporto deficit <PARTY>L entro il 3 per cento, attraverso il rientro dallo scostamento determinato dall'inasprimento della crisi economica nel 2013 che ha ridotto purtroppo la capacità di crescita del Paese. Voglio dire con molta nettezza alla senatrice Bonfrisco che il rispetto degli impegni con i partner europei è una scelta di serietà, che ci consente e potrà consentirci, senza la subalternità che hanno avuto i Governi precedenti, in particolare il Governo Berlusconi, di far valere le ragioni del nostro Paese, ancora di più nel prossimo futuro, nei luoghi in cui si dovrà decidere un futuro diverso per l'Europa. <p> Questa è la serietà: mantenere gli impegni è la condizione fondamentale per cambiare le regole, per ridisegnare un futuro di sviluppo dell'intera Europa, per passare dagli esercizi ragionieristici e fantasiosi, in cui era maestro il ministro Tremonti, ad un disegno solidale ed inclusivo di sviluppo per l'Europa. Un passaggio tanto più necessario oggi, che vediamo affacciarsi all'orizzonte vecchie e nuove pulsioni antieuropeiste. <p> Noi riteniamo che il peso del riequilibrio, che prevede, come sappiamo, un riparto per due terzi a carico del bilancio dello Stato e per un terzo a carico degli enti locali, sia corretto, seppur comprendiamo che i Comuni italiani si trovano oggi in trincea per cercare di mantenere il livello dei servizi, oltre che dare risposte ai bisogni derivanti dalle nuove povertà, che si stanno sempre più affermando nel nostro Paese. <p> In questo provvedimento viene recepito il rifinanziamento di 120 milioni del fondo di solidarietà e si incentivano le unioni di Comuni, una misura, seppur piccola, necessaria, per tracciare un percorso virtuoso. Va anche detto che la riduzione di 450 milioni sul Patto di stabilità interno 2013 viene compensata nella legge di stabilità con l'allargamento per un miliardo previsto per il 2014. Vogliamo però dire che il tema centrale degli enti locali non è solo la capacità di spesa, ma anche la necessità di superare la troppa segmentazione ordinamentale. Questo è un invito che facciamo al Governo per i prossimi anni. <p> Il decreto contiene ancora altre misure, sulle quali mi dispiace che i colleghi della Lega abbiano ironizzato in maniera poco etica e poco morale. <p> Per esempio, quelle legate all'emergenza di Lampedusa, dove è successo tutto quel che sappiamo: con questo provvedimento viene data una risposta immediata al dramma civile e sociale che ha colpito l'intera comunità nazionale e sul quale non è concesso ad alcuno di speculare per motivi biecamente politici. <p> C'è stato il momento delle lacrime e del cordoglio, ma c'è stato anche il momento delle iniziative concrete, che oggi, approvando questo decreto, diventano strutturali con le risorse per l'accoglienza dei minori stranieri non accompagnati, con un fondo per l'immigrazione da destinare alle donne immigrate in gravidanza. Ecco di cosa stiamo parlando. È un disegno umanitario e civile su cui siamo tutti impegnati e su cui dobbiamo continuare ad impegnarci al di là della polemica politica. <p> Di notevole importanza sono anche le norme in materia di pagamento dei debiti della pubblica amministrazione verso le imprese. Come sappiamo, questo è uno dei punti chiave che potrà consentire all'Italia nel 2014 di realizzare in maniera convinta l'aggancio, che tutti ci auspichiamo, alla ripresa economica. Anche grazie ad alcune modifiche apportate alla Camera al testo originario, con questo provvedimento si rimuovono alcuni ostacoli che impedivano l'accelerazione del pagamento dei debiti della pubblica amministrazione verso le imprese. <p> In particolare - perché non ricordarlo? - si definisce la tempistica, per cui le risorse del 2014 vengono assegnate già tutte entro il 31 marzo 2014, quindi in maniera molto rapida, unitamente alle risorse non utilizzate nel 2013 per anticipazione di liquidità. Si interviene inoltre sul tema spinoso dei pagamenti dei debiti fuori bilancio. Sono scelte importanti, che aiuteranno il mondo delle imprese, sulle quali è necessario, lo diciamo al Governo, un costante monitoraggio per verificarne la puntuale e tempestiva attuazione. <p> Come Gruppo del <PARTY> quindi voteremo a favore della conversione in legge di questo decreto-legge, convinti che rappresenti un ulteriore passo nel difficile percorso di uscita dalla crisi con il risanamento, per far ripartire rapidamente la ripresa. <p> È un messaggio che vale ancor di più, senatrice Bonfrisco, in questi giorni in cui nelle piazze italiane esplode una protesta che certo raccoglie forme di disagio sociale e di malessere, ma che tenta di incanalare verso sbocchi distruttivi, non del Governo, ma degli assetti istituzionali di questo Paese. <p> Io credo che le forze politiche, tutte, al di là della polemica, della discussione e della dialettica che è necessaria, non dovrebbero mai usare la demagogia che ha usato lei, senatrice Bonfrisco, su questi temi. <p> Nella legge di stabilità è stato fatto un grandissimo sforzo per gli autotrasportatori. È stato raggiunto un accordo con le loro rappresentanze. Non lisciamo il pelo a chi vuole distruggere le istituzioni. Stiamo attenti anche a governare queste cose in termini di tornaconto politico, perché non sarà un tornaconto per nessuno, ma solo la distruzione dei nostri assetti istituzionali. <p> Quindi, noi diciamo, anche a queste piazze, che la strada oggi non è quella della demagogia, della violenza o del lisciare il pelo a chi, sconfitto in Parlamento, vuole rifarsi cavalcando la protesta senza sbocchi. <p> La strada e la risposta è che, passo dopo passo, solo con il risanamento e con la serietà si costruiscono le condizioni economico‑sociali per rispondere al dramma della disoccupazione, di chi perde il lavoro, del lavoro autonomo, del lavoro dipendente, delle imprese e delle famiglie, che insieme debbono ricostruire questo Paese. <p> Per questo motivo voteremo a favore e invitiamo il Parlamento ad approvare questo decreto.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6048337817192078, 0.3951662480831146]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto in dissenso dal mio Gruppo. <p> MINEO (<PARTY>).

Cambiano le previsioni macroeconomiche e vengono conseguentemente modificati gli obiettivi programmatici. <p> Nel primo campo si situa il cambiamento positivo delle previsioni di crescita del <PARTY>L che rispetto al DEF passa dallo 0,7 allo 0,9 per cento nel 2015, all'1,6 nel 2016 e nel 2017 per poi assestarsi all'1,5 nel 2018 e all'1,3 nel 2019. Si tratta di un quadro positivo confermato anche dal più recente outlook del Fondo monetario internazionale presentato ieri in un quadro internazionale di rallentamento della crescita con molte ombre e pochissime luci. Il Fondo monetario internazionale ha tagliato dello 0,2 per cento le sue previsioni di crescita globale per quest'anno, portandole al 3,1 per cento, e ha definito l'espansione modesta. È la crescita globale peggiore dai tempi dell'ultima crisi: con il focus sulla situazione delle economie emergenti, il cui rallentamento frena la crescita mondiale. L'Italia, invece, assieme a poche altre economie avanzate, vede salire le proprie stime dello 0,1 per cento, per un possibile 0,8 per cento a fine anno, inferiore a quello del Governo che però viene confermato nel trend e secondo gli analisti dell'OCSE anche nelle dimensioni. Lo stesso rapporto del Fondo monetario internazionale segnala come in Germania crollino gli ordinativi industriali, a conferma degli effetti sull'Europa del rallentamento globale del commercio. In questo contesto, come si può leggere nella Nota di aggiornamento del DEF in esame, il Governo propone una rimodulazione del tasso di indebitamento netto e del percorso di avvicinamento al pareggio di bilancio che deriva dal ricorso ai margini di flessibilità europei. In sintesi, nella Nota rileviamo un tasso di indebitamento netto delle pubbliche amministrazioni, in rapporto al <PARTY>L, pari al 2,6 per cento per l'anno in corso (in conformità al quadro tendenziale) e pari al 2,2 per cento per il 2016, mentre nel quadro tendenziale il tasso di indebitamento netto è pari all'1,4 per cento per il 2016 e si raggiunge il pareggio di bilancio nel 2017. Come sappiamo, l'Italia è sottoposta al braccio preventivo del Patto di stabilità e crescita a causa di squilibri macroeconomici eccessivi. Per il 2015 il Governo aveva chiesto e ottenuto uno scostamento dello 0,4 per cento verso l'obiettivo di medio termine per la realizzazione di una serie di riforme strutturali in fase di approvazione ed implementazione nell'anno in corso: una possibilità prevista dai trattati tra le forme di flessibilità possibili nel rispetto del Patto di stabilità e crescita in presenza di specifici fattori economici e sociali. Un obiettivo, quello del 2,6 per cento, rispettato pur in presenza di un intervento che si è dovuto rendere necessario dopo la sentenza della Corte costituzionale sulle pensioni. Per il 2016 il Governo propone al Parlamento, e dunque alla Commissione europea, un pieno utilizzo dei margini di flessibilità per le riforme strutturali, con un ulteriore 0,1 per cento che si somma al precedente 0,4 per cento, cui va aggiunto un ulteriore 0,3 per cento di ulteriore flessibilità connesso alla clausola per investimenti. La scelta che il Governo propone al Parlamento con questa Nota di aggiornamento e la relazione trasmessa alle Camere come prescritto dall'articolo 6 della legge di attuazione del pareggio di bilancio, è legata agli scenari macroeconomici internazionali, europei e nazionali. La crescita dell'economia mondiale presenta un quadro disomogeneo, con Paesi che continuano a confermare le proprie performance, come nel caso degli Stati Uniti che crescono nel secondo trimestre in misura maggiore di quanto previsto, al contrario del Giappone che dopo un primo trimestre in crescita vede una battuta di arresto e un ribassamento del <PARTY>L nel secondo trimestre. È però il rallentamento della crescita delle economie emergenti, a partire dalla Cina, a preoccupare e produrre un possibile generale rallentamento della crescita del <PARTY>L mondiale. Anche lo stato del commercio mondiale vede una riduzione di un punto percentuale rispetto alle precedenti previsioni. In Europa la crescita si presenta differenziata e, in ogni caso, inferiore alle attese, soprattutto se si tiene conto della forte riduzione del costo del petrolio e dell'imponente intervento di quantitative easing operato dalla Banca centrale europea. È come se l'Europa pagasse da una parte la sua disomogeneità istituzionale interna, l'incapacità di avere una soggettività unica e una leadership capace di iniziativa mondiale (non solo sul piano economico) e, dall'altra, l'incapacità di rinnovare la sua struttura economica e sociale, in un contesto nel quale l'economia, se solo si pensa all'energia e alla mobilità, può diventare meno dipendente dal sistema dei combustibili fossili per la sua crescita, mentre cresce la richiesta di urgente attenzione all'ambiente e mentre le disuguaglianze producono una domanda nuova di regolazione sociale. In ogni caso, a sistema istituzionale e a modello economico vigenti, la crescita europea non appare sufficientemente vigorosa da trainare da sola il dato del nostro Paese. La condizione attuale è pertanto quella di una ripresa, ma che deve essere però sostenuta e rafforzata. L'Italia registra dati migliori del previsto, tanto che il Governo propone un aggiornamento in aumento del <PARTY>L, confermato anche dai rapporti intermedi di OCSE e Fondo monetario. Crescono i consumi, crescono le importazioni più delle esportazioni, crescono in alcuni settori gli investimenti fissi, crescono la fiducia delle famiglie e la produzione industriale. Sono questi gli indicatori che consentono al Governo di innalzare, anche per il biennio 2017-18, le previsioni sul <PARTY>L ad un tendenziale di crescita dell'1,3 per cento. I dati sull'occupazione confermano un trend positivo. Aumenta di 103.000 unità il numero degli occupati nel secondo trimestre e, se aumentano anche i disoccupati, questo avviene in un contesto in cui diminuiscono dello 0,4 per cento gli inoccupati, cioè coloro che hanno rinunciato alla ricerca di un'occupazione e che, secondo l'ISTAT, raggiungono oggi un dato inferiore a quello del 1993. In questo contesto internazionale di raffreddamento della crescita mondiale e di modesta ripresa in Europa, il Governo valuta come necessario rafforzare i positivi segnali che provengono dalla nostra economia e consolidarli nel prossimo triennio, con alcune scelte sulle quali possono esserci differenti valutazioni, ma con un approccio di politica economica, avviato nel 2015 e confermato nel 2016, che costituisce un elemento di discontinuità rispetto al passato. La scelta, di fronte ad un debito pubblico imponente, non è la ricerca del suo abbattimento attraverso politiche di austerità, ma con un più ampio programma di aggressione del debito tramite stimoli alla crescita della ricchezza. Solo con la crescita del <PARTY>L, sostenuta con politiche pubbliche e anche attraverso il rinvio temporaneo del pareggio di bilancio e dell'obiettivo di medio termine, quindi con un maggior ricorso all'indebitamento, è possibile modificare il trend involutivo, aumentare la ricchezza e ottenere così le risorse per un abbattimento strutturale degli squilibri macroeconomici. È in tal senso, quindi, che deve essere utilizzato il maggior margine di flessibilità concesso dalla Commissione europea nel percorso di aggiustamento imposto dai vincoli di bilancio comunitari ed è in questa direzione che tutte le forze politiche presenti nel Parlamento indicavano la strada per lo sviluppo, ponendo fine a manovre finalizzate all'austerità senza crescita. Se su questo si è largamente d'accordo, è forse sugli strumenti concreti e sugli effetti di stimolo alla crescita che si devono concentrare le scelte e il confronto politico. Ora, la Nota di aggiornamento al DEF si occupa degli elementi di contesto e delle scelte strategiche, ma è la legge di stabilità che diventa lo strumento di adozione delle concrete misure attuative ed è su queste che si devono concentrare le scelte di Governo e Parlamento. Le scelte sono state in parte anticipate e tra queste è fondamentale, oltre che largamente condivisa, l'eliminazione delle clausole di salvaguardia previste a legislazione vigente, la cui attuazione produrrebbe effetti negativi sui consumi. Peraltro questo è l'unico strumento attraverso il quale scende anche la pressione fiscale, che a legislazione vigente - lo dico perché c'è stato un dibattito in Commissione bilancio - salirebbe di un punto in tre anni, mentre, attraverso l'abbattimento delle clausole di salvaguardia e l'impatto del provvedimento del bonus di 80 euro, scende al 42,6 per cento nel 2016, con ulteriori riduzioni negli anni successivi. L'eliminazione delle clausole di salvaguardia, per un valore di oltre 16 milioni di euro, la soppressione di tributi e la prevista proroga di incentivi fiscali sono coperti da risparmi di spesa e dalle clausole di flessibilità per le riforme e per gli investimenti strutturali dello 0,8 per cento richiesti dalla Commissione. Oltre all'eliminazione delle clausole di salvaguardia, il Governo si propone di proseguire nell'opera di riduzione di costi della struttura della pubblica amministrazione; ma, e in più parti ne viene evidenziata la volontà, intende adottare interventi di politica fiscale favorevoli alla crescita, che comportino un alleggerimento del carico tributario su famiglie e imprese. Questi interventi, che sono da tradurre in misure puntuali nella legge di stabilità, riguarderebbero, come anticipato dal Governo in sede di dibattito in Commissione, innanzitutto la cancellazione delle imposte sulla prima casa, di alcune imposte sulle imprese, dell'IMU agricola e sui macchinari, oltre alla conferma di alcuni provvedimenti già previsti nella legge di stabilità 2015, come i bonus sulle assunzioni, anche se probabilmente ridimensionati, e gli ecobonus che hanno contribuito al mantenimento del sistema produttivo dell'edilizia, stimolando in parte l'evoluzione tecnologica. Gli effetti finanziari determinati dalle misure di stimolo fiscale sarebbero in parte controbilanciati da risparmi di spesa finalizzati ad aumentare l'efficienza del settore pubblico, proseguendo la revisione della spesa nel 2016 e negli anni seguenti, che assicura gran parte della copertura dei tagli d'imposta. In questo senso, considerando che la riduzione della spesa limita l'impatto favorevole sulla crescita, determinato dalla cancellazione delle clausole di salvaguardia, la Nota ritiene che l'adozione di un profilo più graduale di tali tagli faccia sì che gli impatti depressivi sul <PARTY>L siano inferiori rispetto a quanto stimato in sede di elaborazione del DEF. Anche su questa base, per l'esigenza di proseguire senza effetti negativi nelle politiche di riduzione del perimetro pubblico, vengono giustificati la modifica dell'obbiettivo di medio termine e lo spostamento al 2018 del pareggio strutturale di bilancio. Concludo il mio intervento, segnalando alcune criticità, emerse in audizone, su cui il Governo ha già comunicato, nel corso del dibattito, che sta lavorando. Ritengo però utile rappresentarle, anche per l'autorevolezza della fonte: si tratta di tre criticità. Come detto, tra gli interventi previsti nella legge di stabilità per il 2016 rientrano le misure in favore delle famiglie. Su questo tema la Banca d'Italia ha sottolineato che le frequenti modifiche alla fiscalità immobiliare degli ultimi anni potrebbero indurre le famiglie a non reputare lo sgravio ora programmato come permanente. Si tratta certamente di un aspetto che va valutato, come va valutato l'impatto sull'efficienza del sistema della finanza locale e sui servizi erogati dagli enti locali, a partire dalla lotta all'evasione fiscale, anche in sede locale, che può essere realizzata solo in presenza di una stabilità delle norme, che negli ultimi anni è assolutamente mancata, ma sulla quale il Governo ha già manifestato l'intenzione di assumere una direzione certa e di confermarla. Nella stessa direzione vanno certamente tenute in considerazione le osservazioni formulate dalla Commissione europea, circa il maggior effetto di stimolo alla crescita di misure fiscali su impresa e lavoro rispetto ad altre, segnalando come sensibile non solo il contenuto delle misure da adottare, ma anche la sequenza della loro attuazione. Anche su questo il Governo ha segnalato la volontà, di cui ovviamente aspettiamo la conferma, di confermare un'attenzione alla sequenza. In secondo luogo occorre mantenere la massima attenzione alla prosecuzione del processo di spending review, che appare strategico non solo per le grandezze di finanza pubblica, ma, in particolare, per la credibilità, sul piano sovranazionale, della politica economica messa in atto dal Governo. La riduzione del perimetro pubblico, in presenza di una spesa già compressa a previdenza, sanità e personale non costituisce probabilmente quell'obiettivo quantitativo per il quale si suscita spesso il clamore dell'opinione pubblica, generalizzando esempi negativi spesso singoli, ma rappresenta certamente un elemento di credibilità istituzionale indispensabile per mantenere intatta la fiducia dei cittadini sulla qualità dell'intervento del Governo e del Parlamento. Infine, altrettanta sensibilità va posta nella direzione di misure che possano sostenere la ripresa del Mezzogiorno, certamente attraverso interventi straordinari e una tantum, ma con la consapevolezza che il recupero del divario di quelle Regioni richiede un'attenzione costante, che si realizza soltanto attraverso investimenti strutturali, la rimozione dei vincoli e dei limiti economici e sociali presenti e, soprattutto, un quadro stabile nel tempo, sia sui piano legislativo che su quello amministrativo. Il continuo mutare, infatti, di questi riferimenti, che devono essere invece una cornice stabile di intervento e valutazione da parte dello Stato, anche delle pubbliche amministrazioni locali, può costituire fondamentale elemento, perché il sistema delle imprese, anche con gli interventi posti in essere in questo periodo, possa porre l'attenzione necessaria e irrimandabile al Mezzogiorno.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.6487109661102295, 0.3512890040874481]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, oggi, in quest'Aula, la maggioranza vorrebbe mandare in soffitta la Costituzione che ha rappresentato l'ossatura e l'armatura della nostra Repubblica, che ha assicurato il contrappeso dei poteri dello Stato garantendo ai cittadini una vera democrazia, che ha permesso alle nostre istituzioni di adeguarsi, forse non sempre perfettamente, alle necessità contemporanee. Un'opera che reca le firme di statisti come De Gasperi, Saragat, Calamandrei e Togliatti che oggi, disgraziatamente, potrebbe cedere il passo a questo obbrobrio istituzionale che di principi democratici ha davvero ben poco. <p> Non discuto la necessità di cambiare le regole per garantire uno Stato veramente più efficiente per il bene del Paese. <p> Certamente si devono razionalizzare i processi legislativi e si devono migliorare i meccanismi che favoriscono la governabilità del Paese. Si deve anche e soprattutto definire i limiti e le competenze di Stato e Regioni. <p> Proprio per queste ragioni avevo avallato il progetto di riforma, convinto che per un cambiamento così importante fosse necessario garantire il più ampio coinvolgimento dell'arco parlamentare, nel pieno rispetto dello spirito costituente. Un concetto semplice, ben chiaro a tutti, ma purtroppo non condiviso dal Governo e dalla sua maggioranza di cui è espressione che in questi mesi ha voluto una continua dimostrazione di forza nei confronti di un Parlamento ormai ridotto a semplice scribacchino dell'Esecutivo, costantemente umiliato e imbavagliato, destituito del suo stesso potere legislativo. Umiliazioni a cui ancora oggi siamo sottoposti, costretti ad una discussione contingentata; uno sfregio all'autorevolezza dell'Assemblea e alla libertà dei suoi componenti. <p> Con la scusa dell'approvazione in tempi stretti non si vuole permettere quel necessario dibattito che potrebbe smuovere le coscienze e formare un'opinione, magari diversa, da quell'uomo solo al comando. Non si deve, quindi, correre per ragioni di urgenza, ma piuttosto per il timore che la democrazia, quella che la nostra attuale Costituzione garantisce, possa sopraffare quell'autoritarismo previsto dalla nuova riforma ma oggi de facto già attuata dal Governo. Un'imposizione frutto della megalomania di questa maggioranza, più attenta a rincorrere la sensazionalità della notizia e di un tweet di tendenza che alla realizzazione di scelte politiche assennate. Nulla di nuovo. L'intero percorso di questo provvedimento è costellato di simili oltraggi: dalla sostituzione in Commissione di alcuni colleghi di maggioranza non in linea con il pensiero unico imposto dalla dirigenza del <PARTY>, alle modifiche del testo, volute sempre dalla dirigenza del <PARTY>, per finire alla calendarizzazione forzata della settimana scorsa, imposta ancora una volta dalla dirigenza del <PARTY>. E lasciatemi dire che si potrebbe sostituire al termine «dirigenza» quello di «dirigente», che sarebbe forse più appropriato. Una tendenza che non potrà che aggravarsi, stanti le modifiche costituzionali previste da questa riforma, a cominciare dalla riduzione del Senato a semplice poltronificio di rappresentanti di Regioni e autonomie. Avrà solo funzioni secondarie di controllo, senza mai contribuire al processo legislativo, quando invece la maggioranza del mondo occidentale conserva un sistema bicamerale quale massima garanzia di democrazia per i cittadini. Umiliare così il Senato non ha neanche una valenza economica, perché il misero risparmio verrà compensato con ulteriori costi in capo alle Regioni (e sempre di soldi pubblici si parla). Il depotenziamento del Senato fa sì che tutte le competenze legislative saranno in capo ad una sola Camera. Grazie al combinato disposto tra riforma costituzionale e legge elettorale, per effetto dello spropositato premio di maggioranza, il partito che vincerà le prossime elezioni, pur non rappresentando la maggioranza degli italiani, avrà il controllo della Camera dei deputati, eleggerà da solo il Presidente della Repubblica, accorderà da solo la fiducia al Governo e al Presidente del Consiglio, nominerà da solo i Presidenti di tutte le Authority e direttamente e indirettamente controllerà da solo la maggioranza dei componenti della Corte costituzionale e del Consiglio superiore della magistratura. È la fine di quel check and balance su cui si fonda la democrazia. Potere legislativo, potere esecutivo, potere giudiziario nelle mani di un solo partito: è la fine della libertà. Alla luce di tutto ciò, mi chiedo ancora una volta dove sia finita quella fiamma costituzionale che ardeva nelle parole del presidente Mattarella quando, il 20 ottobre 2005, in veste di deputato, si scagliò contro la riforma del Governo Berlusconi che, contrariamente alla proposta ora in discussione, oltre a garantire la governabilità, prevedeva anche indispensabili meccanismi di equilibrio istituzionale. Proprio ora che rappresenta la massima autorità garante della Costituzione, perché, presidente Mattarella, tace davanti ad un simile attacco alle nostre libertà? Ebbene ad ella e ai colleghi di maggioranza, effettiva ed in qualche modo allargata, vorrei ricordare le parole pronunciate da Don Sturzo proprio in questo Senato il 27 giugno 1957: «La Costituzione è il fondamento della Repubblica.

Signora Presidente, signora Ministro, signor Sottosegretario, onorevoli colleghi, finalmente dopo anni di tagli all'istruzione c'è un decreto, oggi, che restituisce risorse e ripara i danni fatti negli anni al sistema di istruzione. Ho sentito dagli interventi in discussione generale e in alcune dichiarazioni di voto che c'è chi chiedeva un provvedimento di più ampio respiro. Ma, voglio ricordarlo, il compito di questo Governo di servizio al Paese è quello di ricostruire l'Italia, tirandola fuori dal pantano, restituendole credibilità e inserendola pienamente tra i Paesi motore di sviluppo dell'Europa unita. Ricostruire la scuola insieme, tra forze politiche diverse, rispondendo ai bisogni più urgenti penso sia un bene per l'Italia, perché l'istruzione e la scuola possano essere d'ora in poi terreno di confronto e non di scontro politico, restituendo prestigio e autorevolezza, sostenendo una delle più alte istituzioni democratiche del Paese: la scuola. Se davvero vogliamo educare i cittadini europei all'altezza della sfida dobbiamo alzare i livelli di apprendimento e di competenza dei nostri ragazzi, dimezzare entro il 2020 il tasso di dispersione scolastica e raddoppiare il numero di laureati. Il vantaggio competitivo del nostro Paese, che non ha giacimenti di materie prime e non ha grandi estensioni, sono le teste ben fatte dei nostri figli: il capitale umano sul quale converrebbe davvero investire di più per avere rendimenti certi. <p> (ore 13,34) ( Segue PUGLISI). Il decreto fa esattamente questa scelta, con una opzione in più però, quella di tornare a sostenere i capaci e meritevoli e privi di mezzi che, come chiede la nostra Costituzione, debbono poter raggiungere i più alti gradi di istruzione. Nel tempo della crisi che colpisce le famiglie duramente, il rischio molto concreto è che questo principio costituzionale venga disatteso. Ancora oggi troppi ragazzi e ragazze meritevoli, che hanno diritto a ricevere una borsa di studio, debbono abbandonare gli studi perché non possono permettersi lo studio, che non dovrebbe essere considerato un lusso, ma un diritto di tutti. Ministra, in questi mesi del suo mandato per noi ha seguito la strada giusta, ricostruendo un clima innanzitutto di fiducia nella scuola. In questo decreto non c'è una riforma epocale (e meno male, di riforme epocali contraddittorie rischia di morire la scuola!), ma ci sono importanti innovazioni che le autonomie scolastiche, sostenute dagli enti locali, possono utilizzare per migliorare la qualità dell'offerta formativa. Questo decreto-legge compie alcune scelte decise, che voglio ricordare. Si mette mano alla grande emergenza nazionale che si chiama edilizia scolastica, attivando un miliardo di euro (tra tutti i decreti che abbiamo approvato da quando si è insediato il Governo), attivando ora dei mutui da mettere a disposizione degli enti locali e allentando il Patto di stabilità per coloro che investono per mettere in sicurezza le scuole o ne edificano di nuove. Il decreto-legge dichiara guerra alla dispersione scolastica, percorrendo le strade tracciate dall'OCSE, puntando sul «tempo scuola» e su scuole aperte di pomeriggio, soprattutto nelle aree a maggior rischio di dispersione. Si torna ad investire nella formazione in servizio degli insegnanti (erano molti anni che non vedevamo un euro stanziato in questa direzione) per aiutarli a rinnovare la didattica, per catturare l'attenzione e accendere la passione per la conoscenza in una generazione di studenti che ha sì a disposizione una grande massa di informazioni, ma che spesso fatica ad organizzarla in un sapere critico e compiuto, prevedendo risorse per l'innovazione tecnologica delle scuole e puntando sulla diffusione del wi ‑ fi nelle aule scolastiche. Voglio ricordare a tal proposito che solo il 7 per cento delle aule scolastiche oggi è connesso ad Internet. Per la prima volta si rendono disponibili risorse per un sistema di welfare studentesco (si tratta di una vera e propria novità), mettendo 15 milioni di euro a disposizione delle Regioni per gli studenti in situazioni di svantaggio, per il trasporto scolastico, per agevolare l'acquisto dei libri di testo per le famiglie in difficoltà e per promuovere il comodato d'uso attraverso le reti di scuole. Gli studenti con disabilità avranno finalmente diritto di godere della continuità didattica, grazie al piano di stabilizzazione di quasi 27.000 insegnanti di sostegno: verranno così coperti in modo stabile 90.000 posti disponibili. Il nostro primo pensiero deve essere infatti quello di sostenere nello studio chi parte da situazioni di svantaggio. Ma sul versante del personale c'è di più: ci sono le correzioni necessarie agli errori della spending review del 2012, e così, invece di licenziare i 3.500 precari delle segreterie scolastiche, queste persone, che lavorano con dedizione e competenza, verranno stabilizzate in tre anni; c'è inoltre la restituzione di dignità agli insegnanti inidonei, che potranno continuare a tenere aperte le biblioteche scolastiche o a collaborare per tenere aperte le scuole di pomeriggio. Soprattutto, questo decreto-legge prevede, tra il 2014 e il 2016, attraverso una sessione negoziale con i sindacati, la copertura di tutti i posti vacanti e disponibili: così il tanto agognato organico funzionale diventerà finalmente una realtà. Un'altra norma del decreto-legge che non è stata valorizzata abbastanza in questo dibattito è quella che finalmente dispone il rinnovo del permesso di soggiorno per motivi di studio e di formazione per l'intera durata del corso, e non più di anno in anno. È un passo importante di civiltà e di accoglienza nel nostro Paese che finalmente compiamo. Per ciò che riguarda l'accesso alle scuole specialistiche dei medici c'è la positiva innovazione del concorso nazionale, che favorirà il riconoscimento del merito dei giovani medici. Ringraziamo il Governo per aver accolto l'ordine del giorno sull'equiparazione della durata dei corsi a quella dell'Europa, che contiene le importanti raccomandazioni della Commissione sanità, per garantire ai medici in formazione specialistica, nella fase di transizione, la qualità formativa e la graduazione dell'effetto della riforma, e per definire criteri equi di accesso, con una valutazione estesa alle attività professionali svolte e opportunamente documentate. Per ciò che riguarda l'istruzione universitaria, è positivo il finanziamento di 100 milioni di euro per il diritto allo studio, previsto in modo stabile, però, come ho detto in precedenza, sappiamo che sono tanti, nel tempo della crisi, gli studenti che avrebbero diritto a ricevere una borsa di studio e non la ricevono a causa dell'esiguità delle risorse. È uno schiaffo alla dignità che diamo a questi ragazzi e ragazze meritevoli e privi di mezzi che non possiamo più tollerare. È per questo, signor Ministro, che saremo al suo fianco nella battaglia, in occasione dell'esame del disegno di legge di stabilità, per trovare ulteriori risorse per il diritto allo studio, per sbloccare definitivamente il turnover nelle università, per promuovere un'iniezione di energie fresche di giovani docenti e per rivedere i criteri di valutazione per il finanziamento degli atenei, come lei ha detto prima nella replica. Occorrono criteri di valutazione per il finanziamento degli atenei che promuovano davvero, in tutto il Paese (tanto nel Centro-Nord, quanto nel Centro-Sud), atenei ed enti di ricerca di qualità, ma occorre altresì che questa qualità abbia al centro la qualità soprattutto della formazione degli studenti: sono loro il futuro del Paese. Noi vogliamo promuovere una diversa qualità della crescita, che sappia far dialogare ricerca e sviluppo industriale. Ci impegneremo con lei per trovare risorse, non solo per la ricerca industriale, ma anche per rifinanziare la ricerca di base. Dobbiamo farlo. Continui quindi con tenacia, signor Ministro, in questa giusta direzione di marcia, ad esigere dal Ministero dell'economia e delle finanze le risorse che servono, perché è solo investendo sulla scuola, sull'università e sulla ricerca che potremo aiutare questo Paese a superare i profondi divari territoriali che lo attraversano; solo investendo nella conoscenza potremo far ripartire questa Italia. Con il benaltrismo, che ho sentito purtroppo qui dentro, non si stabilizzano i precari, non si erogano borse di studio, non si migliorano le condizioni dell'edilizia scolastica e non si combatte la dispersione degli studenti. Il vero riformismo è fatto di passi avanti concreti, come quelli contenuti in questo decreto.

L'abolizione delle Province non risolverà i mali della politica italiana. Ho già manifestato il mio pensiero in passato, anche perché essendo stato Presidente di Provincia conosco la questione da vicino. Il provvedimento in esame è un provvedimento sbagliato nel merito e nel metodo. Delle Province difendo il ruolo e la funzione, non solo come un baluardo di identità, ma anche come veicolo per offrire risposte in tempi celeri alle esigenze dei cittadini. La soppressione di tali enti o la trasformazione in enti di secondo livello è un atto non solo incostituzionale, dal momento che va a modificare drasticamente l'organizzazione dello Stato sancita dalla Costituzione, ma antidemocratico, antistorico ed antisociale. Le Province storicamente svolgono un ruolo importante al servizio della collettività. Come dicevo, da Presidente della Provincia sono stato testimone diretto del ruolo, dell'importanza e dei grandi risultati che si possono raggiungere con amministrazioni oculate e attente al sociale, anche in campi non di specifica competenza. È vero: la congiuntura economica che stiamo attraversando è quella che è, ma dare un colpo di spugna a ciò che oggi esiste e funziona, senza sapere cosa accadrà in futuro, appare sempre di più un salto nel vuoto. La demagogia, come al solito, la fa da padrona. Le Province, insieme ai Comuni, sono gli enti cui è affidata la cura delle comunità locali, luoghi privilegiati di partecipazione e di rappresentanza democratica delle istanze popolari. Le stesse Province non possono essere considerate il capro espiatorio dei mali della Repubblica, per la risoluzione dei problemi dei costi della politica. È evidente l'utilità di un livello di governo intermedio di programmazione e di indirizzo. Come spesso accade, viene fatto un annuncio senza che si conoscano concretamente quelle che saranno le modalità attuative. Adesso ci sono le Province, domani nasceranno i superComuni, pare con nuovi organismi da eleggere e nuove competenze da ridistribuire. Si deve cambiare tutto affinché nulla cambi realmente, con gli annunciati risparmi che sono tutti da verificare. Ogni territorio ha le sue caratteristiche precise e le sue peculiarità. Dove esistono aree metropolitane estese, come nelle grandi città, abolire le Province può avere una ragione, ma in territori diversi per vocazione e caratteristiche, come è per la gran parte d'Italia, tutto ciò appare demagogico e pericoloso e, soprattutto, va nella direzione opposta rispetto a ciò che chiedono i cittadini e le imprese. Chi lavora ha bisogno di riferimenti, di coordinamento delle azione. Questo ruolo è stato svolto in modo egregio dalle Province fino a questo momento, rappresentando una vera solidarietà per le imprese e per i cittadini. Pensare ad un percorso lungo che porti la concertazione fino alla Regione per problemi contingenti appare una strada pericolosa, in un momento come questo in cui le risposte devono essere sempre più rapide ed immediate. Anche una ricerca del CENSIS, istituto di ricerca socioeconomica, sostiene che le Province sono istituzioni più adeguate per dare identità e governo all'area vasta. Per fare riferimento alla Provincia cui appartengo, la Provincia di Avellino, immaginate la nostra agricoltura gestita un domani solamente dalla Regione Campania. Il trasporto pubblico, i centri per l'impiego, l'ambiente sono competenze che difficilmente potranno essere trasferite tout court alle Regioni o ai Comuni, che non avrebbero neanche l'organizzazione sufficiente a gestirle. A dire il vero io abolirei le Regioni e lascerei le Province. Il concetto di Regione, a volte, è troppo lato, nel senso che vi sono grandi Regioni con problemi e caratteristiche del territorio molto diversi tra loro. Ci sono Regioni, ad esempio il Veneto, che vanno da richieste di strutture per turismo di mare a provvedimenti speciali per il pericolo di valanghe in montagna. Un solo ente non può conciliare tutto. L'Italia ha realmente bisogno di ridurre gli sprechi, ma non si può consentire che da questa esigenza ne derivi uno scempio costituzionale utile solo per gli slogan elettorali e per le prime pagine dei giornali. Se l'obiettivo del Governo è ridurre i costi, è bene ricordare che il costo delle Province equivale a poco più dell'1 per cento della spesa pubblica nazionale e che, oltretutto, questo provvedimento cancellerebbe di fatto solo le spese della rappresentanza politica, quantificabili in circa 200 milioni di euro l'anno. Rimarrebbero invariati i costi del personale, che comunque sarà redistribuito tra uffici regionali e comunali. A tutto questo si aggiunge un altro dato, non economico ma di pari rilevanza: cancellare un presidio di democrazia, cancellare un livello di rappresentanza, cancellare un riferimento territoriale per i cittadini significa essere sordi al bisogno di ascolto che arriva dalle comunità. Tutto ciò non fa che dare ancora minori certezze alle aziende e a chi lavora, togliendo punti di riferimento. Tale provvedimento produrrà un vuoto amministrativo e istituzionale, e questo è un costo per i cittadini e le imprese. In un momento storico in cui la politica è sempre più in mano ai nominati si sceglie di eliminare uno degli ultimi, ormai pochi, baluardi democratici rimasti a sostegno della macchina amministrativa del nostro Paese. Per questo c'è la necessità della conferma dell'elezione del Presidente del Consiglio provinciale, eventualmente considerando anche le cariche a titolo strettamente gratuito. È paradossale che si parli di abolizione delle Province e non si intervenga su consorzi, enti parco, comunità montane. Occorre che gli amministratori, con il sostegno della società civile, si mettano insieme per rilanciare sul tavolo della politica le reali esigenze delle comunità. Per far sì che ciò avvenga è indispensabile ripartire dall'ascolto, dalle vocazioni dei territori, dai prodotti locali. Per tanti motivi è bene che la titolarità di tante azioni sia affidata, come già detto, a istituzioni elette e controllate dai cittadini che guardano all'intero territorio di destinazione. Per concludere, signor Presidente, signori del Governo, ritengo necessarie una rivisitazione e riorganizzazione dell'ente intermedio, anche riducendo il numero di consiglieri e di componenti della Giunta, ma con l'elezione diretta, come dicevo prima, del Presidente e del Consiglio provinciale, anche senza alcuna retribuzione. È sicuramente auspicabile il mantenimento di certe funzioni, con i dovuti correttivi da apportare, come del resto deve essere rivisto tutto l'apparato della pubblica amministrazione. In questo momento, è concreto il rischio di trovarsi ingannati da un clima demagogico che vede nelle Province il capro espiatorio da colpire per soddisfare un'opinione pubblica che chiede un apparato statale più efficiente, meno burocratico e soprattutto meno costoso. Si tratta di una richiesta legittima, cui la politica è chiamata a dare risposte, senza però illudere i cittadini con palliativi inutili destinati, in futuro, a rivelarsi peggiori del male. L'opinione pubblica deve essere ben informata, perché - sono sicuro - la strada su cui si è incamminato il Governo porterà a compiere errori che si riveleranno drammatici per le nostre comunità. Concludo, signor Presidente, auspicando che queste considerazioni possano far riflettere il Governo per evitare pentimenti postumi che poi non serviranno a nulla.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5459290742874146, 0.45407095551490784]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> IANNONE (<PARTY>).

Tanta fiducia nel Palazzo, pochissima nella nostra Nazione: è una vera e propria emergenza democratica quella che conosciamo, perché non c\\'è la possibilità reale e concreta di dare contributi positivi su provvedimenti come questi che riguardano la vita di migliaia di persone che hanno investito, scommesso e svolgono nell\\'ambito della nostra società ruoli importantissimi come formatori dei cittadini del futuro. Questo provvedimento per noi, che da sempre siamo per la stabilizzazione dei precari, è pensato male e scritto peggio. È stato annunciato come un salva-precari ma a noi sembra che sia più un \"ammazza- precari\", un provvedimento che discrimina e per questo abbiamo presentato una pregiudiziale di costituzionalità illustrata dal nostro capogruppo Luca Ciriani, perché riteniamo emblematica la questione che riguarda gli insegnanti che hanno prestato servizio nelle scuole paritarie e che vengono clamorosamente esclusi dalla possibilità di partecipare al concorso. La nostra attività emendativa era finalizzata proprio a migliorare il provvedimento e a dare delle risposte ad ampi settori che si troveranno sostanzialmente fuori dal mondo della scuola, a dare contributi che potessero risolvere e \"mettere delle toppe\". Faccio riferimento esplicito alla questione incredibile dei diplomati magistrali che non trovano nessuna soluzione e continuano a restare in questo girone dantesco del precariato; faccio riferimento alla vicenda dei dirigenti scolastici che sono stati costretti a ricorrere alla magistratura per far valere i propri diritti; faccio riferimento agli insegnanti di religione cattolica che continuano ad essere trattati come figli di un dio minore: aspettano da anni la possibilità di essere stabilizzati e ancora una volta non viene loro data una risposta che possa assicurare una soddisfacente possibilità di svolgere in maniera più serena e dignitosa il loro lavoro; faccio riferimento alla vicenda dei DSGA facenti funzione, persone che per tanti anni hanno retto le sorti della scuola italiana, che si sono guadagnati sul campo una dignità ed una professionalità e che verranno sostanzialmente \"cestinati\", prima usati e poi abbandonati. C\\'era l\\'opportunità di riconoscere una dignità ai nostri ricercatori universitari, ma anche su questo abbiamo trovato un\\'assoluta sordità da parte del Governo e della maggioranza.

Il rapporto OCSE di settembre dice chiaramente che la scuola italiana è in grandissima difficoltà e che i nostri insegnanti sono i meno pagati d\\'Europa. Se allora, come tanta retorica dice, si vuole veramente investire sulla scuola e sul futuro della nostra Nazione, si poteva fare semplicemente questo, non bandire un concorso che creerà la nuova guerra dei poveri e che non dà una risposta piena alle esigenze e alle problematiche del precariato italiano. Parliamo di 24.000 posti al cospetto di oltre 170.000 vacanze, quindi parliamo di una misura veramente molto ridotta. Evidentemente, il Governo è preso più da questioni di carattere ideologico.

Quindi fortunatamente, non sarà replicabile lo stress test a cui è stato sottoposto il nostro sistema sanitario in marzo-aprile. Quello che invece manca è un vero sistema di prevenzione pandemica nazionale, sorveglianza, controllo e profilassi internazionale <p> , a cui il Governo ha fatto orecchie da mercante, trasferendo la catena delle responsabilità a livello territoriale, financo al mondo delle imprese e dei comportamenti individuali. <p> Abbiamo avuto modo di proporre in più occasioni un piano antipandemia, che quantomeno oggi dovrebbe arricchirsi delle recentissime esperienze e delle crescenti conoscenze cliniche, farmacologiche e organizzative, ma, in quanto proveniente da un'opposizione sgradita, non viene nemmeno preso in considerazione; mentre invece, con la sua pronta adozione, si andrebbero a risolvere gli innumerevoli vulnus strutturali che hanno contribuito all'acuirsi della crisi economica. Sarebbe sufficiente, per quanto riguarda il versante sanitario, la realizzazione di una centrale nazionale delle emergenze (sul modello CDC), delegando a competenze e conoscenze già presenti presso il Ministero della salute, come il Centro controllo malattie, con una cabina di regia al vertice integrata dall'Istituto superiore di sanità e da una rappresentanza qualificata Stato-Regioni. Qualora si dovesse ripresentare una recrudescenza epidemica (ipotesi tutt'altro che remota), tale cabina di regia potrà dare indicazioni tempestive e prescrittive alla Protezione civile sulle azioni da intraprendere e sugli strumenti da utilizzare. Tutto questo sulla base di un aggiornato piano pandemico di prevenzione e controllo pandemico, che di fatto è una lacuna che avrebbe potuto essere già colmata in sede di conversione del decreto-legge n. 34 del 2020, in modo da escludere qualsivoglia necessità di ricorrere, per la stessa fattispecie, allo stato di emergenza nazionale di cui all'articolo 7, comma 1, lettera c) del decreto legislativo n. 1 del 2018, che non dovrebbe attenere alle emergenze sanitarie, soprattutto e ancor di più in questo caso, posto che si tratterebbe di un déjà vu. Se su qualcosa di inedito e di storicamente unico è giustificabile che eccezionalmente decida il Governo, di una fattispecie non solo già nota, ma oggi qualificabile a bassa criticità, è più che sufficiente che se ne occupi un organismo tecnico e che le prerogative fondamentali sulle libertà costituzionali siano oggetto di attenta salvaguardia, vengano in sostanza salvaguardate dal rischio di possibili arbitrarie distorsioni. Avviandomi alla conclusione, signor Presidente, si continua a disattendere una governance nazionale di controllo e prevenzione pandemica, che è alla base di qualsiasi programma di rinnovo e di adeguamento del sistema sanitario in chiave anti e post-Covid, per un corretto bilanciamento in prevenzione, in medicina territoriale ed ospedaliera, mediante correzioni sulle regole generali di ingaggio e attualizzazione della rete, con investimenti mirati che consentano in futuro di avere maggiori prestazioni con minore spesa. Ciò è a salvaguardia di tutti i livelli essenziali di assistenza (LEA), compresi quelli in discussione, di informazione, educazione, prevenzione, assistenza e cura delle malattie infettive e per l'adoperarsi di quanto è necessario affinché l'eventualità di una nuova ondata pandemica non abbia ulteriori effetti avversi. Emergenze come quella del Covid hanno fatto male, e se non si pone rimedio ne faranno sempre di più, a chi è più fragile, non solo sotto il profilo sanitario e socio-sanitario, ma economico e sociale. Invece che misure assistenzialistiche destinate a esaurirsi improduttivamente, occorre agire da subito in prevenzione pandemica, quale leva fondamentale per il contrasto delle vulnerabilità sociali ed economiche, precondizione del benessere individuale e collettivo e presupposto ineludibile per il superamento dell'emergenza economica che stiamo vivendo\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7199277877807617, 0.28007224202156067]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> GHEDINI Rita (<PARTY>).

Purtroppo nelle Marche la crisi economica è più grave che altrove. Nelle Marche, fino a qualche anno fa, era difficile trovare un lavoratore da inserire nel sistema delle attività produttive, in quanto la disoccupazione era intorno al 2 per cento, sotto la soglia fisiologica. <p> Oggi la situazione è precipitata perché alcuni sedicenti economisti hanno accreditato la tesi che le aziende possono essere spremute a volontà, come si apre un rubinetto dell'acqua, come si utilizza una fontana pubblica dalla quale si può attingere a volontà. <p> In realtà, non si può spremere fuori misura le famiglie e le imprese. L'eccessiva tassazione nel breve periodo produce il collasso dell'economia. Questo è quanto avvenuto nelle Marche dove, per sostenere un sistema sanitario irrazionale, basato sullo sperpero di denaro pubblico, si è fatto ricorso ad una tassazione aggiuntiva che ha massacrato l'intero sistema economico, un tempo fiore all'occhiello della nostra Regione. <p> Va aggiunto che le aziende Merloni hanno attinto a piene mani ai contributi statali e regionali per l'industria per ricerca, innovazione, promozione sui mercati internazionali, delocalizzazione. Sottovoce dico che il presidente Spacca è stato ambasciatore della Merloni nel mondo. <p> La situazione deve far riflettere sull'uso spregiudicato della tassazione ordinaria e aggiuntiva. Le altre aziende stanno anche peggio della Merloni. Tuttavia, ritengo sia necessario avviare un confronto tra azienda, sindacati e Governo per individuare le forme di sostegno necessarie per impedire di mettere in mezzo alla strada migliaia di lavoratori. D'altra parte, non è giusto che siano gli operai e le maestranze a pagare per responsabilità che attengono alla proprietà, alla dirigenza e alla politica regionale. <p> Al riguardo, faccio presente che anch'io ho firmato un'interrogazione in materia, che auspico venga discussa quanto prima.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5757942795753479, 0.4242057502269745]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> ESPOSITO Stefano (<PARTY>).

Lei continui con il suo intervento. DE VECCHIS (<PARTY>). La ringrazio, ma noi non abbiamo interrotto nessuno e non vogliamo essere interrotti. Ripeto che stiamo veramente facendo la rivoluzione del buonsenso <p> , contro coloro che hanno supportato e sopportato la legge Madia, rispetto alla quale i sindacati, silenti, non hanno proferito parola. Oggi la CGIL, con Landini in prima fila, inizia a ventilare uno sciopero in autunno. Ma noi rivedremo, dopo quindici anni, anche il contratto collettivo nazionale dei dipendenti pubblici, cosa che voi non avete fatto. Anzi, al contrario, li avete discriminati, cosa che noi non faremo. <p> Tornando al provvedimento, che a breve diventerà legge dello Stato, il Nucleo della concretezza - come ha detto bene la relatrice Nisini, che ringrazio <p> - ha lo scopo di essere un tutor per le amministrazioni pubbliche e di implementarne l'efficienza. Questa efficienza andrà a favore dei cittadini e, quindi, noi pensiamo ai cittadini. Tra l'altro - apro e chiudo una parentesi - a breve avremo anche un provvedimento sul miglioramento della pubblica amministrazione, con il quale supporteremo ancora di più il disegno di legge concretezza. C'è una cosa che mi lascia perplesso. Signor Ministro, confermerà che sono quasi vent'anni che era bloccato il turnover, che noi oggi sblocchiamo, permettendo un ricambio generazionale e ottenendo così due risultati: lavoro per i giovani e pensionamento per il personale anziano. E qui sì che torniamo a quelle che erano le perplessità del <PARTY>: nuove assunzioni, nuova generazione, digitale e informatizzazione, e quindi miglioramento del lavoro all'interno della pubblica amministrazione. Poi ci sono anche altri provvedimenti: uno è passato inosservato, ma daremo anche delle risposte a quei dipendenti che hanno subito le disposizioni in materia di buoni pasto. Porteremo anche questo miglioramento, ossia la restituzione e la sostituzione dei vecchi buoni pasto, dopo il fallimento della società che li gestiva, che verranno ricollocati, arrecando un guadagno economico alle famiglie e alle aziende. Migliorare la pubblica amministrazione vuol dire anche futuri investimenti da parte delle imprese, perché un'ottima amministrazione pubblica vuol dire anche investimenti e investimento vuol dire anche rilancio economico. Ecco che cosa significa concretezza. Per questi motivi la Lega voterà convintamente a favore del disegno di legge in esame.

Pur nella distanza politica, spunti interessanti sono venuti anche dai senatori dell'opposizione in Aula e in Commissione: dalla vice presidente Pelino, dai senatori Castaldi, Girotto e Consiglio. <p> Veniamo ora ai punti politici. Come la senatrice Lanzillotta, e prima ancora il relatore Marino, e altri poi, anch'io mi chiedo se lo strumento della legge annuale si sia rivelato adatto a promuovere la politica della concorrenza. Azzardo una risposta: no, non si è rivelato adatto. I singoli Ministeri tendono infatti, e non senza ragione, a voler definire essi stessi leggi quadro di riforma nei settori di loro competenza, se e quando si sentono in grado di farlo. Penso, per esempio, alla riforma dei servizi portuali, una delle attività più arretrate del nostro Paese che il Ministero delle infrastrutture già in prima battuta, nella definizione originaria del disegno di legge del Governo, avocò a se medesimo. <p> Del resto la storia ci dice che le decisioni più ambiziose in materia di concorrenza sono venute ben prima del 2009, quando venne deciso l'obbligo della legge annuale. Ricordo le principali: la separazione proprietaria delle infrastrutture di trasporto nell'elettricità e nel gas dall'Enel e dall'ENI per costruire i mercati dell'energia laddove prima si operava in regime di monopolio; e poi, la moltiplicazione delle reti di telecomunicazione sia nel mobile che nel fisso e il relativo unbundling allo scopo di favorire l'ingresso di nuovi operatori e ancora i vincoli agli intrecci tra telecomunicazioni e televisione, l'istituzione delle Autorità indipendenti. La più recente, tra le maggiori, è l'Autorità dei trasporti che si accompagna alla competizione nell'alta velocità ferroviaria. Non possiamo però dimenticare le timidezze. Ci sono state anche quelle. Timidezze sulle concessioni autostradali e sul claw back dei miglioramenti in sede tariffaria. Timidezze sul duopolio RAI-Mediaset che verrà attenuato non dalla lungimiranza del legislatore, ma dall'evoluzione tecnologica del web che fa invecchiare in tempi stretti i vecchi signori dell'informazione e dell'intrattenimento. Sottolineo, come hanno già fatto altri colleghi, tra cui il senatore Gasparri, la debolezza politica dei Governi di fronte alla sistematica elusione fiscale degli over the top che genera gravi distorsioni nella concorrenza in servizi strategici come la distribuzione di beni e servizi, la gestione delle informazioni delle identità personali e la pubblicità; settori nei quali operano altre imprese, spesso italiane, che le imposte le pagano. Mi preoccupa la debolezza dell'Antitrust e dell'Agcom, anche solo nel perimetrare tali questioni. Vedete, è giusto che le autorità indipendenti esercitino un diritto di tribuna verso Governo e Parlamento, ma resta in capo alla politica il diritto e il dovere di criticare e, se del caso, incalzare le Autorità a svolgere meglio il loro lavoro. Il dovere dell' accountability va nei due sensi. Anche a questo scopo le Commissioni finanze e industria del Senato stanno cercando una soluzione sul fronte della web tax che recuperi risorse al fisco italiano e assicuri ai mercati e ai consumatori comportamenti corretti delle imprese sotto il profilo della concorrenza. Mi auguro che il Governo collabori con idee e proposte, adesso e magari in sede di legge di bilancio 2017. Ecco, la volontà politica proconcorrenziale non si realizza perché c'è una legge annuale. O tale volontà si forma perché almeno la maggioranza è convinta che la politica della concorrenza serva, e se ne convince senza indulgere alla retorica, ma facendo i conti, come raccomandava sempre, perfino al PCI di Togliatti, quel grande italiano che fu Raffaele Mattioli; oppure questa volontà non si forma, e allora si litiga, e si fanno le baruffe chiozzotte sulla lobby tua contro la lobby mia, materia sulla quale i relatori hanno pronunciato parole definitive. Ciò detto, non possiamo non lasciare alla prossima legislatura il compito di dare una risposta operativa alla domanda che ci hanno posto la senatrice Lanzillotta e il senatore Marino: il calendario è tiranno. Ma l'Italia, che vuole presentarsi come il Paese delle riforme, non può lasciar passare questa legislatura senza aver preso alcuna decisione in materia di concorrenza. Se è vero che questa legge vale l'uno per cento del <PARTY>L, la si approvi al più presto. Io non sono così ottimista e non credo che abbia questo effetto straordinario, e tuttavia dico: Camera e Senato hanno fatto un lavoro; votiamola qui a Palazzo Madama e chiediamo ai colleghi della Camera di fare altrettanto. Ciò per consentire al Governo di varare al più presto un provvedimento annuale relativo al 2017, che venga approvato in tale anno. Questo ha chiesto la Commissione industria in un suo recente parere, e questo ripeto oggi in Aula. Come il relatore Tomaselli ha avvertito, il tempo non passa invano. Questo disegno di legge avrebbe bisogno di qualche ritocco sulle assicurazioni che è già stato definito. È stato raggiunto un accordo anche con forze di opposizione su limiti antitrust più stringenti all'ingresso del capitale finanziario nelle farmacie (ne ha parlato ieri il senatore Mandelli). Non è solo un accordo: io penso sia un miglioramento. Personalmente, aggiungo che in taluni punti il disegno di legge andrebbe addirittura modificato. Faccio un solo esempio: il superamento della maggior tutela; lo faccio anche a beneficio del Presidente del <PARTY>, che nei giorni scorsi ha scoperto l'argomento. Ebbene, se la maggiore tutela nel servizio elettrico si abolisce senza un tetto antitrust e senza aste con regimi di prezzo cost oriented, rischiamo di cristallizzare in capo all'Enel, e in regime di libertà di prezzo, l'85 per cento dei 23 milioni di clienti che oggi l'Enel e le altre società addette allo scopo servono per conto dell'acquirente unico a prezzi da sempre inferiori a quelli cosiddetti liberi. Questi clienti - vorrei essere chiaro - non sono oggi clienti dell'Enel (cioè dell'ex monopolio) e degli altri soggetti che esercitano il servizio di vendita per conto dell'acquirente unico, ma lo diventeranno domani per inerzia. Per l'Enel, sulla base delle documentazioni aziendali (vedo che non tutti coloro che parlano di tale materia, compresa la persona che ho citato prima, l'hanno studiata) stimo un vantaggio di almeno un miliardo di margine. Questo non mi piace - è evidente - ma per ora rinuncio a insistere per un'immediata modifica. Mi fido del favore con cui il Governo Gentiloni Silveri - in particolare il ministro Calenda - guardano a tale questione e agli impegni che hanno preso, correggendo le impostazioni dei predecessori. Anche in questo caso, come in altri, vedremo il Governo e il Ministro alla prova in occasione del prossimo provvedimento. In questi giorni si è prospettato il ricorso al voto di fiducia, che è stato ripetutamente evocato anche in quest'Aula e sappiamo che verrà richiesto. Una simile soluzione costituirebbe da parte di quest'Assemblea un atto di responsabilità verso il Paese e il Governo che deve potersi giocare la carta della concorrenza in Europa. Tuttavia, lasciatemi dire che, date le circostanze e il lavoro fatto dalla Commissione, dall'Assemblea e segnatamente dai relatori, una simile soluzione costituisce anche un atto di generosità da parte della maggioranza e anche - aggiungo - della stessa opposizione. Si tratta di una generosità - vorrei essere chiaro - che sono sicuro non verrà ripagata da furbizia di segno diverso nel terzo e ultimo passaggio alla Camera dei deputati, allo scopo di impedire poi al Governo il varo della legge per il mercato e la concorrenza per il 2017.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5439476370811462, 0.45605233311653137]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> <PARTY>ROVANO (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, membri del Governo, colleghi senatori, anzitutto vorrei ricordare che il provvedimento in esame è stato definito da qualcuno un centoproroghe, nel senso che non è il solito decreto milleproroghe che viene adottato alla fine dell'anno. Si tratta di un atto eccezionale dovuto a urgenza e necessità impellenti, tali per cui si è deciso di procedere alla proroga proprio in questo momento, prima della pausa estiva, che abbiamo accorciato appositamente nell'interesse dei cittadini italiani. In Commissione affari costituzionali, di cui ho l'onore di far parte, la maggioranza - Lega e <PARTY> - ha fatto un grandissimo lavoro per cercare di portare a termine l'esame del provvedimento. Ringrazio anche i colleghi dell'opposizione per l'assiduità con cui hanno partecipato ai lavori della Commissione, essendo stati partecipi e avendo portato il loro contributo. <p> Il provvedimento in esame è straordinario. Noi abbiamo cercato di migliorare il testo originario, apportando delle modifiche che andassero solo ed esclusivamente nell'interesse dei cittadini, favorendo i piccoli e anche il mondo produttivo e dell'impresa. <p> Non voglio soffermarmi su tutto quello che è stato fatto in questo decreto-legge, anche grazie agli emendamenti che abbiamo portato alla vostra attenzione, perché se ne è discusso a lungo. Voglio, però, ricordare che alcuni temi non sono stati trattati non perché non siano importanti o all'attenzione del Governo e del Parlamento, ma perché non è questo il momento di discuterne. <p> Ci sono questioni molto importanti per il nostro Paese che necessitano non di interventi estemporanei, ma di revisioni e riforme generali. Mi riferisco in particolare alle Province, visto che è un tema di cui si è molto discusso in quest'Assemblea. Mi fa un po' strano che sia proprio il <PARTY> a parlare di Province e ad arrabbiarsi, perché abbiamo deciso di fare un election day almeno per il 2018 <p> Ricordo che in Commissione è stato proposto alle minoranze di estendere la misura comprendendo anche quei Consigli provinciali che andavano a elezione nel gennaio 2019: ci è stato detto di no. Quindi, la proposta da noi è arrivata, ma è stata bocciata. Quanto alle Province, si può essere d'accordo o meno sul fatto di tenerle, ma il problema grosso è che sono state distrutte prima di essere cancellate. <p> Ricordo che il Ministro dell'interno, proprio qui al Senato, di fronte alle Commissioni affari costituzionali delle due Camere, il 25 luglio scorso ha dichiarato che è necessaria una riforma per garantire a questo ente che esiste di continuare a lavorare per il bene dei territori e dei cittadini. Non è vero, quindi, che non ci siamo interessati alla questione; semplicemente non era questo il momento per farlo. Stesso discorso vale per gli enti locali. Abbiamo esaminato il pacchetto di emendamenti relativi ai Comuni, ma, anche in siffatto caso, salvo qualche impegno da parte del Governo, si è deciso di posticipare la discussione perché non era urgente per il mese di agosto e da qui alla fine dell'anno. Se ne discuterà più avanti. <p> Voglio ricordare anche i provvedimenti importanti adottati con il decreto-legge in esame che riguardano anzitutto le zone colpite dal terremoto, oltre al contributo indispensabile che è stato dato dal Consiglio dei ministri prorogando lo stato di emergenza a Ischia, visto che scadeva proprio ad agosto. Ma sono state altresì previste misure importanti, come quella che garantisce ai bambini di andare a scuola anche nelle classi dove il numero degli alunni non sarebbe sufficiente; sono state date le proroghe per l'adeguamento della normativa antincendio e per le verifiche di vulnerabilità sismica; e ciò avviene nell'immediato per garantire ai bambini di andare a scuola. Per lo stesso motivo è stato deciso di non applicare la sanzione - sottolineo la sanzione - per quei bambini che non hanno presentato la certificazione di vaccinazione. Non è stato abolito l'obbligo di vaccinazione, ma è stata abolita una delle sanzioni per garantire ai bambini da zero a sei anni - così come per i loro compagni dai sei ai sedici anni - di poter andare a scuola per non discriminare i bambini, nel caso i genitori non avessero ancora ottemperato. Anche di ciò si discuterà più avanti e, quindi, trovo molto pretestuose, anche da questo punto di vista, le critiche dell'opposizione. <p> Altro provvedimento molto importante: abbiamo salvato il Gran Premio di Monza, che, per questioni burocratiche, non avrebbe più potuto svolgersi, con conseguente danno non solo all'immagine del Paese ma anche all'economia di interi territori. <p> Abbiamo dato una mano alle televisioni locali, che avrebbero rischiato di lasciare a casa circa 5.000 persone, perché non potevano usufruire dei contributi accordati. Anche in questo caso si è data un'attenzione ai territori, nello specifico all'informazione locale, che è fondamentale e garantisce attenzione ai nostri cittadini, anche con fili diretti, attraverso l'impegno sui nostri territori. <p> Abbiamo previsto diversi interventi per quanto riguarda la scuola. Per esempio, abbiamo esteso all'anno accademico 2018/2019 la possibilità di ricorrere alla graduatoria a esaurimento per l'attribuzione di incarichi di insegnamento nei corsi di alta formazione artistica, musicale e coreutica, e nello stesso tempo di mandare nelle scuole italiane all'estero la selezione degli insegnanti prorogando le graduatorie. In materia di università, abbiamo prorogato al 31 ottobre i termini per le commissioni che stanno procedendo a conferire l'abilitazione scientifica nazionale per i ruoli di professore universitario. In materia di cultura, abbiamo esteso - anche se per l'opposizione non è sufficiente - anche al 2018 il bonus cultura per i diciottenni. Solo misure rivolte ai cittadini, pensate per i cittadini, e non abbiamo finito qui. Abbiamo approvato delle misure rivolte e pensate per i cittadini, e non abbiamo finito. Mi chiedo come sia possibile che le opposizioni pensino che in due mesi dall'insediamento del Governo si possano risolvere tutti i problemi che sono stati causati negli ultimi anni. <p> Ricordo anche l'attenzione particolare rivolta ai nostri territori e alle nostre Regioni. Ad esempio, abbiamo approvato un emendamento nel quale abbiamo ridotto il blocco dell'erogazione degli atti di assegnazione da parte del Ministero dei trasporti rivolti al finanziamento del trasporto pubblico locale. Questo influisce molto sulla vita quotidiana, soprattutto dei nostri cittadini pendolari, ma non solo, e di tutti i ragazzi che vanno a scuola. <p> Abbiamo introdotto diverse innovazioni e dato una mano anche ai cittadini in difficoltà economica, sospendendo la quota capitale dei mutui per le famiglie in difficoltà e abbiamo salvaguardato posti di lavoro - come vi ho detto prima - nei territori grazie alla proroga fatta per quanto riguarda l'emendamento chiamato MOCA, nel quale è interessata una quarantina di città italiane che vivono, attraverso l'artigianato e per l'indotto collegato, sulla produzione di ceramiche artistiche. Si tratta di un altro esempio dei problemi causati dalle normative europee che non tengono conto della peculiarità delle produzioni e delle tipicità del nostro Paese Anche questo è un esempio lampante, perché noi proroghiamo qualcosa che è sbagliato, non per la legge in sé, ma perché deve essere recepito dai Paesi membri in base alle esigenze della produzione locale. Anche in questo caso erano a rischio molti posti di lavoro, il turismo e l'economia di molte città del nostro Paese. <p> Voglio ringraziare ancora una volta - credo sia incredibile - che quest'Assemblea sia qui riunita oggi, un lunedì di agosto. Non so se sia mai successo in passato... <p> VOCE DAL GRUPPO <PARTY>. Sempre. <p> <PARTY>ROVANO (<PARTY>). Sempre? A me dicevano che c'era un mese di ferie, solitamente. BRESSA (<PARTY>).

Per il primo profilo va ricordato come l'esigenza di garanzie per la rappresentanza di genere debba trovare un punto di ricaduta concreto ancora più avanzato nelle vicende sociali del nostro Paese. In questa direzione va, ad esempio, segnalato il risultato conseguito dalla legge n. 120 del 2011 che incentiva la presenza delle donne nei consigli di amministrazione delle società pubbliche e private. <p> È comunque necessario individuare strumenti che valorizzino in modo ancor più significativo la presenza femminile nella società civile. Tuttavia, anche nella più specifica sfera della politica è necessario imprimere un cambiamento, pur dovendosi rilevare che tante colleghe già oggi hanno raggiunto altissimi livelli di responsabilità politica nei quali hanno saputo e sapranno riversare tutta la loro esperienza professionale ed umana. <p> In tema di assemblee elettive va poi ricordata la legge n. 215 del 2012 con la quale sono state introdotte, nelle elezioni per i consigli comunali dei Comuni con più di 5.000 abitanti, sia la doppia preferenza di genere sia una quota di lista in base alla quale, nelle liste dei candidati, nessuno dei due sessi può essere rappresentato in misura superiore ai due terzi. Analoghe soluzioni sono state adottate da alcune Regioni. <p> In questo quadro complessivo il disegno di legge in esame opera sul versante della modalità della rappresentanza nel campo dell'elezione dei rappresentanti italiani al Parlamento europeo, in un momento tuttavia in cui è ben presente a quest'Aula il serrato dibattito che sul tema delle quote di genere si è svolto presso la Camera dei deputati in occasione della modifica della legge elettorale nazionale. <p> A breve, quindi, potremo riprendere questo tema nell'ambito della discussione del provvedimento, che è già stato approvato dalla Camera dei deputati il 12 marzo, approfondendone ulteriormente i diversi profili. Ma la differenza sostanziale tra la discussione che presto affronteremo ed il dibattito che oggi si svolge qui non può sfuggire. Nel primo caso infatti (la legge elettorale nazionale) ci troveremo a confrontarci su un complesso di norme, su una riforma ampia al cui interno trovano spazio specifiche questioni e tra queste quella della rappresentanza di genere. Una riforma ampia che è esaminata anche all'esito della nota sentenza della Corte costituzionale ed in un momento in cui non si profila al nostro orizzonte un immediato ritorno alle urne. Vi è quindi il tempo per poter esaminare il testo elaborato dalla Camera dei deputati con sufficiente serenità e ponderatezza, pur in vista dell'adozione di quelle modifiche che da più parti sono state evocate, anche da autorevoli esponenti del <PARTY>. <p> Dunque, all'esito del lavoro complessivo che Camera e Senato opereranno sulla legge elettorale nazionale, potranno essere tratti gli opportuni stimoli ed indicazioni per adeguatamente valutare la materia oggetto del disegno di legge oggi all'ordine del giorno del Senato. Non è certo un modo per eludere il tema che ora abbiamo dinanzi, al contrario: proprio perché vogliamo approfondirlo adeguatamente, non possiamo prescindere dall'analisi e dalle valutazioni che saranno effettuate con riferimento al testo approvato dalla Camera. <p> Il provvedimento in esame (qui sta la differenza cui prima mi richiamavo) affronta oggi, a raccolta delle firme in corso, un problema che attiene alla formazione delle liste ed al voto di preferenza per l'elezione al Parlamento europeo. Ritengo che a procedimento iniziato non sia possibile procedere a modifiche della legge elettorale per il Parlamento europeo. Ci troviamo, infatti, a poche settimane dalle elezioni e l'introduzione del vincolo previsto dal disegno di legge avverrebbe in una fase ormai troppo avanzata. D'altra parte, sulla questione vi è un'espressa indicazione delle istituzioni dell'Unione europea che raccomanda di non modificare le regole della competizione elettorale nell'anno precedente le elezioni. Pertanto, un differente atteggiamento potrebbe essere assunto laddove il disegno di legge all'ordine del giorno fosse esaminato lontano dalla competizione elettorale a livello europeo. <p> Il rischio che vedo materializzarsi è quello di adottare su uno specifico, anche se rilevante, aspetto del meccanismo di trasformazione dei voti in seggi una soluzione che, avulsa da un contesto generale, può rischiare di condizionare in qualche modo la discussione sul disegno di legge che il 12 marzo scorso, non senza difficoltà, è stato approvato dall'altro ramo del Parlamento. Lasciamo, invece, che il confronto su tale progetto si dispieghi al Senato scevro da condizionamenti ed ispiriamoci alle soluzioni che in quell'ambito saranno operate. <p> Detto questo, circa l'aspetto relativo al coordinamento dei tempi per l'esame dei testi che ad oggi pendono dinanzi al Senato e che, come ho detto, suggerirebbero a mio avviso di non procedere oltre, in questa fase, nell'esame del disegno di legge oggi iscritto all'ordine del giorno dell'Aula, mi soffermerò su taluni aspetti affrontati da tale ultimo disegno di legge. Quanto alle liste, rilevo che è pur vero che l'articolo 51, comma 1, della Costituzione prevede che tutti i cittadini dell'uno e dell'altro sesso possano accedere agli uffici pubblici e alle cariche elettive in condizioni di eguaglianza, secondo i requisiti stabiliti dalla legge, e che a tal fine la Repubblica promuove con appositi provvedimenti le pari opportunità tra donne e uomini, ma la questione da risolvere attiene proprio ai limiti e alle modalità con le quali questi principi si concretizzano negli atti normativi. <p> Da questo punto di vista viene da domandarsi se in questo quadro una disposizione cogente al punto da portare in specifiche ipotesi alla ricusazione della lista sia conforme al dettato costituzionale. Si prevede infatti, tra l'altro, un meccanismo di cancellazione dei nomi dei candidati appartenenti al genere più rappresentato, in modo tale da assicurare il rispetto del principio per cui in ciascuna lista i candidati dello stesso sesso non possono eccedere la metà e che quando, all'esito della cancellazione delle candidature eccedenti, la lista contenga un numero di candidati inferiore al previsto, la lista è ricusata dall'ufficio elettorale circoscrizionale. Mi permetto a questo riguardo di sottolineare che in questo modo è stravolta la volontà di quelle decine di migliaia di elettori che hanno sottoscritto la lista (si tratta di un numero che, ricordo, varia sulla base dell'articolo 12 della legge n. 18 del 1979, da 30.000 a 35.000 elettori). L'alternativa sarebbe quella di dover rifare le liste senza tuttavia poter fruire del tempo legislativamente previsto per la raccolta delle firme, conseguentemente creando un'evidente disparità di trattamento. A questo scopo sarebbe comunque necessaria una norma transitoria che però, come ha segnalato il Governo in Commissione affari costituzionali, presenta profili di irragionevolezza, potendosi determinare proprio quell'effetto discriminatorio tra le liste che partecipano alla competizione elettorale che ho ora evidenziato. <p> Mi rendo conto che si tratta di uno specifico aspetto della normativa oggi al nostro esame, ma gli effetti di questa e le perplessità di ordine costituzionale che si pongono sono, a mio avviso, sintomatiche dell'esigenza di un sostanziale rinvio dell'esame della questione nel senso che ho prima evidenziato. <p> Resto convinto, signor Presidente, che le garanzie per la rappresentanza di genere vadano accompagnate anche con interventi di normazione primaria diretti a favorirla, ma la scelta dei tempi nei quali concretizzare questi interventi non è indifferente per il migliore conseguimento del risultato ed è per questo che, conclusivamente, ribadisco la posizione illustrata auspicando sul disegno di legge una pausa di riflessione.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5848128199577332, 0.41518715023994446]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> DI MAGGIO (<PARTY>).

È inutile scandalizzarsi: in Italia non esiste una grande infrastruttura, sia ferroviaria che autostradale, a cui non siano abbinate delle opere di compensazione. Se vogliamo eliminarle in futuro il Parlamento può sicuramente intervenire, ma fino ad oggi in Italia, proprio per la morfologia del territorio, le opere di compensazione sono state e sono a mio parere indispensabili.

Si tratterà quindi di questioni cruciali, insieme a quelle dell'immigrazione, della Brexit e delle altre richiamate dal Presidente del Consiglio, per il futuro dell'Europa. <p> La strategia per il mercato unico digitale, adottata nel maggio 2015, deve essere infatti progressivamente ma rapidamente implementata con l'obiettivo di migliorare l'accesso ai beni e ai servizi digitali in tutta Europa per i cittadini e per le imprese e per cogliere a pieno il potenziale di crescita dell'economia digitale. <p> Il Governo italiano ha già assunto un ruolo determinante, insieme ad alcuni partner europei, nella volontà di proseguire con decisione in direzione del mercato unico digitale. Contemporaneamente, il Governo italiano è impegnato ad accelerare e rafforzare la marcia per strutturare nel nostro Paese un adeguato ecosistema per l'innovazione digitale. Purtroppo siamo ancora, nonostante gli sforzi compiuti negli ultimi due-tre anni, in una situazione di svantaggio rispetto a molti Paesi dell'Unione. Il rapporto OCSE pubblicato pochi giorni fa colloca il nostro Paese in fondo alla classifica sul grado di avanzamento della trasformazione tecnologica. Non dobbiamo disconoscere questa realtà. Sono convinta che solo a partire dalla consapevolezza dei nostri ritardi possiamo meglio condividere la necessità di continuare un impegno per recuperare il tempo perduto. Il nostro Paese ha accumulato, a partire dall'inizio degli anni 2000, ritardi nella infrastrutturazione della banda larga, nella digitalizzazione della pubblica amministrazione e del nostro apparato produttivo. Ciò ha determinato nel sistema pubblico una minore efficienza nella prestazione dei servizi a cittadini e imprese e nei settori della produzione una diminuita competitività ed una perdita di valore per la nostra economia. Un grave ritardo che abbiamo iniziato a recuperare negli ultimi tre anni, con una inversione di marcia davvero molto decisa, intrapresa prima dal Governo Renzi e poi dal Governo Gentiloni Silveri. Mi riferisco, in particolare, agli investimenti ed alle misure previste dal piano per la banda ultralarga e dal piano Industria 4.0, che stanno dando una spinta straordinaria agli investimenti innovativi, alla digitalizzazione, agli investimenti in ricerca. In questi ultimi anni sono stati fatti molti passi avanti: è cresciuta la consapevolezza dei benefici dell'innovazione e sono state adottate misure incisive per dare un adeguato supporto alle imprese, stimolando collaborazioni con università, enti di ricerca e startup. Non è necessario che mi dilunghi su questo punto, il Governo sa bene ciò che serve al Paese. Sono certa che condividiamo la convinzione che solo attraverso l'investimento nella scienza, nella tecnologia, nella ricerca e nell'innovazione possiamo dare slancio e rafforzare quella ripresa economica che significativi indicatori ci dicono in atto nel nostro Paese. La conferma, non scontata, nella manovra di bilancio per il 2018 della prosecuzione di Industria 4.0, che evolve in Impresa 4.0, il sostegno agli investimenti delle piccole e medie imprese, l'incentivo strutturale per l'occupazione giovanile, l'assunzione di 1.500 ricercatori dimostrano concretamente l'attenzione del Governo su questo fronte. L'innovazione digitale non è certo l'unico elemento, ma è sicuramente un fattore strategico per la crescita. Se però è vero che l'Italia è in ritardo nella sfida del digitale, è pur vero che complessivamente anche l'Unione europea lo è; in questo campo è ancora grande lo spazio di lavoro comune da affrontare. L'Europa è in ritardo, la politica tutta è in ritardo nell'affrontare le enormi questioni poste dalla rivoluzione digitale. Tuttavia, anche a livello europeo, nel 2016 e nel 2017 abbiamo compiuto passi in avanti davvero molto importanti. Mi riferisco alla questione della protezione dei dati, alla portabilità transfrontaliera dei contenuti online e, soprattutto, all'abolizione delle tariffe di roaming e all'accordo sull'accesso gratuito a Internet nei luoghi pubblici. Si tratta di misure molto concrete, che contribuiscono a migliorare la percezione di una Unione europea più vicina alle domande ed alle esigenze dei propri cittadini, in particolare dei giovani. Risposte utili anche a contrastare la falsa percezione, alimentata artatamente dalle forze populiste, di istituzioni e decisioni europee lontane dai problemi della vita reale degli europei. Per il futuro, la strategia dell'Unione si prefigge di espandere ulteriormente l'economia digitale. Secondo uno studio comunitario, il valore economico dei dati passerà in Europa dai 300 miliardi di euro del 2016 ai 739 miliardi di euro nel 2020. Le ultime statistiche comunitarie ci informano inoltre di un aumento esponenziale degli attacchi informatici, aumentati del 300 per cento dal 2015, con l'80 per cento delle imprese europee che hanno subito almeno un incidente cibernetico nel corso dell'ultimo anno. Sono dati che mettono in evidenza, insieme all'urgenza di un quadro normativo adeguato, la necessità del completamento del mercato unico digitale entro il prossimo anno. La transizione all'Europa digitale richiede di attuare precise priorità: infrastrutture e reti di comunicazione di alta qualità; pubbliche amministrazioni e settori pubblici pienamente adeguati all'era digitale; sistemi di istruzione e di formazione altamente qualificanti; maggiori investimenti in ricerca e sviluppo; un approccio comune in materia di sicurezza cibernetica e un aggiornato regime fiscale. Si tratta, insomma, di accompagnare e sostenere in Europa il processo in corso, nel settore pubblico così come in quello privato, perché nel mondo globale restare indietro nell'utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie connesse al digitale significa essere destinati alla irrilevanza. Nell'ambito degli enormi rivolgimenti dati dall'economia digitale emerge fra le questioni cruciali quella della sicurezza e della difesa, del controllo del fenomeno della radicalizzazione. Su questo piano i grandi operatori del web, che detengono a livello globale quantità enormi di dati, possono e devono collaborare con le istituzioni europee. L'attenzione dell'Unione europea rispetto alla sicurezza cibernetica è cresciuta molto, ma ora è il tempo di definire un quadro normativo uniforme. Vorrei, infine, accennare alla questione della web tax, sulla quale pare esserci la volontà di procedere con una proposta legislativa comune, una direttiva, nella primavera del 2018. Essa ha ovviamente ricadute economiche, ma anche un risvolto sul piano dell'equità: non è eticamente accettabile che ci siano imprese che non pagano le tasse, senza tralasciare le distorsioni sul piano della libera concorrenza e della competitività. Insomma, si tratta di applicare anche all'economia digitale quel che vale per qualsiasi altro settore economico, il principio per cui le imprese devono pagare le tasse laddove producono i profitti. Voglio ricordare, a tal proposito, che gli enormi introiti che potrebbero derivare dalla web tax in Europa potrebbero essere utilizzati in modo proficuo per la formazione e la creazione di lavoro per i nostri giovani. Volevo concludere accennando all'importanza dell'integrazione in merito all'ambito digitale, che è una base importante per l'integrazione europea. Non esiste futuro per il nostro Paese senza Unione europea, non può compiersi appieno l'Unione senza una sua piena realizzazione anche sociale e politica. Occorre più Europa, lo abbiamo visto bene, soffrendone le lacune, in occasione del grave dispiegarsi della vicenda catalana. A sessant'anni dalla firma del Trattato di Roma, di cui si è ricordato oggi l'anniversario, che istituì la Comunità economica europea, abbiamo il compito e la responsabilità di saper rinnovare e continuamente aggiornare l'ispirazione che portò i fondatori del progetto europeo a realizzare ciò che ad altri appariva come un sogno irrealizzabile.

Ricordo al presidente Boeri che l'ISTAT in questi giorni ha segnalato la perdita di 51.000 posti di lavoro, una disoccupazione all'11,3 per cento (un dato, secondo me, molto ottimista) e una disoccupazione giovanile al 37 per cento. Basterebbe far rientrare in Italia la metà dei giovani emigrati all'estero negli ultimi cinque anni per motivi molto spesso legati al lavoro. Basterebbero loro per risolvere i problemi. Quindi, presidente Boeri, non si sostituisca al Parlamento in certe scelte politiche, soprattutto in un momento in cui l'approvazione e il dibattito che c'è sullo ius soli sta creando parecchie frizioni sia nelle Aule parlamentari che in tutto il Paese. Già che ci siamo, approfitto per dirle che forse sarebbe meglio analizzare il perché le coppie italiane non fanno figli; forse bisognerebbe capire perché gli asili non funzionano come dovrebbero. Non si può demandare tutto alla scuola, ma anche questa forse non ha la possibilità di offrire ai ragazzi il massimo di ciò che potrebbe dare. Bisognerebbe preoccuparsi del fatto che il 29 per cento degli italiani, pari a circa 17,5 milioni di persone, sono a rischio povertà ed esclusione sociale e al Sud si arriva a circa il 47 per cento. Presidente Boeri, non abbiamo bisogno di nessuno; basterebbe mettere a regime tutti i disoccupati del Paese, richiamare i giovani che hanno rappresentato un costo sociale perché si sono formati in Italia e metteremmo a posto i conti. Se lei è così bravo da riuscire a dare lavoro a 100.000 soggetti che arrivano nel nostro Paese e che costituiscono delle risorse, noi siamo contenti, ma non faccia affermazioni che non le competono, soprattutto in un momento particolare per questo Paese. Abbiamo visto cos'è successo con gli enfant prodige della politica europea. Mi riferisco a Macron. Qualcuno diceva che un Macron al giorno toglie l'immigrato di torno, però questo ha risolto i problemi della Francia in una settimana circa di suo operato e li ha scaricati, come hanno fatto la Germania e l'Austria, sul nostro Paese. Se sono risorse, dovrebbero esserlo per tutta l'Europa; invece, lo diventano solo per noi. Ben venga se il lavoro lo troviamo a tutti questi ragazzi. Io credo, piuttosto, che sarebbe il caso di mettere in condizione i nostri disoccupati di trovare un lavoro. Presidente Boeri, ognuno faccia il suo mestiere.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5601886510848999, 0.4398113489151001]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> DE BERTOLDI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, la ringrazio e chiaramente ringrazio tutti i colleghi. Intervengo con grande senso di responsabilità a nome del Gruppo <PARTY> sulle mozioni che stiamo discutendo. Oggi è il 5 febbraio, una data che si pone - non so se casualmente - a cavallo tra due giornate altrettanto importanti per la nostra memoria storica: il Giorno della Memoria del 27 gennaio e il Giorno del Ricordo del 10 febbraio. Sono due date che ricordano momenti tragici della nostra storia europea; due date che ricordano delle atrocità che vanno certamente al di là della politica e della storia. Momenti che devono ricordare a ciascuno di noi, da sinistra a destra, come l'uomo in troppe occasioni non ha saputo essere all'altezza di quella umanità che dovrebbe invece caratterizzarci. E, quindi, se così è, non posso che accogliere con piacere l'invito che ci è stato rivolto in alcuni interventi che mi hanno preceduto a voler votare trasversalmente e unitariamente sulle mozioni che sono state presentate. Credo, cari colleghi, che <PARTY> abbia dimostrato e dimostri la propria coerenza: infatti noi non abbiamo voluto presentare un'ulteriore mozione sul tema specifico, proprio perché riteniamo, nei fatti, che si debba arrivare a votare una mozione unitaria. Vorremmo invece - e in tal senso rivolgiamo un invito e un auspicio all'Assemblea e alla Presidenza - che ben presto potesse essere posta in discussione una mozione più ampia sull'antisemitismo, come quella che <PARTY> ha depositato fin dallo scorso anno che vuole far sì che di tale fenomeno storico si ragioni e discuta in una dimensione più ampia, valutando i pericoli che purtroppo oggi - e non ieri - riguardano questa situazione. Mi riferisco in particolare all'antiebraismo, che purtroppo pervade oggi non solamente le frange più estreme e reazionarie della destra e della sinistra ma anche - ahimè - quel mondo islamico che oggi viene vissuto come un grave pericolo per l'esistenza stessa di un popolo e anche di un Paese quale Israele. Auspichiamo quindi che ben presto si possa ampliare il ragionamento sul tema. Nel merito, come detto, siamo assolutamente favorevoli. Presidente, riteniamo che riflettere sul giorno della memoria voglia dire riflettere su come tutelare oggi le libertà individuali e l'essere umano, al di là di ogni caratterizzazione di razza, di religione e di ideologia politica. Ben vengano quindi tutte le iniziative che vogliono portare maggiore cultura e conoscenza. Quando si parla di cultura e di conoscenza, si deve parlare di trasversale cultura e conoscenza e ovviamente nessuno deve avere paura di aprire i propri armadi e di fare i conti con il proprio passato. Io lo dico onestamente e fieramente da destra e sono certo che altrettanto si saprà fare anche dall'altra parte politica. Certamente le atrocità non possono avere un colore e vanno condannate a prescindere, da qualunque parte storica, politica o temporale possono essere provenute. Bisogna quindi tutelare il ricordo e rendere consapevoli soprattutto i nostri giovani delle atrocità del passato su popoli che - ahimè - hanno dovuto scontare la cattiveria umana. Mi riferisco ovviamente in primis al popolo ebraico e a quanto successo agli armeni, ai curdi, agli ucraini e ai tanti oppositori politici che nelle varie realtà del nostro mondo, ieri ed oggi, vengono purtroppo discriminati, vessati e uccisi per le proprie idee. Non è un ricordo del passato, ma è una perpetrazione nel presente delle atrocità umane che dobbiamo condannare proprio ricordandoci che la storia è davvero magistra vitae (maestra di vita) o, almeno, lo dovrebbe essere. Non possiamo che fare riferimento, come sintesi politica, alla risoluzione dell'Unione europea che ha condannato ovviamente tutti i totalitarismi e che facendo così vuole condannare, senza barriere e steccati, le atrocità del passato e le situazioni del presente in cui purtroppo si continua a denigrare l'essere umano in quanto uomo e persona. Per quanto riguarda i viaggi della conoscenza, certamente è un bene che si possa apprendere non solamente dai libri di testo. È un bene che utilizzando i sensi di cui la natura ci ha dotato (la vista, il tatto), ma anche le sensazioni e i sentimenti, i nostri giovani possano recarsi nei posti dove si sono consumati questi tragici eventi. Naturalmente il finanziamento e il supporto economico che noi chiediamo, insieme a voi, trasversalmente al Governo perché possano essere attuati questi viaggi, vanno in parallelo con un maggiore interesse complessivo verso il sistema scolastico. Ricordiamoci che non possiamo lavarci la coscienza prendendo solamente una parte: se vogliamo davvero creare dei giovani che rappresentino il futuro democratico di questo Paese dobbiamo investire nella scuola e nelle istituzioni scolastiche. È quindi un appello che rivolgo al Governo in questo senso: ben venga per <PARTY> - e lo ribadisco a voce alta - il sostegno a questi viaggi, ma ben venga, anche e soprattutto, un sostegno a tutte le nostre scuole e istituti formativi. Signor Presidente, c'è una riflessione che voglio fare per chiarire un equivoco sorto negli scorsi mesi, allorquando noi e parte del centrodestra venimmo accusati di non aver applaudito la nostra collega senatrice Liliana Segre. Proprio perché non è questo il momento delle partigianerie e delle parzialità, ci tengo a chiarire che in quel momento il voto di astensione di <PARTY> era legato al fatto che volevamo una Commissione che avesse maggiore valenza antisemita e fosse meno strumentalmente utilizzabile, come abbiamo chiaramente detto, magari per fini di censura. Il voto quindi era specifico sulla Commissione e non aveva assolutamente alcun riferimento alla figura della nostra collega Liliana Segre, alla quale anzi ribadisco qui tutta la nostra vicinanza e il più caloroso e fraterno abbraccio da parte della comunità di <PARTY>. <p> Colgo l'occasione, anche a nome della nostra presidente Giorgia Meloni, per rinnovarle l'invito ad essere presente alla nostra prossima festa nazionale di Atreju. <p> Alla luce di questo chiarimento, concludo davvero ribadendo il voto di <PARTY> a favore alle mozioni, che, a nostro giudizio, dovrebbero ricompattarsi in una mozione unitaria e rappresentare, al di là di ogni steccato, la volontà di una Camera del Parlamento di essere una Camera della libertà e della dignità dell'essere umano.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5477576851844788, 0.45224231481552124]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare. <p> DIVINA (<PARTY>).

È - secondo il mio giudizio - un atto dovuto nei confronti dei tanti giovani che vogliono indossare la divisa. Non lo fanno perché non hanno lavoro, ma innanzitutto perché vogliono dire e giurare alla Patria che loro sono dei servitori dello Stato.

Secondo l'Istituto di ricerca e protezione idrogeologica del CNR, nel Paese dal 1960 ad oggi ci sono stati 1.443 avvenimenti inclementi tra frane, crolli e inondazioni, con 4.122 morti e 2.850 feriti. Di fatto, in Italia, quasi l'82 per cento dei Comuni ha problemi di rischi idrogeologici: infatti, 1.700 di essi sono a rischi frana, 1.285 a rischio alluvione e addirittura 2.596 corrono entrambi i pericoli, con la conseguenza - ad essere precisi - che in cinquant'anni nel Paese si sono censite qualcosa come 500.000 frane. <p> Secondo il CRESME (Centro ricerche economiche, sociali e di mercato per l'edilizia e il territorio) i danni per i dissesti negli ultimi sessant'anni costano 52 miliardi di euro per la riparazione, mentre ne servono altri 40 per una buona prevenzione. Negli ultimi quattro anni, gli investimenti del Ministero dell'ambiente destinati a tenere sotto controllo il rischio idrogeologico sono stati quasi azzerati. È stato un taglio ingiusto e non ne capiamo il motivo. <p> Signora Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, signor rappresentante del Governo, crediamo davvero di risparmiare tagliando i fondi per la prevenzione dei rischi idrogeologici? Questa è la domanda che ci dobbiamo porre. Io penso proprio di no, perché è certificato che lo Stato, in caso di eventi disastrosi, rischia di spendere almeno dieci volte di più, proprio perché, in mancanza di interventi mirati, i costi per la riparazione dei danni e per la rimozione dei flussi fangosi sono enormi. È una cosa del resto già successa per le alluvioni del Veneto, della Toscana, delle Marche e della Campania, per le frane in Sicilia o, ancora, per gli eventi alluvionali dei mesi scorsi nei territori dell'Emilia-Romagna e della Liguria. <p> A migliore conferma, citerò un solo dato: nel 2007 il valore stimato dei danni prodottisi nelle diverse Regioni è stato pari allo 0,035 per cento del <PARTY>L (un punto percentuale del <PARTY>L vale circa 14 miliardi di euro), senza ovviamente considerare le vittime ed il milione di persone coinvolte. <p> Ciò nondimeno, c'è da denunciare che nel Paese, con un territorio allo sfascio dalle Alpi a Pantelleria, questi rischi vengono spesso ancora ignorati e trascurati dai responsabili della pianificazione territoriale, adducendo come giustificazione la loro fatalità, quando nei fatti gli eventi calamitosi si presentano sistematicamente ora in una Regione, ora nell'altra. Parlare, quindi, di imprevedibilità o di sorpresa geologica è da irresponsabili, proprio perché la difesa dai rischi e dai dissesti idrogeologici si impone in termini di previsione e di prevenzione. <p> In Italia purtroppo manca ancora la cultura del recupero ambientale, che di fatto si traduce nella previsione e nella prevenzione. Non ci si rende conto che il Paese è ad altissimo rischio e necessita di essere curato ed attenzionato perché è oltremodo soggetto a fragilità strutturali. Da noi si dovrebbero imporre prudenza ed intelligenza urbanistica, bloccando le continue deroghe alla normativa urbanistica, le costruzioni abusive ed invasive, la cementificazione selvaggia e la predazione inconsulta del territorio. Si dovrebbe invece investire, con adeguate forme di pianificazione territoriale, sulle opere di prevenzione e soprattutto sull'agricoltura, la quale non può essere abbandonata, perché, unitamente ai boschi ed alle pinete, presidia e cura il territorio ed il suo assetto vegetazionale e, come tale, costituisce la vera paladina per la lotta al dissesto ed al rischio idrogeologico, al degrado ed ai cambiamenti climatici. <p> Vi è perciò l'obbligo per il Governo ed il Parlamento di adottare politiche di riqualificazione in favore dell'agricoltura e del suo valore strategico come presidio fondamentale ed unico per il consolidamento e la manutenzione straordinaria del territorio e dell'ambiente, così da contrastare la desertificazione delle colline e delle montagne per il ripetersi di episodi calamitosi ed emergenziali sempre più gravi e difficilmente risolvibili con l'abbandono della campagna e degli spazi rurali, soprattutto da parte delle giovani generazioni. <p> Risulta, dunque, evidente che gli interventi integrati e di prevenzione ambientale, unitamente ai piani di messa in sicurezza del territorio, sono i soli che possano interrompere nel futuro le criticità idrogeologiche. Per non parlare, poi, dei terremoti o delle eruzioni vulcaniche, fenomenologie del resto alquanto presenti nella nostra penisola. <p> Nel nostro Paese siamo sempre in ritardo sui temi di politica ambientale. Nel settembre 2012, dopo il rovinoso crollo di una delle passeggiate più belle del mondo, la via dell'amore, alle Cinque Terre, il Ministro dell'ambiente di allora, Clini, dichiarò che si sarebbe fatto immediatamente un piano nazionale di prevenzione e di messa in sicurezza del territorio. Purtroppo, dopo un anno, siamo ancora in attesa. <p> Per capire l'importanza del problema sarebbe opportuno rilanciare, con forme di partecipazione attiva soprattutto nelle scuole e tra i giovani, la cultura dell'informazione e della prevenzione al rischio. <p> Bisogna rendersi conto che un piano di riduzione e gestione dei rischi idrogeologici costituisce uno straordinario strumento di rilancio economico ed occupazionale e come tale deve essere affrontato, superando l'approccio agli interventi una tantum o di somma urgenza che - progettati sulla base dell'emotività del momento e, aggiungerei, di interessi particolari - non sempre riescono a risolvere i gravi problemi connessi ai dissesti idrogeologici dei suoli; problemi così critici che, talune volte, costituiscono una seria minaccia per la perdita delle naturalità e delle biodiversità. Purtroppo, signora Presidente, ci si ricorda di intervenire con programmi integrati di difesa e manutenzione idrogeologica del territorio unitamente alla riqualificazione ambientale soltanto al prodursi delle emergenze per scordarsene, come per incanto, immediatamente un minuto dopo, per poi riparlarne al verificarsi del nuovo evento calamitoso. Occorre allora una politica seria e responsabile, a cominciare dall'istituzione di un'autorità unica per le emergenze ambientali e i dissesti idrogeologici. Non è possibile che per una calamità debbano ancora intervenire il Ministero dell'ambiente, il Ministero delle infrastrutture, la Regione, la Provincia, la Protezione civile, il Corpo forestale: alla fine non si capisce mai nulla! È possibile, signor rappresentante del Governo, unificare gli interventi in modo che vi sia un unico organismo, un'unica autorità incaricata di gestire quell'evento, quella calamità che provoca sempre morti e disastri? Inoltre, in Italia abbiamo dimenticato l'importanza di una politica di riforestazione; non so da quanti anni non si fanno programmi di riforestazione. Siamo carenti anche nella manutenzione ordinaria dei fiumi e dei corsi d'acqua. Al riguardo occorre pianificare le autorizzazioni e le concessioni per produrre energia idroelettrica. Signor Sottosegretario, le spiego cosa accade in quest'ambito: con una autorizzazione del 1933, tale produzione è stata data in concessione ad ENEL che, nei momenti di grave difficoltà, apre gli invasi facendo in modo che l'acqua a valanga arrivi sui fiumi, con danni notevolissimi a persone prima e a cose dopo. Ritengo che questa mozione sia un atto di grande responsabilità del Parlamento e del Governo per attivare le minime forme di sicurezza, finalizzate a consentire una maggiore serenità per il nostro territorio.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6656872034072876, 0.3343128263950348]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, arriviamo a questo appuntamento di riforma della magistratura onoraria dopo un lungo iter in Commissione, un intervento incrociato tra disegni di legge di iniziativa parlamentare, disegno di legge proposto dal Governo e una lunga serie di relazioni e audizioni in Commissione dei soggetti interessati, giudici onorari di tribunale, viceprocuratori onorari e giudice di pace. Ci arriviamo con un disegno di legge delega che definisce criteri e principi che abbiamo cercato di articolare nella maniera più dettagliata possibile per definire in modo chiaro il quadro al cui interno il Governo si dovrà muovere per mettere mano ad una materia molto complicata che tiene conto di esigenze diverse. Il primo principio, evidentemente, è quello di una giustizia, quella italiana, che ha bisogno di una serie di interventi di razionalizzazione per il suo funzionamento. Oggi, infatti, uno degli elementi che meno garantiscono la giustizia sociale e la giustizia effettiva in questo Paese è proprio il cattivo funzionamento del sistema giudiziario, dovuto alle sue farraginosità e ad alcune questioni strutturali che fanno sì che il nostro sia uno dei Paesi in cui è più difficile, sia in sede penale che civile, riuscire a raggiungere una sentenza in tempi certi. Sappiamo cosa significhi ciò, non solo in termini di lesione dei diritti delle persone direttamente impegnate a diverso titolo in un procedimento giudiziario, ma anche nei termini di lesione di un diritto generale che, ad esempio, tiene lontani dal nostro Paese investimenti economici importanti proprio per la difficoltà di poter poi contare sul sistema giudiziario e quindi su un sistema di garanzie, di diritti, di regole e di rispetto delle normative realmente efficace ed efficiente. La riforma della magistratura onoraria rappresenta solamente un aspetto del lavoro che questo Governo e questa maggioranza parlamentare stanno portando avanti da tempo. Sono già diversi gli interventi previsti dalla Commissione giustizia e altri ancora ne arriveranno, in Commissione e in Aula, per definire una riforma più generale dei procedimenti, e anche dello stesso processo. Qui parliamo di un aspetto importante, che rappresenta il modo in cui gestiamo il sostegno al lavoro ordinario della magistratura che decidiamo di affidare alla magistratura onoraria. È evidente che, fino ad oggi, c'è stato un gap fra la definizione formale di queste figure e il modo in cui effettivamente venivano utilizzate, a partire dalla deficienza del sistema. Infatti, la difficoltà di portare avanti in tempi rapidi i procedimenti attraverso il ricorso alla magistratura ordinaria ha sviluppato un utilizzo della magistratura onoraria e dei giudici di pace abnorme rispetto agli obiettivi e alle funzioni loro assegnate. Anche su questo si cerca di fare chiarezza a partire da un punto che ritengo condivisibile: evitare quella contraddizione che si è creata nel tempo tra magistrati che accedono per concorso ordinario ai ranghi della magistratura e una sorta di magistratura supplente, che va a svolgere compiti di sostegno alla magistratura ordinaria quando quest'ultima non ce la fa. Questo disegno di legge delega si ripropone dunque di individuare uno spazio autonomo, uno spazio definito per la magistratura onoraria. Quindi, è da salutare positivamente, a mio giudizio, quella semplificazione che riduce a due le figure dei giudici: da una parte, il giudice di pace onorario, inquadrato nell'ufficio del giudice di pace, ma che potrà essere poi indirizzato dal presidente del tribunale presso l'ufficio del processo, che rappresenta una delle innovazioni più significative rispetto alla più generale riforma della giustizia che il ministro Orlando sta cercando, un pezzo alla volta, di mettere a sistema e, dall'altra, la figura del procuratore onorario inquadrato all'interno della procura. È poi positivo che si definisca in modo più chiaro che queste figure siano effettivamente onorarie e che, quindi, svolgono la funzione non come lavoro prioritario o attività preponderante all'interno della propria funzione professionale, ma come attività aggiuntiva. Da qui, la definizione di un tempo pari a tre - in certi casi quattro - quadrienni per le possibili conferme dell'incarico dopo verifica, posto che la durata standard di utilizzo di un professionista come magistrato onorario è pari a quattro anni. È altresì importante l'aver definito in modo chiaro le competenze. Desidero sottolineare in modo specifico che si è deciso di tener fuori dalle funzioni del giudice onorario di pace la trattazione dei procedimenti in materia di rapporti di lavoro, previdenza ed assistenza obbligatoria, che rimangono nella funzione del magistrato ordinario per la loro particolare delicatezza. Tra gli emendamenti presentati, desidero sottolinearne due particolarmente importanti. L'emendamento 2.320 stabilisce che i magistrati onorari in servizio possono essere confermati nell'incarico non per tre, ma per quattro mandati di durata quadriennale. Onorevoli colleghe e colleghi, c'è un tema molto importante che il provvedimento in esame deve trattare in maniera molto, ma molto delicata. Stiamo andando a ridefinire una figura nuova e più leggera anche rispetto all'investimento professionale del singolo, in quanto si tratta, per l'appunto, di una funzione svolta solo per una parte della vita ed aggiuntiva all'attività principale esercitata. Non possiamo tacere il fatto che oggi, per esigenze del sistema, abbiamo richiesto a tante persone lo svolgimento della funzione di giudice di pace o giudice onorario, di fatto, come attività preponderante per lunghissimi periodi della propria vita. È quindi evidente che, nel momento in cui alleggeriamo (fatemi usare questa parola nel senso che ho spiegato meglio prima) questa figura, dobbiamo considerare l'investimento professionale ed umano che ogni giudice di pace e magistrato onorario ha fatto negli anni in cui ha svolto questa delicatissima funzione. Per questo, con riferimento al tema del regime transitorio, ben venga quindi l'allungamento a quattro quadrienni della possibilità di riconferma degli attuali magistrati onorari e giudici di pace, anche spostando un po' più avanti il momento di decorrenza del termine, ossia dall'entrata in vigore del decreto legislativo all'entrata in vigore dell'ultimo dei decreti legislativi attuativi della delega contenuta nel provvedimento. Ricordo che tale modifica è stata apportata dalla Commissione giustizia.

L'attuale Governo ha dato al Paese intero un segnale chiaro di cambiamento. <p> E questo è il primo passo del Governo del cambiamento. Quante volte abbiamo assistito, in questi anni, a vertici europei che parlavano di leale collaborazione, di solidarietà (per la gestione dell'immigrazione soprattutto), di una politica comune? Quante strette di mano, quante parole al vento, per fingere l'esistenza di un'Europa unita e solidale! I cittadini italiani alle scorse elezioni hanno capito di essere stati presi in giro da Governi che si sono dimostrati incapaci di passare dalle parole ai fatti nei rapporti con l'Unione europea, in particolare sul tema dell'immigrazione. L'Italia è stata abbandonata ai suoi doveri; la frontiera europea ormai si è spostata a nord dell'Europa. <p> Qualcuno ha definito vomitevole l'azione politica di questo Governo e questo qualcuno, la Francia, è proprio quel Paese che ha chiuso le frontiere di Ventimiglia e che è responsabile del vergognoso fatto di Bardonecchia, quando le autorità francesi hanno chiuso le porte a una donna nigeriana incinta e malata, poi morta dopo il parto. <p> Proprio quel Paese si è affrettato a smentire la disponibilità ad accogliere la nave Aquarius la scorsa mattina. <p> Noi non accettiamo lezioni di civiltà dalla Francia o da qualunque altro Paese, neanche dalla Spagna delle barriere di Ceuta e Melilla, e non accettiamo lezioni di umanità da forze politiche bocciate alle urne dagli elettori e che hanno ridotto questa Nazione allo stato attuale, specialmente in tema immigrazione. <p> La gestione incontrollata dei flussi migratori ha portato, negli ultimi quattro anni, a oltre 15.000 morti in mare e ci è costata miliardi e miliardi di euro: quanto accaduto non ha assolutamente nulla a che vedere con l'immigrazione che ho vissuto io. Bisogna essere chiari: l'unico modo per non far morire in mare queste persone è non farli partire attraverso quei tunnel della morte. <p> La criminalità organizzata nel Nord Africa continua a gestire la tratta degli esseri umani e noi non possiamo continuare né a gestire da soli questo fenomeno, né ad illudere, con il buonismo, migliaia e migliaia di giovani africani rispetto a un futuro in Italia che è difficile per i nostri stessi giovani. <p> Questo Governo, a differenza dei Governi precedenti, chiama l'Europa ai suoi doveri, svegliando la coscienza della comunità internazionale e chiedendo con i fatti e a gran voce che l'Italia non sia lasciata da sola ancora una volta: e, chissà perché, quando c'è qualcuno che chiede o decide di cambiare davvero le cose, tutti criticano senza avanzare mezza soluzione al problema. <p> Ministro Salvini, apprezziamo profondamente il suo equilibro, la sua saggezza, il suo coraggio e il buonsenso, con i quali ha iniziato finalmente a risolvere questo problema. <p> IWOBI (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, signori colleghi, il 23 febbraio scorso a Roma è improvvisamente scomparsa Carla Accardi, artista tra le più originali dell'arte del secondo dopoguerra italiano. Era nata a Trapani nel 1924 e avrebbe compiuto 90 anni il 9 ottobre prossimo. Definita la «signora dell'astrattismo italiano», con la sua pittura ha contribuito dal 1947 all'affermazione della corrente pittorica in Italia. Dopo il diploma al liceo «L. Ximenes» di Trapani, si trasferisce a Palermo per gli studi all'Accademia di belle arti. Dal 1946 è a Roma dove frequenta l'Osteria Fratelli Menghi, noto punto di ritrovo per pittori, registi, sceneggiatori, scrittori e poeti tra gli anni Quaranta e gli anni Settanta. L'incontro decisivo è con un altro siciliano, fuggito dall'isola contemporaneamente a lei, il geniale ed influente Antonio Sanfilippo, che diventerà suo marito nel 1949. Nel 1947 con Attardi, Consagra, Dorazio ed altri pittori, fonda il Gruppo «Forma 1». Nasce così l'astrattismo italiano. Coraggiosa, determinata, intraprendente, ambiziosa, sguardo sempre avanti: scompare un personaggio chiave nelle dinamiche creative del dopoguerra italiano. Una carriera esemplare che inizia dall'etica politica. Divenne, infatti, un simbolo come una delle prime donne a trovare spazio in un ambiente fino ad allora alquanto maschilista. In quei primi anni del dopoguerra contribuì a portare a Roma una ventata di energia siciliana. Venivano dalla Sicilia, insomma, le prime e più potenti istanze creative italiane. Otto Biennali alle spalle, prolifica e vitale, appartiene a quella generazione di donne che, a partire dagli anni Quaranta, ha decretato la fine dell'emarginazione della creatività femminile. Tra le pioniere del femminismo in Italia, fa parte con Carla Lonzi del gruppo «Rivolta Femminile». Nel 1964, una sua personale alla Biennale di Venezia la impone all'attenzione internazionale. Negli anni Settanta la sua ricerca la porta alle «Tende», vere e proprie strutture abitabili e percorribili, e negli anni Ottanta la sperimentazione delle tele grezze da cui trapelano stesure cromatiche di varia intensità. Nel 1995 partecipa anche alla mostra The Italian Metamorphosis a New York. Nel 1996 è nominata membro dell'Accademia di Brera e nel 1997 fa parte della Commissione per la Biennale di Venezia nel ruolo di consigliere. Nel ritratto di Carla Accardi tracciato da Marco Vallora, viene messo in evidenza un suo credo: trovare la trasparenza, in tutto; uscire anche dalla gabbia della pittura, pur di lasciar galleggiare la libertà del pensiero e dei suoi meccanismi analitici annodati. Della sua opera Carla Accardi diceva: «L'interesse per me era la trasparenza, infatti si vedeva il telaio. Volevo rendere trasparente quello che era intorno a noi». Ricordare Carla Accardi oggi è rendere omaggio ad una donna, un'artista siciliana che ha portato la città di Trapani nella storia dell'arte moderna e che ha saputo esprimere coraggiosamente, liberamente, fieramente i suoi ideali e il suo talento, rivendicando con la sua arte e le sue battaglie politiche il genio femminile.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5631462335586548, 0.4368537366390228]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> NISINI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il Gruppo <PARTY> dà complessivamente una valutazione positiva ai due documenti in esame. Il primo ringraziamento va al Collegio dei Questori, composto dai senatori Arrigoni, De Poli e Bottici, e alla professionalità dei dipendenti dell'Amministrazione del Senato, del Segretario Generale e di tutti i suoi collaboratori. La relazione appena illustrata dal collega Questore De Poli è stata più che esaustiva ed ha messo in evidenza un netto miglioramento dei conti sia in termini di contenimento della spesa, che di razionalizzazione dei servizi. Grazie all'impegno che ci siamo assunti sulla riduzione delle spese, anche attraverso una maggiore attenzione verso il tema dell'impatto ambientale e la digitalizzazione di documenti e processi, possiamo affermare di essere sulla strada giusta sia dal punto di vista del risultato di esercizio, che su quello dei principi ispiratori che hanno portato ad avere considerevoli risparmi di spesa. Come si può notare, inoltre, il peso finanziario del Senato sulla finanza pubblica è stato ridotto in sette anni di circa 255 milioni di euro e la dotazione si è ridotta di ben 151 milioni dall'inizio della scorsa legislatura. Tali numeri indicano come il contenimento della spesa non è semplicemente uno spot, bensì un impegno strutturale che l'istituzione Senato si è presa con i propri cittadini in anni nei quali la crisi economica e finanziaria ha fatto sentire tutto il proprio peso su imprese e famiglie. Un altro segnale importante è riconducibile alla razionalizzazione della spesa mediante il processo di integrazione delle amministrazioni del Senato e della Camera, che ha portato alla nascita del Polo della documentazione parlamentare e del Polo informatico parlamentare, oltre al rafforzamento del già esistente Polo bibliotecario parlamentare ed una più stretta collaborazione fra gli Archivi storici. Il proseguimento della razionalizzazione delle spese per il personale, per le indennità parlamentari e per le spese previdenziali sono tutte misure che apprezziamo e che ci auguriamo possano proseguire in futuro. Il citato contenimento dei costi comunque non è andato ad intaccare la qualità dei servizi, come si evince dai dati elencati nella relazione, che evidenziano come il Senato sia un ente molto virtuoso in termini di pagamento delle fatture, con tempi entro i trentasei giorni e con il 98 per cento di fatture saldate; sono numeri molto positivi che mettono la nostra istituzione davanti alla media UE e a Paesi come Francia e Spagna. Allo stesso modo registriamo positivamente il cronoprogramma dei concorsi pubblici per il reclutamento del personale, deliberato dal Consiglio di Presidenza a fine luglio, che consentirà di avere circa 120 nuovi ingressi come coadiutori, assistenti e segretari parlamentari entro la fine dell'anno. Da registrare è sicuramente l'impegno nel voler arrivare a conseguire risparmi partendo dagli investimenti. Ne sono la prova le voci che riguardano investimenti nella manutenzione straordinaria finalizzata alla riqualificazione e all'efficientamento energetico, alla tutela ambientale, alla manutenzione straordinaria finalizzata all'eliminazione delle barriere architettoniche e quelli finalizzati alla riqualificazione delle aree adiacenti ai palazzi del Senato; interventi che ci auguriamo possano concretizzarsi al più presto, che porteranno ulteriori risparmi sui conti e una fruizione migliore degli spazi. Con la grande consapevolezza che ancora oggi il nostro Paese sta attraversando un lungo periodo di crisi economica, dobbiamo sentire la responsabilità di gestire le risorse degli italiani con attenzione e parsimonia. Non dobbiamo dimenticarci che noi tutti siamo qui in rappresentanza del popolo e non possiamo permetterci di deluderne le aspettative. Per questo, consapevoli di essere sulla strada giusta, siamo certi che il Collegio dei Questori e il Consiglio di Presidenza e tutti noi ci prenderemo l'impegno di proseguire su questo percorso. Per tutti questi motivi, garantiremo naturalmente un voto favorevole ai documenti in esame.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5734837651252747, 0.42651620507240295]}, {'sequence': 'Signor Presidente, in linea di principio il nostro Gruppo e io personalmente siamo contrari alle mozioni di sfiducia individuali, perché riteniamo che la responsabilità delle azioni di Governo sia collettiva. Va detto in questo caso che certamente il ministro Toninelli è passato agli onori della cronaca più che per le azioni positive o anche negative del suo Dicastero, piuttosto per le sue parole e i suoi atteggiamenti e per il suo essere al centro del gossip giornalistico. Non so quanto sia per sua colpa, ma è così. In più va detto, colleghi, che la delega che grava sulle spalle del ministro Toninelli non è meramente amministrativa, come per altri Dicasteri, ma potremmo definirla con altro nome, magari più fantasioso, la \"delega del futuro\": le infrastrutture di una Nazione attengono strettamente alla sua capacità di stare dentro il futuro e intercettare il progresso. Questo, Ministro, è l\\'aspetto più negativo - a mio avviso - di quanto accaduto in quasi un anno di gestione della delega. Vorrei ricordare molto brevemente che, quando il Governo si insediò, aveva sul tavolo lavori per circa 23 miliardi di euro, che cerco brevemente di riepilogare: il Terzo valico dei Giovi lungo l\\'asse Genova-Milano, per un valore globale di 6,2 miliardi, bloccati dall\\'analisi costi-benefici della famosa commissione del professor Ponti; l\\'asse Brescia-Verona, approvata dal CIPE, per 2 miliardi di euro, con atto integrativo firmato da Rete ferroviaria italiana con il g eneral contractor, bloccata anche questa dalla famosa commissione del professor Ponti; l\\'asse Verona-Bivio Vicenza, opera approvata dal CIPE per un importo di 2,7 miliardi, per cui è in corso la sottoscrizione dell\\'atto integrativo di Rete ferroviaria italiana e del general contractor, ma anche in questo caso l\\'opera è bloccata dalla commissione del professor Ponti. Vi è poi la Vicenza-Padova, progetto definitivo disponibile, compreso il nodo di Vicenza: non c\\'è bisogno di fare la gara, esiste apposita concessione al general contractor, ma anche in questo caso l\\'opera è bloccata dal mitico professor Ponti. Con riguardo all\\'asse Napoli-Bari, per la realizzazione dell\\'intervento è previsto apposito commissario straordinario, questa volta con pieni poteri: attualmente sono stati affidati due lotti per un importo globale di circa 700 milioni euro, la parte restante è di 3,4 miliardi di euro e il commissario, attualmente amministratore delegato di Rete ferroviaria italiana, potrebbe affidare i vari lotti utilizzando modalità che trasferiscono ai vincitori delle gare anche la redazione dei progetti. Per l\\'asse Palermo-Catania l\\'importo dell\\'opera si attesta su un valore pari a 5 miliardi di euro e per la realizzazione degli interventi è previsto apposito commissario straordinario con pieni poteri; attualmente è escluso il primo lotto nella zona di Himera e non è stato affidato nulla. Anche in quest\\'ultimo caso il commissario è l\\'attuale amministratore di Rete ferroviaria italiana: potrebbe affidare i lotti utilizzando le modalità che trasferiscono, di cui sopra. Da questo elenco, se il Governo volesse, potrebbe sbloccare da subito opere per circa 23 miliardi di euro. <p> Qui, Ministro, mi viene legittimamente un dubbio: non è per caso che i danari citati non ci sono più? Non è per caso che quanto avete fatto con l\\'ultima finanziaria, e cioè il taglio a Rete ferroviaria italiana di 2,6 miliardi di euro che blocca praticamente ogni attività per tutto il 2019, analogamente l\\'avete fatto per tutte le opere che ho appena citato e che non erano - attenzione - dei precedenti Governi - né quello Gentiloni, né gli altri - ma erano residui della famigerata - come suggerisce la collega - legge obiettivo? Era questo tutto ciò che lei aveva sul tavolo. <p> Ma allora, che cosa avete fatto di quelle risorse? Ce lo dice, Ministro? Vede, rispetto alle parole per le quali lei è passato alla storia, noi registriamo anche la vicenda dello smontaggio della fusione tra Anas e Ferrovie dello Stato, quasi un fare le buche e riempirle alla prima occasione. <p> Ci spieghi, signor Ministro, perché, quando parla un Ministro, non parla un senatore, un libero cittadino o un portavoce del <PARTY>: parla lo Stato e, davanti alle parole dello Stato, la gente si fida, tende ancora a fidarsi, nonostante tutto; le aziende fanno i loro progetti e le amministrazioni locali decidono il loro piano di investimenti. Pertanto, aver montato la benedetta fusione tra Anas e Ferrovie dello Stato - e poi sappiamo anche a chi solo ha portato effettivamente benefici, perlomeno allo stato attuale - e decidere poi, dopo qualche mese, di smontarla, genera nell\\'ambito delle due aziende uno stato di incertezza e indeterminatezza e i decisori, i gestori e i consigli di amministrazione aspettano di capire che cosa succede. <p> Dobbiamo rismontare questa fusione? Ce lo dica, Ministro, perché non basta declamare, o meglio: prima di declamare bisognerebbe avere la certezza di poter fare, perché altrimenti tutto ciò provoca davvero danni irreparabili al suo Dicastero. <p> Mi avvio a concludere, premettendo che i dieci minuti a disposizione purtroppo sono pochi, anche per descrivere il nulla. <p> Cito la vicenda del Centro Italia, del famoso e famigerato Quadrilatero, la vicenda della Astaldi e quanto sta accadendo con un numero enorme di imprese che stanno saltando come le castagne sul fuoco. Quelle imprese hanno lavorato, signor Ministro, e il lavoro deve essere pagato. <p> Il lavoro non può essere tritato all\\'interno di una procedura e dell\\'iperfinanziarizzazione di ogni appalto e progetto. <p> Avete detto che avreste messo mano al codice degli appalti, che avreste cancellato la famigerata pratica del general contractor : dove sta la riforma del codice degli appalti? <p> È passato un anno dal suo insediamento, signor Ministro: in un anno si fanno tante cose, ma veramente tante. <p> Colleghi, ribadisco che, per quanto ci riguarda - ma lo dirà meglio di me la collega Santanchè intervenendo in dichiarazione di voto - non siamo affascinati più di tanto dalle mozioni di sfiducia individuale, anche perché credo che i numeri dell\\'Assemblea possano già farci prevedere quale sarà l\\'esito del voto sulle mozioni oggi in discussione. Approfittiamo però di questo passaggio - e questo è il senso del mio intervento - per farci spiegare dal Ministro, che immagino farà un intervento in replica e chiarirà alcuni passaggi, che cosa sta facendo, perché questo vorremmo capire. Vorremmo capire che cosa sta succedendo nel suo benedetto Ministero, come trascorrete la giornata, come riempite le otto, dieci o dodici ore lavorative. Questo ci dovete spiegare. <p> Un\\'intera Nazione sta aspettando; ci sono opere ferme, commissari ad acta, commissari straordinari.

È la realtà nella quale (ricordo un episodio abbastanza recente) c'è stata una gara di solidarietà per contribuire alla ricostruzione del teatro La Fenice, distrutto da un incendio. C'è l'idea che Venezia appartenga a tutto il mondo. <p> Questo deve finalmente influire sulle azioni di questo Parlamento e di questo Senato, ad iniziare da stasera, dopo la volontà inizialmente espressa dai ministri Clini e Passera nel Governo del 2012, successivamente sostenuta (e corroborata persino da date e meccanismi) nell'incontro che si è tenuto il 5 novembre del 2013, grazie alla volontà dei ministri Orlando e Lupi. Essi hanno inteso iniziare un percorso teso a garantire e tutelare che questa straordinaria e unica realtà al mondo non possa essere da nessuno e per nessuna ragione intaccata per colpa dell'ignavia e dell'irresponsabilità degli uomini e delle donne del nostro tempo. <p> Con la mozione che abbiamo sottoscritto, a prima firma del senatore Casson, (così come è stato fatto con altre mozioni illustrate con gli interventi che abbiamo ascoltato) abbiamo voluto aprire una finestra per sottolineare che siamo tutti concordi nel dire che questa è una città che non può subire alcun rischio come quello che viene perpetrato ogni giorno, di fatto, perché c'è una scala che non torna. Le grandi navi che transitano a Venezia un tempo erano modeste rispetto al contesto, sotto le 40.000 tonnellate, ma poi sono arrivate a 80‑90.000 tonnellate.

Ma dall'altro lato non può starci nella scala di valori veder transitare navi che raggiungono e superano le 120-130.000 tonnellate, se questo può tradursi non solo in un danno alla lunga intesa come bacino acquifero, del quale forse abbiamo parlato relativamente poco, ma addirittura in un danno a un contesto urbano irriproducibile e unico al mondo. <p> Da questo siamo partiti per dire che dobbiamo intervenire. Dobbiamo fare in modo - questa è la scommessa straordinaria - di conciliare la possibilità che Venezia continui ad essere indicata come meta nella crocieristica internazionale e come meta di viaggio (perché obiettivamente credo che sia irrinunciabile considerarla come tale), salvaguardandola però all'interno del suo delicatissimo e già oggi fortemente discusso e discutibile equilibrio dal punto di vista idrografico, ambientale e quant'altro. <p> Come Commissione ambiente abbiamo svolto molte audizioni a Venezia per ascoltare tutti coloro che avevano qualcosa da dire sull'occupazione, sul turismo, sull'attività portuale nonché sulle difficoltà esistenti, come ad esempio ha fatto un ingegnere dell'Istituto di idraulica dell'Università di Padova, che ci ha spiegato quali sono le tensioni già esistenti all'interno della laguna di Venezia. <p> Da tutto ciò abbiamo tratto delle conclusioni. Riteniamo che sia possibile e necessario intervenire per rinvenire una via alternativa a quella del canale della Giudecca, attualmente utilizzata per percorsi di questa natura. Noi sappiamo che dal novembre 2014 vi sarà la limitazione del tonnellaggio, e i traghetti che hanno una diversa funzione di viaggio rispetto alle grandi navi da crociera non potranno più attraccare al porto usuale, ma dovranno scegliere un altro percorso per entrare a Venezia. Sappiamo che vi sarà una notevole riduzione di traffico e questo mi pare sia stato opportunamente ed equilibratamente accettato da tutti. <p> Come ha appena ricordato la senatrice Bonfrisco, stiamo parlando di oltre 4.000 lavoratori e a tutti noi preoccupa, oggi più che mai, mantenere l'occupazione. Pertanto dobbiamo trovare il modo di conciliare questo con la necessità di intervenire su un tema non pensando neppure per un istante che si possa fare scelta diversa senza renderla trasparente e partecipata. <p> Credo che questo sia oggi indifferibile e obbligatorio, il che vuol dire che dobbiamo portare a casa un risultato che veda contestualmente l'inizio, l'avvio di un percorso fattivo e operativo, funzionale ad ottenere il risultato e nel contempo che questo risultato venga compreso non solo dai residenti di Venezia, ma da tutto il pianeta Terra, che a Venezia guarda con quell'occhio speciale che ha fatto dire al presidente Obama ed alla Merkel determinate cose e che ha fatto incredibilmente riflettere e chiedere immediate e possibilmente efficaci soluzioni ad un problema della natura di quello che si è posto. <p> Valuto quindi con molto favore il fatto che siamo intervenuti, anche se purtroppo questa sera ormai l'ora è tarda, ma domani concluderemo l'esame delle mozioni con le dichiarazioni di voto. Spero davvero che ci sarà un voto unanime su una mozione che stiamo cercando di costruire come sommatoria delle diverse mozioni e delle diverse volontà, mettendo in chiaro dei punti a partire dalla celerità nell'ambito della trasparenza. È una bella scommessa per la politica, signora Presidente, agire nella trasparenza che ci deve essere, perché se ci riescono gli altri in Europa non si capisce perché non dobbiamo riuscirci noi, visto che non abbiamo nulla da nascondere. Contemporaneamente dobbiamo porre in essere azioni che risultino chiare dal punto di vista della modalità con cui maturano le scelte che si devono compiere, azioni peraltro efficaci, perché raggiungeranno l'obiettivo che ci siamo prefissati. <p> Nel contempo, riusciranno in tempi assolutamente rapidi, per come s'intende normalmente che debba essere per un fatto di questa natura. Si intraprenderà quindi un percorso partecipato, ma celere, per raggiungere l'obiettivo di salvare Venezia e nello stesso tempo l'occupazione, soprattutto portuale, che la Venezia turistica è in grado di dare, e soprattutto per far sì che proseguano le visite certamente gradite di tutti coloro che la amano, ma che vogliono arrivare attraverso il mare.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6399893760681152, 0.36001065373420715]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, signora Ministro, c'è una questione di metodo che mi pare più grave della richiesta di parere al CNEL. ( Brusìo) Aspetto che ci sia del silenzio. PRESIDENTE. Lei è un esperto, conquisti l'Assemblea. NENCINI (<PARTY>). Sono solo educato. PRESIDENTE. Prego i colleghi che non sono interessati alla discussione di lasciare l'Aula. NENCINI (<PARTY>). C'è una questione che vorrei porre in modo pregiudiziale, e che forse è parimenti rilevante rispetto al parere del CNEL. Se noi discutiamo di un decreto così importante quando mancano 72 ore alla sua decadenza, vuol dire che una delle due Camere ha trattenuto il provvedimento per un tempo abnorme. Quindi, abbiamo risolto la questione del bicameralismo perfetto introducendo, di fatto, il sistema del monocameralismo alternato. È successo altre volte che sia stato il Senato a discutere evitando che la Camera a sua volta lo facesse. Succede per la seconda volta al Senato - che io ricordi, in tempi molto brevi - di discutere fintamente un provvedimento significativo senza avere la possibilità di apportare emendamenti. Farò alla fine una proposta al Ministro e al Sottosegretario che seguono i nostri lavori e spero che, solo per questa ragione, venga accolta e fatta loro. Quella nella quale il decreto‑legge Carrozza si muove è una cornice che possiamo condividere: è una cornice innovativa per alcuni versi che sono stati già sottolineati dalla relatrice, e che per ragioni di tempo non ricordo, ma è una cornice che, al contempo, il Ministro competente ci ricorda inserirsi in una sorta - e non è sua responsabilità - di difetto di salvadanaio. Viene cioè segnalata una serie di problemi e di nodi da sciogliere, ma al contempo si mette la questione sotto la luce di un difetto di salvadanaio per affrontarli e portarli a soluzione. Tralascerò le valutazioni che stanno in testa al decreto, le quali riguardano una nostra identità e una nostra considerazione decisamente superiore a ciò che oggi l'Italia rappresenta in termini di conoscenza, cultura ed istruzione. Noi siamo figli di una storia straordinaria, ma non siamo più figli di un presente straordinario. Per taluni versi, anzi, se guardiamo le tante statistiche, perlomeno europee, possiamo dire di essere fuori dalla norma che considera molti Paesi in tema di istruzione, conoscenza e cultura al di sopra di un gradino di normalità che noi abbiamo disceso ormai da tempo. C'è un punto, l'articolo 1, per il quale utilizzo i minuti che mi rimangono, sul quale plaudo al Ministro e mi stupisco del comportamento della Commissione competente alla Camera. All'articolo 1 è stato fatto - io reputo - un errore straordinario quando si è soppresso, nell'attribuzione di contributi e benefici, il titolo del merito, espungendolo dall'articolato del decreto. Lo sottolineo perché, quando parliamo di merito, molte volte certa sinistra lo considera tema completamente al di fuori e al di là della sua appartenenza. La questione del merito è invece assolutamente attribuibile al riformismo di sinistra. Lo dico perché il merito è una di quelle categorie attraverso le quali è possibile considerare scalabile la gerarchia sociale, anche se si fa parte di famiglie che appartengono al mondo e alla categoria del bisogno. <p> Senza valutazione del merito non sono scalabili gerarchie sociali che il ministro Carrozza, pisana, sa benissimo essere state più volte sottolineate anche dall'università che l'ha vista per molti anni rettore. Lo dico perché su questo punto il Senato, se ne avesse avuto la possibilità, avrebbe potuto reintrodurre, emendare un tema che la Camera, nella Commissione competente, ha espunto. <p> L'altra considerazione riguarda - anche qui rientra il tema del merito - la questione delle università cosiddette virtuose. Noi possiamo discutere sull'attribuzione del titolo «virtuoso» ad alcune università italiane; ciò che però non possiamo fare, da questo punto di vista, è espungere una valutazione, in denaro attribuibile a queste università, tagliando fondi che invece andavano riconosciuti. <p> Sottolineo con favore, invece, nell'articolo 5, il tema della formazione dei docenti e della fruizione del patrimonio culturale. In un emendamento avrei suggerito di collegarlo meglio al turismo e a chi si occupa di turismo a livello governativo. <p> Tema altrettanto di favore è quello della lotta alla dispersione scolastica, troppo alta in Italia. Mentre un tempo, agli inizi degli anni 2000, essa era figlia della possibilità che si dava a molti ragazzi e ragazze di entrare immediatamente nel mercato del lavoro, oggi purtroppo non è più così: non si entra nel mercato del lavoro e ci si allontana soltanto dal mondo scolastico. <p> Da ultimo, avrei aggiunto un emendamento (ritirato) che riguardava gli studenti meritevoli che lavorano fuori sede. Noi abbiamo ormai un numero straordinariamente alto di famiglie italiane che hanno figli che studiano lontano dalle loro città di residenza, famiglie che non sono più nella condizione di mantenere quei figli. Molti di questi ragazzi sono meritevoli, hanno cioè il coraggio e la competenza per continuare a studiare fuori dalle loro città di appartenenza, ma le famiglie non sono più in grado di sostenerli. Non so se l'Aula sia nella condizione di produrre immediatamente un ordine del giorno in tale direzione. <p> Noi abbiamo presentato, accolti dalla Commissione, una serie di ordini del giorno. Tre di questi, signor Ministro, sono relativi, prima alle pluriclassi e a un tetto per gli studenti da inserire all'interno delle pluriclassi, secondo, ai professori associati e, terzo, ai ricercatori universitari. Si tratta - lo ripeto - di ordini del giorno che la Commissione ha assunto come propri. Ora non c'è la possibilità di sottoporre all'Assemblea emendamenti (lo ha spiegato benissimo la relatrice). Quello che possiamo fare è chiedere al Ministro - e quindi al Governo - che gli ordini del giorno che la Commissione ha varato e quelli che l'Aula varerà siano assunti come responsabilità del Governo, non soltanto come indirizzo. So bene che l'ordine del giorno lascia il tempo che trova; so anche altrettanto bene che, se viene assunto sotto la responsabilità del Governo, può avere il valore di un emendamento: il valore politico di un emendamento. Ripeto, signor Sottosegretario: il valore politico di un emendamento. So bene che non può modificare la norma. Ma se il Ministro si assume la responsabilità di dare una valutazione degli ordini del giorno che la Commissione ha varato e di assumerli come propri, siamo nella condizione di superare la questione tempo, la questione del monocameralismo a intermittenza, e di consegnare al Governo un documento che venga condiviso e inserito nella scia istituzionale della norma, ancorché non emendamento.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.8438645005226135, 0.15613554418087006]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> ALBERTI CASELLATI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, questo ordine del giorno, sostanzialmente unitario, rappresenta anzitutto un esercizio di buonsenso, un esercizio che purtroppo non sempre le istituzioni hanno dimostrato di saper effettuare. Sin dal principio, con la presentazione originaria di un nostra mozione, Forza Italia ha affrontato la delicata questione del traffico crocieristico nella laguna di Venezia con la consapevolezza di dover coniugare il rispetto dei luoghi con il rispetto delle persone che in quei luoghi vivono, operano e lavorano. Ci siamo quindi posti in maniera critica verso le tentazioni volte ad affrontare la questione del traffico crocieristico nel porto di Venezia solo sulla scia di valutazioni pseudo-ambientali, come del resto abbiamo sempre ritenuto che non si possa agire sull'onda emotiva di singoli casi di cronaca (la cui veridicità ed effettività sono fra l'altro al vaglio dell'autorità giudiziaria), quando è in ballo il futuro economico, il futuro occupazionale, il futuro sociale di una città e di un intero bacino produttivo. Per questo il Gruppo di Forza Italia ha sostenuto con convinzione la propria mozione, così come con convinzione voterà questa soluzione condivisa, che considera una buona e giusta sintesi tra le esigenze ambientali (intendo quelle vere) e la salvaguardia di centinaia di medie e piccole imprese e di migliaia di lavoratori. Non farlo avrebbe significato non tenere in alcuna considerazione le ragioni di uno sviluppo sostenibile, in grado di coniugare la tutela del nostro patrimonio storico-artistico con le esigenze di valorizzazione e fruizione turistico-culturali. I dati economici relativi al turismo crocieristico a Venezia e le sue ripercussioni sul territorio sono già stati citati nel corso della discussione che si è svolta ieri in quest'Aula. Ne voglio qui ricordare alcuni per la loro oggettività e rilevanza: 4.255 addetti occupati per una spesa totale aggregata di oltre 430 milioni di euro; quasi 1.800.000 crocieristi l'anno, che rappresentano in questo ambito il terzo posto in Europa (dopo Civitavecchia e Barcellona) e il primato assoluto come home port (porto capolinea). A questi ne potrei aggiungere molti altri. Mi limiterò a quelli più eclatanti. Nel decennio 2002-2012, il numero dei crocieristi a Venezia è aumentato mediamente del 13,1 per cento ogni anno, con un trend che, seppur contenuto, resterà positivo anche per il prossimo triennio. Il porto di Venezia è quindi diventato strategico per l'intero comparto crocieristico europeo: l'89 per cento di tutto l'incremento dei passeggeri registrato nell'ultimo decennio è imputabile a tale tipologia di traffico. Questa caratteristica determina una domanda per beni e servizi locali certamente maggiore di quella che si avrebbe se le navi si limitassero a transitare nel porto veneziano. Lo sviluppo della crocieristica veneziana è essenzialmente imputabile proprio alla crescita del traffico relativo a navi di stazza superiore alle 40.000 tonnellate. Nel 2012, il 93,6 per cento dei passeggeri sono giunti in città su questo tipo di navi. Il valore aggiunto locale rappresenta il 3,26 per cento del Pil del Comune di Venezia e lo 0,96 per cento di quello della Provincia. L'occupazione rappresenta il 4,1 per cento degli occupati totali del Comune di Venezia e l'1,19 per cento, di quelli dell'intera Provincia. Gli investimenti effettuati in questi anni sul porto di Venezia rappresentano un fatto che le classi dirigenti hanno l'obbligo di tenere ben presente quando si parla di costruire scenari alternativi. Nell'ultimo decennio è stato costruito, con forti sacrifici, un futuro per il turismo di questo territorio. Gettare via tutto sarebbe stato francamente delittuoso. Su un tema così articolato e complesso, per le evidenti e insostituibili ricadute appena citate, non si può quindi fare demagogia e bisogna individuare le migliori soluzioni possibili al netto di qualsiasi velleità di decrescita o di inattuali tentazioni di strumentalizzare, per non si sa bene quale interesse pseudo-ambientale, la situazione attuale per inseguire modelli di assoluta arretratezza culturale. Il risultato di tali impostazioni sarebbe stato certo: un vero disastro economico. Non a caso in questi giorni i rappresentanti del mondo dell'impresa e del lavoro della Provincia di Venezia, in un comunicato - anche in questo caso congiunto - hanno lanciato un appello a tutte le forze politiche che va nella direzione da noi proposta sin dall'inizio e mette in guardia dai rischi connessi all'adozione di scelte improvvisate. Un appello sottoscritto dai rappresentanti veneziani di Confindustria, Confcommercio, Coldiretti, Confesercenti, Cna, Confartigianato, Cgil, Cisl, Uil e Camera di Commercio. Non ascoltarli avrebbe significato ignorare completamente la realtà economica e produttiva del territorio. Il ruolo in ambito crocieristico del porto di Venezia, come ho già evidenziato citando dati e flussi turistici consolidati nell'ultimo decennio, è quello di un vero e proprio hub passeggeri del Mediterraneo. Un ridimensionamento di tale ruolo non potrebbe non avere ripercussioni dirette su tutti gli altri approdi, a cominciare da quelli che insistono sull'Adriatico, spalancando le porte ai nostri competitors stranieri, pronti a fare ponti d'oro alle compagnie di navigazione per prendere il posto di Venezia. Non si tratta quindi solo di Venezia o del Veneto, ma di tutto il bacino del Mediterraneo; quali sarebbero state, ad esempio, le conseguenze per Bari? Si dice che il valore turistico della città della laguna è tale per cui difficilmente potrebbe essere sostituita senza una perdita di attrazione delle singole offerte presenti sul mercato. Questo è fuori discussione, ma anche solo perdere - in una prospettiva di medio periodo - il ruolo di hub, per ritrovarsi magari fra qualche anno a fare i conti con una Venezia semplice meta di passaggio per le crociere nel Mediterraneo, significherebbe ridurre per infinite volte i ritorni economici e occupazionali e, allo stesso tempo, vanificare gli sforzi e gli investimenti effettuati in questi anni. È quindi necessario, da parte di tutte le forze politiche, così come da parte di tutte le organizzazioni sociali ed economiche, fare scelte lungimiranti, in grado di assicurare un vero sviluppo del turismo - e del turismo culturale in particolare - per porre l'ineguagliabile patrimonio storico, artistico e culturale veneziano al centro dello sviluppo non solo dei prossimi anni, ma dei prossimi decenni. Per questo siamo convinti che il testo che a breve voteremo sia un segnale forte e uno stimolo diretto al Governo affinché si intervenga con giudizio ed efficacia, ispirandosi a quel buon senso che si è affermato in quest'Aula e dimostrando che le nostre istituzioni sono ancora in grado di parlare al Paese, capirne le esigenze e fornire risposte concrete. Parlare di cultura, di turismo, del nostro patrimonio universale come risorse strategiche per la nostra economia - e Venezia ne è un esempio lampante - impone una responsabilità verso ogni possibile soluzione virtuosa di sviluppo. Al contrario, si sarebbe compiuto uno scempio irreparabile nei confronti di una realtà produttiva vitale, dimostrando ancora una volta agli italiani che non solo non si riesce a superare la crisi economica in corso, ma addirittura la si aggrava con misure suicide.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6569699048995972, 0.34303003549575806]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, colleghi, di che cosa parliamo quando ci occupiamo di povertà? Parafrasando Göran Therborn, un sociologo svedese, potremmo dire che la povertà, la disuguaglianza estrema, è una violazione della dignità umana. Prende molte forme e ha molte conseguenze: non raggiungere uno standard di vita, definito dalla propria società, che consenta il minimo accettabile in termini di sopravvivenza significa nei fatti morte prematura, cioè minore aspettativa di vita, salute cattiva, umiliazione, subordinazione, discriminazione, esclusione dalla conoscenza e/o da dove si svolge prevalentemente la vita sociale, impotenza, mancanza di fiducia in se stessi, di opportunità e possibilità della vita. Non è solo questione della dimensione del portafoglio, per dirla volgarmente: è un ordinamento socioculturale che riduce le capacità, il rispetto e il senso di sé della persona, così come le risorse per partecipare pienamente alla vita della comunità. Nel dibattito pubblico i dati che abbiamo citato e tutte queste indicazioni diventano sempre più conosciute e le persone sempre più consapevoli. I dati sulla povertà italiana rilevati dall'Istat ci dicono che 1.582.000 di famiglie, ovvero 4,6 milioni di persone, hanno varcato la soglia della povertà assoluta e circa 6 milioni sono in povertà relativa. Sono dati devastanti: in 10 anni, dall'inizio della crisi, l'aumento è del 155 per cento. Signora Presidente, desidero però rispondere al senatore Cioffi dicendo che noi non abbiamo abbandonato l'utopia (non lo faremo mai), ma viviamo nella realtà e la realtà ci dice che se la crisi è responsabile dell'innalzamento vertiginoso registrato, non dimentichiamo che scontiamo un'arretratezza di intervento dei legislatori che si sono succeduti negli anni e che rendono una nostra iniziativa non ulteriormente procrastinabile. È tuttavia difficile non vedere come il welfare state, che ha avuto in passato un ruolo importante, ora deve cambiare strutturalmente se vuole essere incisivo, perché a cambiare è il mondo intorno a noi. Il mutare delle forme di produzione e dell'allocazione delle risorse, della modalità nel formarsi delle ricchezze, crea società diseguali fra loro e al proprio interno, dentro il quadro della complessa e dura globalizzazione, nonché dello sviluppo tecnologico sempre più intensivo. Il disegno di legge delega che andiamo ad approvare, pur nei limiti intrinseci dello stesso e nelle difficoltà del contesto nazionale, si muove avendo presente questa cornice di riferimento, teorica e pratica. Voglio spendere due parole sul dibattito che accompagna le misure sulla povertà. In quest'anno, ma prevedibilmente ancora di più in campagna elettorale, della povertà parleremo spesso e ne parleranno i media. Seppure sul tema lavorino da anni molte associazioni, soggetti della società civile e corpi intermedi, l'incardinamento al Senato del disegno di legge n. 1148, presentato dai senatori Catalfo, Puglia e altri, ha di certo il merito di avere posto il tema con grande forza. E tuttavia, una delle ragioni per cui se ne parla e parlerà non è legata al contenuto, ma alla possibilità con cui certi politici e certi media possono manipolarne il significato, facendo credere all'opinione pubblica di proporre una cosa mentre ne stanno proponendo un'altra, perché i termini nel dibattito spesso diventano elastici ed ingannevoli. Diciamo allora chiaro che non può esserci un dibattito sul reddito di cittadinanza, perché il reddito di cittadinanza non lo propone nessuno. Il reddito di cittadinanza indica un trasferimento universale e permanente a ogni individuo, che rispetti certi requisiti minimi di appartenenza a una società, senza alcuna limitazione connessa alla condizione economica e senza alcun obbligo da assolvere per non perdere il beneficio. Per usare il classico esempio del filosofo John Rawls, esso per essere tale dovrebbe devolversi anche «a chi fa surf tutto il giorno davanti alla spiaggia di Malibù» e credo che questo non ce lo possiamo permettere e rientri nell'utopia. È detto chiaro nel testo di legge che ho citato, a pagina 4, che il reddito di cittadinanza è un modello ideale. Ciò che viene proposto concretamente - cito sempre - è un primo passo, che indirizzi le scelte politiche «verso l'adozione di un sistema volto a ridurre l'esclusione sociale e ad accrescere la possibilità di sviluppo di ciascun individuo nell'ambito della moderna società organizzata», introducendo criteri selettivi rispetto al beneficio e ai beneficiari, compresa quell'ISEE che è stata contestata. Signori, qui siamo nell'ambito del reddito di inclusione o dei vari redditi minimi, non del reddito di cittadinanza. Questo è un fatto riconosciuto e sottolineato anche nell'audizione del presidente dell'Istat. Tornando al disegno di legge di cui trattiamo, il testo Camera non si è potuto emendare per poter varare la misura nel più breve tempo possibile ed erogare i contributi nell'anno in corso. Ci sarà ulteriore possibilità di lavorarci in Commissione con i decreti attuativi. Possiamo dire tuttavia che ora, per la prima volta nella sua storia, anche il nostro Paese introduce finalmente una misura nazionale a vocazione universale: il reddito di inclusione, un sostegno economico, ovviamente, a cui si affianca però un progetto personalizzato di attivazione, realizzato dagli enti locali in rete con tutti i servizi del territorio. Una misura a carattere universale, valida per tutto il territorio nazionale che, attraverso il graduale incremento delle risorse e il principio di realtà, tenendo conto dei vincoli finanziari e della sostenibilità, istituisce un Fondo per la lotta alla povertà per un piano nazionale, a cui si andranno ad aggiungere le risorse date dall'assorbimento di alcune misure parziali già in vigore e ulteriori stanziamenti decisi con altri provvedimenti. La misura sarà rivolta, inizialmente, in via prioritaria ai nuclei familiari con figli minori o con disabilità grave, con donne in gravidanza o con disoccupati con più di 55 anni di età, secondo il principio della confluenza progressiva delle prestazioni nazionali sperimentali o una tantum già esistenti, con l'obiettivo di arrivare a coprire negli ultimi anni gradualmente tutte le persone che si trovano in povertà, superando ogni riferimento categoriale. Sulla base delle esperienze dei principali Paesi europei e del lavoro degli esperti del settore, l'accesso alla misura è regolato dalla prova dei mezzi e legato all'accettazione di progetti di reinserimento lavorativo e sociale. Nella definizione del beneficio si tiene conto della condizione economica del nucleo familiare e della sua relazione con una soglia di riferimento per l'individuazione della condizione stessa di povertà. Il progetto personalizzato di attivazione verrà realizzato dalle équipe multidisciplinari costituite dai Comuni uniti negli ambiti sociosanitari, in rete con tutti i servizi del territorio: un impianto già previsto dalla legge n. 328 del 2000, che il disegno di legge intende rafforzare e che mi pare gli amministratori sappiano che funziona. Con il provvedimento si compie una scelta precisa per assicurare l'efficacia degli interventi: puntare su una forte collaborazione tra i vari livelli istituzionali e una forte integrazione tra soggetti diversi (Comuni, centri per l'impiego, ASL, terzo settore) a livello degli ambiti distrettuali, rafforzando la rete dei servizi attraverso l'uso dei fondi europei e definendo modalità stabili di gestione associata. Dopo anni di sperimentazioni che, per ragioni diverse, non hanno mai visto il traguardo (anche a causa dell'azzeramento dei copechi attuato da voi, cari colleghi del centrodestra, quando avete tolto i soldi ai fondi per le politiche sociali), si riprende una strada a lungo interrotta, compiendo un primo passo per la costruzione di una vera misura di reddito minimo di inclusione, riallineando il nostro Paese alla visione solidale fondativa del modello europeo. Sappiamo dai dati della letteratura in argomento, come dalle pratiche già in atto altrove, che queste misure non producono il «povero pigro», come alcuni credono. Tutt'altro. È dimostrato che un sostegno continuo ed efficace, una presa in carico intelligente, promuove attivazioni familiari e personali che portano a darsi da fare per superare le difficoltà della vita. Il povero è povero. Se butta la spugna è perché la sua comunità lo scaraventa nell'angolo e lo dimentica. Certo, ci saranno problemi e difficoltà in un Paese a geometrie variabili, dove la diversità dei territori si evidenzia anche nella diversità di strutture territoriali in grado di supportare la manovra, dove la situazione economica chiede che si proceda per gradualità. Ci sarà quindi bisogno di monitorare il continuo e regolare afflusso dei fondi necessari, lo sappiamo bene. Ciò detto, contrastare questo intervento implica non solo spiegare le ragioni della differenza fra chi non vuole, passo passo, costruire una protezione sociale universale, a partire da quanto oggi si può fare, e puntare tutte le fiche su quello si vorrebbe idealmente. Significa anche dire al cittadino che aspetta - qualcosa, ma aspetta - che, non potendo dare tutto ora, decidiamo di non dare e non fare nulla. Chi lo farà saprà spiegarlo nelle piazze, nei mercati, a chi è in coda per un piatto caldo e un cappotto? Saprà spiegarlo a chi dorme nelle macchine? Noi davvero non ne saremmo capaci e, a dirla tutta, non vorremmo neanche esserlo.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.649246096611023, 0.3507539629936218]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, signor Sottosegretario, colleghi senatori, per oltre metà del Novecento, nel nostro Paese, il tema dell'estrema indigenza e della povertà, più che riguardare i singoli individui o singoli nuclei familiari, ha riguardato le condizioni normali di vita di vasti territori, se non di intere Regioni. Stiamo parlando certamente soprattutto del Meridione, ma anche di vaste zone del Centro Italia e del Nord Est. Alcuni di questi territori per molto tempo sono stati considerati tra i più poveri d'Europa e, tra gli anni Cinquanta e Settanta del secolo scorso, non soltanto per la ricostruzione post-bellica, ma soprattutto con politiche di redistribuzione del reddito legate alla crescita economica nazionale, milioni di persone uscivano dalla condizione di estrema povertà, come mai in Italia era accaduto dalla sua fondazione. Dagli anni Settanta in poi, questo ci dicono tutti i dati statistici, l'incidenza della povertà resta nel nostro Paese più o meno stabile. <p> La crisi, durata oltre sei anni, e la presenza in Italia di oltre cinque milioni di stranieri provenienti da Paesi tra i più poveri del mondo, hanno determinato, negli ultimi anni, la constatazione molto evidente di un fenomeno che può ulteriormente ampliarsi nei prossimi anni, con il rischio dello scivolamento di interi ceti, che fino a pochi anni fa avremmo definito medi, verso il baratro dell'insicurezza e dell'incertezza economica. <p> La maggiore preoccupazione riguarda un elemento che distingue le nuove povertà rispetto a quelle anche di pochi anni fa: il lavoro non è più sufficiente ad allontanare il rischio di povertà. Oggi, nel nostro Paese, si può lavorare e non avere i mezzi di sostentamento adeguati per sé e per la propria famiglia. Questo fatto non può non cambiare l'approccio che lo Stato deve avere sul problema povertà. Oggi gli interventi di ausilio socio-assistenziale per i cittadini fanno capo in larga misura ai Comuni, anche se negli ultimi anni è progressivamente aumentato il ruolo delle Regioni che hanno quasi tutte legiferato in materia di contrasto alla povertà. Nella maggior parte dei casi si tratta però di provvedimenti che potremmo definire sperimentali e comunque molto marginali, misure limitate nel tempo, con scarse dotazioni finanziarie, che non hanno mai consentito la costruzione di un sistema stabile e certo per i cittadini ed omogeneo in tutto il territorio nazionale. Solo una normativa nazionale, contenuta nella legge finanziaria del 1999, aveva previsto il cosiddetto reddito minimo di inserimento, normativa anch'essa certamente sperimentale, che stava crescendo nel corso degli anni ma che il Governo di centrodestra del 2004 aveva abbandonato per proporre strumenti diversi come quello ricordato anche stamattina della social card. Questo è più o meno il quadro nazionale sul quale è nata l'esigenza di trovare strumenti nuovi di contrasto alla povertà, e dico nuovi perché nuovi sono anche i bisogni di milioni di persone nel nostro Paese. Così nasce il disegno di legge n. 2494. Ad un quadro di strumenti sperimentali e territorialmente frazionati, si contrappone, per la prima volta, uno strumento omogeneo ed universale, strumento che nasce oggi ma che ovviamente ha bisogno di crescere nel corso degli anni ad iniziare da una ben maggiore dotazione. Quello dell'omogeneità e dell'universalità, però, mi sembra il punto preliminare ma anche il più significativo, in particolare per le prospettive di applicazione future. Non è lo Stato solidale che fa la carità a qualche cittadino ma è lo Stato che applica il secondo comma dell'articolo 3 della Costituzione, facendosi direttamente carico di rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e sociale che limitano, di fatto, l'eguaglianza tra i cittadini. Rispetto a queste ambizioni, come si pone il disegno di legge oggi in esame per contrastare la povertà e l'esclusione sociale dei cittadini? Innanzi tutto attraverso l'introduzione del reddito di inclusione, prevedendo un livello essenziale delle prestazioni da garantire in tutto il territorio nazionale, una misura universale, condizionata alla prova dei mezzi sulla base dell'ISEE, con progetti personalizzati di inclusione che non si esauriscono in mere dotazioni economiche ma riguardano anche i servizi alla persona. Fondamentale, poi, il riferimento ai nuclei familiari ed in particolare a quelli con figli minori e disabili, alle donne in gravidanza e agli ultracinquantacinquenni senza lavoro. È ugualmente importante il riordino delle prestazioni di natura assistenziale e il rafforzamento del coordinamento degli interventi in materia di servizi sociali per garantire in tutto il territorio nazionale livelli essenziali delle prestazioni. Si arriva poi alla promozione di accordi territoriali tra i servizi sociali e gli altri enti e organismi competenti per l'inserimento lavorativo, l'istruzione, la formazione, le politiche abitative e la salute in un rapporto stretto - come mai nel nostro Paese è avvenuto - tra pubblico, terzo settore e privato sociale. Signora Presidente, abbiamo oggi un provvedimento che certamente non ha la velleitaria ambizione di risolvere definitivamente un problema che ha una dimensione enorme, soprattutto se rapportato alla sua incidenza con il nostro bilancio pubblico. Senatore Cioffi, non si tratta di utopia; si tratta semmai - non so come dire - di non prendere in giro milioni di cittadini, soprattutto quelli più deboli. <p> Significa finirla con la retorica di un provvedimento salvifico che è scritto sulla carta e che però non indica dove trovare le decine e decine di miliardi di euro che dovrebbero invece sostenerlo. <p> Noi abbiamo qualche ambizione più certa e probabilmente meno velleitaria, quella di un provvedimento che ha bisogno di dotazioni decisamente più consistenti di quelle che oggi sono previste, che deve confrontarsi con l'incognita di una sua efficace applicazione nei diversi territori del nostro Paese, ma che ha il merito di associare il tema della povertà a quello dei diritti di ogni cittadino che si trovi in condizioni di estremo bisogno a non essere lasciato solo dallo Stato. <p> DONNO (<PARTY>). Voi li lasciate soli! ANGIONI (<PARTY>). Il provvedimento inizialmente si potrà rivolgere a poco più di 400.000 persone o famiglie. Si dirà che è poca cosa rispetto ai milioni di persone che ne avrebbero bisogno, ma apre, in ogni caso, una nuova strada nel nostro Paese, costruendo un sistema che responsabilizza lo Stato a farsi carico direttamente del suo funzionamento. È poco più che l'inizio di un percorso, ma con questo provvedimento oggi facciamo un significativo passo in avanti nella direzione giusta. Credo di poter dire che questo passo significativo in avanti lo facciamo nel rispetto in particolare delle fasce più deboli dei nostri cittadini ai quali ci rivolgiamo e diciamo: con le scarse risorse economiche su cui oggi lo Stato può fare oggi affidamento, questo è quanto lo Stato può fare. Tutto il resto non è utopia, ma retorica e presa in giro di questi cittadini.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5113965272903442, 0.48860353231430054]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, colleghi, ci troviamo ancora una volta in quest'Aula a trattare la questione delle banche.

E poi entreremo nel merito specifico del provvedimento in esame, come hanno già fatto altri colleghi e lo farà domani il senatore Carraro in dichiarazione di voto per il nostro Gruppo. La verità è che c'è una sofferenza bancaria. <p> Il provvedimento in esame è fatto male e, lo diciamo immediatamente. Tra le altre cose, è stata posta la questione di fiducia e mai ci potremmo sentire di dare la fiducia a questo Governo, che tanto male sta facendo, come ha fatto male il Governo del premier abusivo precedente, Renzi. Infatti, le cose vanno male, e le banche vanno male perché va male l'economia e il Governo non fa nulla per aiutare l'economia e l'occupazione. Le banche vanno male per due motivi. Oggi stiamo parlando di due banche venete, la Banca Popolare di Vicenza e Veneto Banca, che rappresentano quello che viene definito il triangolo d'oro del Paese: Padova, Vicenza e Treviso, ovvero la locomotiva del Nord-Est. Oggi non stiamo parlando del Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), che è stato gestito dalla politica di sinistra. Stiamo parlando di banche che, insieme ad altri istituti bancari, sono quelli del ricco Nord-Est. Ci sarà, dunque, un motivo se le cose vanno male. Certamente alcune cose sono state fatte male e si parla dei colpevoli. Ho visto che oggi il ministro Padoan ha dichiarato che bisogna che paghino i responsabili. A me pare francamente pleonastico doverlo dire. È evidente che i responsabili, laddove ci sono, debbano pagare. Mi stupisco però che un Ministro del Governo, nel giorno in cui si discute in quest'Aula del provvedimento in esame, su cui domani sarà votata la questione di fiducia, debba specificare una cosa di questo tipo. L'onestà è infatti un prerequisito ed è una condizione necessaria, ma non sufficiente, perché poi bisogna fare bene le cose. Come dicevo, le cose vanno male per le banche perché o si prestano soldi a persone e aziende che non dovrebbero averli, o perché persone che erano solvibili non sono più in grado di rispettare gli impegni presi. Laddove ci siano profili di questo tipo, ci penserà la magistratura. E le cose vanno male perché l'economia non va e il quadro generale del Paese ci dice che soltanto la Grecia e Cipro in Europa vanno peggio di noi. In Germania l'economia tira: a tal proposito vediamo cosa hanno fatto in Germania e in Gran Bretagna per le banche. Non possiamo pensare di venire qui a discutere soltanto di Veneto Banca e di Banca Popolare di Vicenza: si discuta del sistema. Chi ha parlato prima di me ha ricordato che in quest'Aula abbiamo discusso del Monte dei Paschi di Siena e delle quattro banche, compresa Banca Etruria. C'è dunque un problema di sistema generale. Se l'economia non tira, mi chiedo dove siano i provvedimenti presi dal Governo per farla ripartire: siamo allo zero virgola. L'occupazione non aumenta: pensiamo al flops act, che avrebbe dovuto portare al rilancio dell'economia. Non a caso lo chiamo flops act e non jobs act : non c'è nulla! Vorrei ricordare che nel 2011 la percentuale di disoccupazione italiana era del 2 per cento inferiore rispetto al livello medio europeo, che era ben più basso di quello attuale. Oggi, a causa della crisi, il livello di disoccupazione in tutta Europa si è alzato e l'Italia non sta più sotto, ma si trova a un livello di disoccupazione superiore del 2 per cento rispetto alla media europea. L'Italia è maglia nera anche per quel che riguarda l'occupazione e sarebbe facile parlare della disoccupazione giovanile. C'è dunque un Governo che non fa nulla, viene in Aula e pone la questione di fiducia. Poi avrà anche il coraggio di andare nei territori e dire: «Vi abbiamo salvato». Secondo voi c'è qualcuno del nostro Gruppo, qui presente in Aula, che non pensi alle 200.000 famiglie che hanno i depositi in quelle banche? C'è qualcuno che non pensa alle 100.000 imprese esposte? Credo che la cifra fosse di circa 26 miliardi di euro. Se la banca fosse fallita, cosa avrebbero fatto le imprese e il Fondo interbancario, che deve garantire i depositi fino a 100.000 euro, con la situazione delle banche che conosciamo e con l'andamento dei titoli in borsa di cui siamo a conoscenza? Non sentiamo parlare di queste cose. Tra l'altro, il provvedimento è gravemente tardivo come d'altronde gli altri. Se, infatti, fossimo intervenuti prima, avremmo aiutato tanti risparmiatori, pensionati e famiglie che hanno investito nelle azioni che hanno perso il 98 per cento del loro valore o si sono azzerate perché l'Europa il 23 giugno ha detto che c'era il dissesto finanziario di quegli istituti. Qua, però, si fa finta di niente e si dice di aspettare il cavallo bianco di Robin Hood, di cui parlavo prima, e cioè il Governo, che sistema tutto. Le cose non stanno così. Siccome parliamo di banche venete, in Veneto si dice che in questo caso la toppa è peggio del buco. Il fatto che il provvedimento è obbligatorio e ineludibile, ma è fatto male e, per di più, si pone la fiducia, che noi non ci siamo mai sentiti di dare e non ci sentiamo di dare neanche oggi a questo Governo, perché fatto di dilettanti allo sbaraglio, se la si vuole veder bene. Se si fosse intervenuti prima, non si sarebbero dovute mettere le cifre attuali. Siccome i numeri non hanno colore politico, non possiamo discutere delle cifre. Possiamo ricordarle male: forse per MPS sono stati messi più miliardi di quelli ricordati prima, ma cambia poco. Si tratta di circa 8 miliardi. Qui se ne garantiscono subito 5 e 1,2 per il personale alla chiusura degli sportelli e fino a 12 miliardi di garanzia. Sulle sofferenze bancarie la percentuale che viene messa in carico mi sembra sia circa il 50 per cento. Precedentemente, per MPS la percentuale di carico era del 20 per cento circa. Anche su questo ci sarebbe da fare un po' di chiarezza. Non si arriverà a mettere quei 12 miliardi, perché dovrebbe andare tutto male, ma si poteva mettere molto prima se si fosse intervenuti in tempo. Non ho sentito una parola da parte del relatore sugli organi di vigilanza. Il Tesoro cosa ha fatto fino ad oggi? Padoan oggi ci ha detto - lo ripeto - che bisogna punire duramente. Ma fino ad oggi dove viveva? Questo Governo o, meglio, questa maggioranza di sinistra - non voglio caricare il premier Gentiloni Silveri, che ha ereditato tutto ciò che di male è stato fatto anche dal Governo precedente - e il <PARTY> che hanno governato questo Paese fino ad oggi dove sono stati? Ci svegliamo oggi? Ha dovuto dirci l'Europa il 23 giugno che c'era il dissesto di quelle banche? Non si poteva pensare di fare prima e meglio? Io sono medico e mi chiedo: abbiamo aspettato le metastasi in giro per il corpo di questi istituti per pagare di più e non aiutare le famiglie e le imprese che costituiscono il tessuto connettivo di questo Paese, la locomotiva a Nord-Est del nostro Paese? Non è stato fatto nulla. Ciò che si fa oggi è un intervento che evidentemente non poteva penalizzare di più le famiglie e le imprese del Nord-Est, le persone che hanno messo le loro risorse nelle banche territoriali venete? Io provengo dal Veneto e posso dirvi che lì c'è una forte identificazione con le banche del territorio. Volevamo penalizzarli ancora di più, dopo che pensionati e famiglie hanno visto azzerare il valore dei loro titoli azionari di quelle banche? Volevamo anche dir loro che non garantivamo neanche più i loro depositi se in possesso di qualcosa di più di 100.000 euro oppure volevamo dire alle imprese venete di restituire subito? Dico un'altra cosa per inciso, perché il Governo è riuscito a fare anche questo. Il Governo precedente o, anzi, questa maggioranza - non voglio riferirmi al Governo - che è la stessa che c'era prima aveva detto che avremmo pagato tutti i debiti della pubblica amministrazione. Dovevano essere già pagati e, invece, neanche il 40 per cento è stato reso a quel tessuto sociale che in Veneto mantiene l'economia italiana. La piccola e media impresa, che è la spina dorsale dell'economia del Paese, per la gran parte risiede del cosiddetto ricco Nord-Est, che purtroppo oggi non è più ricco, anche perché questo Governo, al di là delle crisi internazionali che ci sono state e che riconosciamo, negli ultimi cinque anni non ha varato un solo provvedimento per aiutare l'economia.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5568437576293945, 0.44315630197525024]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, chiedo che gli ordini del giorno vengano votati insieme all'articolo 15 poiché, pur se condivisibilissimi nel contenuto, nella formulazione soffrono un poco.

Certo, alcuni risultati sono stati ottenuti sia in termini di rigore che di risanamento dei conti e anche sulla crescita finalmente si stima un possibile superamento della soglia dell'1 per cento. <p> Ma lo stesso relatore ha dovuto ammettere che non riusciamo a proporre soluzioni più forti, in grado veramente di raggiungere alcuni obiettivi sperati nel nostro Paese, in termini occupazionali, di rilancio del nostro sistema produttivo, di innovazione, di socialità. L'economia si troverà di fronte, come ha detto il relatore, alla necessità di sterilizzare le clausole di salvaguardia e di anticipare il possibile aumento dei tassi, a seguito di una diversa politica che la Banca centrale europea dovrà necessariamente portare avanti. <p> Per questi motivi, cari colleghi, l'economia continua a crescere poco. La povertà e il ceto medio continuano a subire la crisi senza veri segnali di ripresa, di fiducia e di benessere; il debito continua a crescere. Mettiamola così: il nostro Paese è come un pesante aeroplano, una sorta di cargo, che nella crisi degli anni passati è riuscito ad atterrare, limitando gli effetti sociali ed economici rispetto ad altri Paesi, nonostante la pista fosse piena di buche. La pista era piena di buche per via della burocrazia, per via della corruzione, per via dell'incapacità di produrre innovazione di prodotto e di processo, per via della scarsa patrimonializzazione delle nostre imprese, per via dell'instabilità politica del nostro sistema istituzionale. Ma al momento del decollo questo cargo non riesce ad alzarsi. Questo è il momento attuale: sembra che rulli molto in pista ad ogni finanziaria, ma poi niente. Sembra che provi a decollare, ma poi puntualmente niente. Di spiccare il volo ancora non se ne parla. <p> Questa è la storia, ormai lunga, della seconda Repubblica. È mancata una bussola orientativa per raggiungere la meta delle mete, il 3 per cento di crescita del <PARTY>L, l'unica vera soglia in grado di produrre crescita e risanamento. Sono mancati, in questa bussola, due particolari punti cardinali: uguaglianza e Stati Uniti d'Europa. Uguaglianza, sì è così, è un valore ancora regolativo, attuale e moderno. Un esempio su tutti: il cuneo fiscale. Colleghi, siamo riusciti finalmente a trovare una sintesi comune nella diagnosi intorno alla validità di questa proposta, ma siamo divisi e incerti sulla copertura finanziaria. Oltre al recupero dell'evasione dell'IVA, è stata proposta una soluzione, che finalmente ha trovato attento anche il riluttante ministro Padoan: si tratta della web tax. Il commercio e le transazioni economiche hanno sulle spalle un alto peso fiscale; sul web si sposta l'economia e si vive la nuova commercializzazione dei prodotti, ma il carico fiscale rimane risibile. Cari colleghi, anche gli Stati Uniti d'Europa sono una pista importante, un punto cardinale cui ancora non siamo riusciti a trovare spazio dentro di noi e nello stesso dibattito pubblico europeo. Così com'è l'Europa non va bene, va in frantumi, rischia la sua fine. Tornare indietro è peggio, pericoloso e disastroso; restare così è altrettanto sbagliato. La proposta di procedere verso un'Europa a due velocità è sterile e inconcludente, come l'attuale nostra politica economica. Solo con gli Stati Uniti d'Europa si potranno negoziare i debiti sovrani e si potrà impostare una politica espansiva, in cui l'Italia potrà liberare tutte le sue potenzialità, insieme agli altri Paesi ad alto debito pubblico.

Più nel dettaglio, la lettera a) del comma 1 inserisce, tra i delitti contro la personalità internazionale dello Stato, due nuove fattispecie: il delitto di finanziamento di condotte con finalità di terrorismo (articolo 270- quinquies.l) e il reato di sottrazione di beni o denaro sottoposti a sequestro (articolo 270- quinquies.2). L'articolo 270- quinquies.1, primo comma, punisce con la reclusione da sette a quindici anni chiunque raccoglie, eroga o mette a disposizione beni o denaro, in qualunque modo realizzati, destinati - in tutto o in parte - al compimento di atti con finalità terroristica. La fattispecie penale trova applicazione al di fuori delle ipotesi di associazione con finalità di terrorismo già previste dall'articolo 270- bis del codice penale e di organizzazione di trasferimenti con finalità di terrorismo ai sensi dell'articolo 270- quater.1 e indipendentemente dall'effettivo utilizzo dei fondi raccolti. Il secondo comma della nuova disposizione codicistica punisce con la pena della reclusione da cinque a dieci anni chiunque deposita o custodisce i beni o il denaro destinati al compimento di atti con finalità terroristica. L'articolo 270- quinquies.2 sanziona con la pena detentiva da due a sei anni e con la multa da 3.000 a 15.000 euro, chiunque sottrae, distrugge, disperde, sopprime o deteriora beni o denaro sottoposti a sequestro per prevenire il finanziamento del terrorismo internazionale. La lettera b) del comma 1 dell'articolo 4 inserisce nel codice penale l'articolo 270- septies, con il quale è resa obbligatoria, in caso di condanna o patteggiamento per uno dei delitti con finalità di terrorismo previsti dal codice, la confisca delle cose che servirono o furono destinate a commettere il reato e delle cose che ne costituiscono il prezzo, il prodotto o il profitto. Se la confisca di tali beni non è possibile, la disposizione autorizza la confisca per equivalente, cioè la confisca di altri beni di cui il reo ha la disponibilità, per un valore corrispondente a tale prezzo, prodotto o profitto. La confisca non potrà riguardare i beni che appartengono a terzi estranei al reato. La lettera c) del comma 1 inserisce tra i delitti contro la personalità interna dello Stato la nuova fattispecie penale di atti di terrorismo nucleare (articolo 280- ter ). La disposizione, al primo comma, punisce con la reclusione da sei a dodici anni, chiunque con finalità di terrorismo procura a sé o ad altri materia radioattiva o crea un ordigno nucleare o ne viene altrimenti in possesso. L'articolo punisce poi con la reclusione non inferiore a quindici anni chiunque, con le medesime finalità, utilizza materia radioattiva o un ordigno nucleare o utilizza o danneggia un impianto nucleare, così da rilasciare o con il concreto pericolo che rilasci materia radioattiva (secondo comma). Il terzo comma sanziona con le medesime pene le analoghe condotte aventi ad oggetto materiali o aggressivi chimici o batteriologici. L'articolo 5 modifica la lettera a) del comma 2 dell'articolo 8 del decreto-legge antiterrorismo del 2015. Tale disposizione stabilisce che il personale dei Servizi di informazione e sicurezza interna ed esterna, analogamente alla polizia giudiziaria, è autorizzato a condotte previste dalla legge come reato, anche in relazione a una specifica serie di delitti con finalità di terrorismo, operando nei loro confronti la speciale causa di non punibilità di cui all'articolo 17 della legge 3 agosto 2007, n. 124. Il disegno di legge inserisce fra i reati di terrorismo richiamati dalla disposizione anche il nuovo delitto di finanziamento di condotte con finalità di terrorismo (articolo 270- quinquies ). L'articolo 6 individua nel Ministero della giustizia il punto di contatto, ai fini della Convenzione di New York del 2005, per la soppressione di atti di terrorismo. I successivi commi recano una serie di obblighi informativi in capo al pubblico ministero con riguardo ai procedimenti penali per il delitto di atti di terrorismo nucleare, di cui all'articolo 280- ter del codice penale. In relazione a tali procedimenti, il pubblico ministero deve comunicare al Ministro della giustizia l'esercizio dell'azione penale e l'esecuzione di una misura di custodia cautelare, allegando copia dell'ordinanza. Inoltre, l'autorità giudiziaria è tenuta a comunicare l'esito definitivo del procedimento, mentre, a sua volta, il Ministro della giustizia deve comunicare l'esercizio dell'azione penale, l'esito del procedimento e l'adozione della misura cautelare agli Stati parte della Convenzione, tramite il Segretario Generale delle Nazioni Unite. Dell'ubicazione e della conservazione dei beni sequestrati è data comunicazione anche al direttore generale dell'Agenzia internazionale per l'energia atomica. L'articolo 7 disciplina la sorte dei materiali radioattivi, degli impianti nucleari o degli ordigni nucleari sequestrati nell'ambito di un procedimento penale per atti di terrorismo nucleare, prevedendo che l'autorità giudiziaria debba informare del sequestro il prefetto e il Ministero della giustizia. Il prefetto, a sua volta, informati il Ministro dell'interno, il Ministro dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare e il Ministro della salute, oltre al Dipartimento della protezione civile della Presidenza del Consiglio, deve adottare, su parere dell'ISIN, i provvedimenti necessari alla messa in sicurezza dei materiali radioattivi. Nei casi in cui i materiali radioattivi debbano essere restituiti a uno Stato parte della citata Convenzione di New York, il Ministro dello sviluppo economico vi provvede di concerto con il Ministro dell'interno, il Ministro della giustizia e il Ministro dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare. Infine, l'articolo 8 introduce nel decreto legislativo 17 marzo 1995, n. 230, di attuazione di una serie di direttive Euratom in materia di sicurezza nucleare, l'articolo 156- bis, che demanda ad un decreto del Ministro dello sviluppo economico, di concerto con il Ministro dell'interno, il Ministro dell'ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare, il Ministro della salute e il Ministro delle infrastrutture e dei trasporti, previo parere dell'ISIN, l'individuazione di un elenco di sostanze radioattive e delle modalità di loro gestione e impiego, sulla base delle raccomandazioni dell'Agenzia internazionale per l'energia.

Signor Presidente, ho ascoltato sia le motivazioni del collega Uras sia quelle del senatore Paolo Romani. Sottolineo che sull'argomento la confusione è determinata dall'assenza protratta da parte del Governo di una linea chiara. Infatti, i «visti», i «considerato» e i presupposti impegnano il Governo alla chiarezza su un argomento relativamente alla legge disapplicata del 1993; ad oggi, però, dopo una discussione che si è protratta a lungo, anche nella precedente legislatura, non si è trovato un punto di riscontro. Ciò indubbiamente determina innanzitutto uno sbilanciamento tra i poteri dell'Esecutivo e quelli del Parlamento e poi sottolinea la necessità di ristorare un comparto penalizzato per la disapplicazione di una legge che è stata votata dal Parlamento stanziando appositamente risorse economiche. Sottolineo nel merito che nella passata legislatura, per più volte, ho aderito alla richiesta del Governo di trasformare gli ordini del giorno (mi pare che nella scorsa legislatura ne sia stato firmato uno anche dal collega Vita).

La recessione che più ci preoccupa è quella demografica: il blocco delle nascite è il vero dramma del nostro Paese. Proprio perché il futuro dei nostri figli e dell'Italia viene prima dei vincoli decisi da altri, la riduzione delle tasse sarà il nostro obiettivo finale. <p> Intanto con il decreto crescita interveniamo sulle direttrici d'azione che riguardano, da un lato, il potenziamento degli investimenti pubblici e privati e, dall'altro, l'implementazione degli incentivi e degli sgravi fiscali alle imprese e ai cittadini, compreso il potenziamento della tutela del made in Italy. Tra le altre, voglio ricordare alcune misure cardine del decreto-legge, come la reintroduzione del maggior ammortamento per i beni strumentali nuovi: un'agevolazione che consente di aumentare del 30 per cento il costo di acquisizione, ai fini fiscali, degli investimenti in beni materiali strumentali nuovi. C'è poi l'aumento della deducibilità dell'Imu per le imprese, che riduce la pressione fiscale sulle imprese stesse: la deducibilità raggiungerà il 70 per cento nel 2022 e arriverà al 100 per cento nel 2023. Un intervento degno di nota è rappresentato anche dalla definizione della mini-Ires. Infatti, al fine di favorire la patrimonializzazione delle imprese, è stato semplificato il meccanismo di fruizione del beneficio attraverso l'applicazione di un'aliquota ridotta sugli utili non distribuiti. A differenza della normativa attuale, che prevede una riduzione del 9 per cento su specifici investimenti incrementali rispetto al passato, la modifica prevede una semplice riduzione di aliquota su utili non distribuiti - nei limiti dell'incremento di patrimonio netto, ad esclusione delle banche - collegata al solo reimpiego degli stessi. Ugualmente importante è la previsione a regime - perché ora prevista per gli anni 2019 e 2020 - della riduzione dei premi e dei contributi per l'assicurazione obbligatoria contro gli infortuni sul lavoro e le malattie professionali, ossia i contributi INAIL. Riguardo agli investimenti pubblici, agiamo accelerando l'utilizzo di risorse già stanziate su investimenti privati, rimuovendo i vincoli di carattere regolatorio, rimodulando gli stanziamenti e incentivando l'attività di ricerca pubblica e privata. L'obiettivo sul fronte degli investimenti pubblici è rilanciare la spesa delle amministrazioni pubbliche, che da oltre dieci anni si è progressivamente ridotta. Per questo sono previsti interventi sulle procedure di realizzazione delle opere volte a utilizzare risorse già destinate e lo stanziamento a favore dei Comuni di 500 milioni di euro per piccoli investimenti di rapida esecuzione finalizzati alla messa in sicurezza delle infrastrutture, degli edifici e dell'efficientamento energetico. L'articolo 7- ter è molto importante per le piccole e medie imprese del settore edile perché prevede specifiche condizioni di accesso alla sezione speciale del Fondo di garanzia per le piccole e medie imprese. La crisi del settore edile ha ridotto il rating da parte delle banche per queste aziende, mettendole in difficoltà per l'accesso al credito. Una delle misure più importanti è poi il sisma bonus, per favorire gli interventi antisismici anche per gli immobili posseduti da soggetti che non hanno la liquidità necessaria per anticipare tali spese, viene esteso alle zone 2 e 3 di rischio sismico, mentre oggi è previsto solo per gli edifici di zona 1. Questo beneficio consente la detrazione fiscale del 75 per cento in caso di miglioramento di una classe della classificazione energetica e dell'85 per cento del prezzo di acquisto dell'unità immobiliare in caso di passaggio di due classi. Il decreto crescita favorisce una serie di sgravi e incentivi fiscali e di rilancio di investimenti privati, prevede norme per la tutela del made in Italy e altre misure per il sostegno della crescita. Sono tutte misure che sono sempre state auspicate da questa maggioranza e che finalmente oggi si concretizzano. Il decreto-legge rappresenta per noi un'opportunità di crescita e di rilancio dell'economia. Prima di concludere, Presidente, in termini di crescita vorrei ricordare la bella vittoria dell'assegnazione delle Olimpiadi 2026 a Milano-Cortina. <p> È il risultato del grande lavoro fatto da chi a questo obiettivo ha sempre creduto. Le amministrazioni regionali di Veneto e Lombardia, guidate da Zaia e Fontana, hanno ricevuto il giusto riconoscimento del grande lavoro svolto e per averci creduto fino in fondo. I complimenti vanno anche ai due sindaci delle città Ghedina e Sala per aver condiviso sforzi e entusiasmo, ma fondamentale è stato il contributo di Giancarlo Giorgetti nell'essere riuscito a coinvolgere il Governo in questa meravigliosa avventura, che ha permesso di gridare alla vittoria tutta l'Italia, che da questo evento può trovare lo spunto e l'entusiasmo per far ripartire tutto il Paese. <p> Non posso che manifestare tutta la mia gioia per la grande opportunità che questo evento può dare al nostro Paese. Le manifestazioni sportive di respiro internazionale sono una possibilità di sviluppo e di crescita per il Paese se pensate e pianificate come opportunità di costruzione e potenziamento di infrastrutture rimpiegabili e riqualificabili ad uso civile quotidiano. È stata proprio questa la marcia in più che ha reso possibile la vittoria del nostro Paese. Non si tratta, dunque, soltanto di un evento che porta ancora una volta lustro e prestigio all'Italia, ma anche di una possibilità di sviluppo di un piano sostenibile che accrescerà l'occupazione e i consumi, non soltanto fino alla realizzazione dell'evento lasciando buoni frutti usufruibili e tangibili a tutti i cittadini. <p> Concludo sottolineando l'attenzione che la Lega ha nei confronti dei cittadini e delle imprese. Il provvedimento ne è la prova perché ci permetterà di raggiungere l'obiettivo di andare incontro alle esigenze degli italiani e delle nostre imprese, nella speranza che si possa ricreare un rapporto di fiducia tra lo Stato e i cittadini. <p> .

Bisogna prenderne atto, fare mea culpa e procedere con azioni necessarie per cambiare lo stato dei fatti, come ci chiedono cittadini e imprese. Faccio parte di un Gruppo parlamentare - Forza Italia - che non si è mai astenuto dal far notare determinati bug di sistema e ha sempre lavorato per fornire soluzioni concrete, ora più che mai con i nostri Ministri e Sottosegretari, che stanno svolgendo un lavoro egregio.

Senza il lavoro di questo Esecutivo, il rischio sarebbe stato di spendere solo il 48 per cento delle risorse del Piano nazionale di ripresa e resilienza. Fornisco qualche numero in modo da essere più chiara. La burocrazia costa alle imprese italiane 57 miliardi di euro l'anno e questo è un vero e proprio limite alla piena espressione del nostro potenziale economico. A causa della troppa burocrazia, dalla quale derivano inefficienze e scarsa qualità, l'Italia perde ogni anno 70 miliardi di euro di <PARTY>L. È quindi evidente che un intervento volto a limitare questi sprechi sia ora più che mai essenziale, alla luce dello sforzo economico che si richiederà alle future generazioni. Il decreto-legge in esame, rendendo possibile l'anticipo di 25 miliardi di euro dei fondi europei in arrivo, è la garanzia che l'Italia dovrà procedere in velocità, senza pregiudicare le legittime tutele per le imprese. Il cambio di passo è evidente: dimezzati i tempi delle valutazioni ambientali, semplificate le procedure autorizzative che riguardano anche la produzione di energia da fonti rinnovabili e ridotte le attese per le autorizzazioni per la banda ultralarga. Si accelerano gli appalti e le realizzazioni di importanti opere strategiche per l'intero Paese, semplificando, tra l'altro, le procedure per le opere di impatto rilevante (penso, ad esempio, all'alta velocità sulla tratta Salerno-Reggio Calabria). Infine, il Governo ha mantenuto la promessa di sbloccare il superbonus del 110 per cento, che è un importante incentivo per l'efficientamento energetico e gli interventi antisismici sugli edifici. Riguardo agli interventi antisismici, in particolare relativi agli edifici pubblici, faccio una richiesta all'Esecutivo. Qualche mese fa si è concluso il quadriennio del finanziamento per gli interventi di adeguamento antisismico degli edifici scolastici e diverse sono le amministrazioni che, a causa degli evidenti rallentamenti degli iter burocratici causati anche dalla situazione emergenziale ancora in atto, sono decaduti dal finanziamento. Chiedo quindi ai rappresentanti del Governo qui presenti uno sforzo al fine di superare questa difficoltà burocratica e consentire di utilizzare il denaro stanziato fino all'ultimo centesimo. Così facendo, consentiremo ai nostri figli, a partire dal prossimo anno accademico, di studiare in luoghi più sicuri. Naturalmente è tutto da considerarsi come un primo importante passo in direzione della complessa semplificazione della macchina burocratica che attendiamo ormai da troppo tempo. A questo - ne sono certa - seguiranno altri concreti e incisivi provvedimenti per far ripartire il nostro Paese in una carreggiata senza deviazioni o inversioni di marcia. La corsa dell'Italia non dovrà più arrestarsi.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5231090784072876, 0.47689089179039]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, vorrei brevemente aggiungere alcune considerazioni a quelle contenute nel testo della relazione. <p> Il disegno di legge intende costruire le condizioni migliori per festeggiare degnamente il centocinquantesimo anniversario dalla morte di Gioachino Rossini, avvenuta a Parigi il 13 novembre 1868. Non credo sia necessario dilungarmi sulle ragioni che stanno dietro questa vasta volontà, tant'è universalmente noto a tutto il mondo Gioachino Rossini, così come il contributo da lui dato alla musica e alla cultura del nostro Paese e del mondo intero. <p> Mi limito a dire poche cose, rimandando per gli aspetti più organizzativi alla lettura della relazione collegata al disegno di legge. <p> Gioachino Rossini è stato sicuramente una figura eccelsa della creatività culturale e artistica dell'Italia; uno dei massimi esponenti della nostra tradizione lirica, ancora oggi invidiata nel mondo, e fattore dell'attrattività italiana, insieme a tante altre componenti. Rossini è stato un musicista originale, imprevedibile, per certi aspetti inafferrabile; un mix di arguzia e profondità, di buonumore e di slanci eroici. Ha saputo interpretare come pochi un tempo e un Paese. Ha interpretato il primo Ottocento e i suoi mutamenti. Dopo l'era classicista, dopo l'epopea di Haydn, Mozart e Beethoven, c'era una domanda di nuove emozioni, di nuove sensibilità; una richiesta di rappresentare idee e personaggi diversi, nuovi, e Rossini lo ha fatto, facendo parte di un movimento che poi ha portato al pieno dispiegarsi del Romanticismo musicale in Germania e in tutta Europa. Ha poi interpretato le doti dell'Italia, degli italiani e del loro carattere: la fantasia, l'allegria, la capacità di satira, la voglia di cantare, e anche i buoni sentimenti, gli ideali, le passioni grandi su temi grandi. Da «Il barbiere di Siviglia» al «Guglielmo Tell», a «La Cenerentola», all'«Otello», a «L'italiana in Algeri», a «Tancredi», non hai mai dimenticato le sue grandi realizzazioni sacre. Penso ai due vertici assoluti: «Stabat Mater» e «Petite messe solennelle»: opere della maturità e della vecchiaia. In conclusione, le celebrazioni saranno utili sicuramente a ripercorrere la straordinaria parabola creativa di Rossini, ma sperabilmente anche ad altro. Penso essenzialmente a un affiancamento, importante e positivo per l'attività del Rossini opera festival di Pesaro, a cui va il nostro plauso per essere diventato ormai uno degli appuntamenti culturali annuali più importanti del nostro Paese; e ciò per provare a recuperare e valorizzare i documenti, gli archivi, i luoghi rossiniani che rappresentano comunque lo spaccato di un periodo significativo nella vita del nostro territorio, e più in generale a stimolare una nuova attenzione per l'opera lirica italiana in tutte le sue forme: quella comica, semiseria, seria, eroica, tragica. Rossini le ha visitate e praticate tutte e per questo è uno dei grandi nel pantheon della musica e della cultura italiana e mondiale. Vorrei concludere con l'auspicio che, accanto alle celebrazioni rossiniane, quest'anno, insieme alle altre realizzazioni fatte nel campo della cultura, possiamo mettere nel carniere anche altre realizzazioni significative, tra le quali vorrei citare la riorganizzazione del mondo dei conservatori e della formazione musicale, tanto attesa oggi nel nostro Paese.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5682553648948669, 0.43174460530281067]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> D'ANNA (<PARTY>).

Dobbiamo quindi ricordare il contributo del ministro degli affari esteri Gaetano Martino, che promosse e presiedette la Conferenza di Messina, e quello del presidente del Consiglio Antonio Segni, nonché di diplomatici di altissimo livello, tra i quali in particolare Roberto Ducci, che fu Presidente del Comitato di redazione dei Trattati di Roma sotto la guida del primo ministro belga Spaak. È stato un esempio che dobbiamo ricordare, ma soprattutto è stata una storia di successivi avanzamenti e conquiste che è molto importante che il Presidente del Consiglio abbia voluto così nettamente valorizzare. Sarebbe infatti il momento di ritrovare un orgoglio europeo che abbiamo perduto e l'orgoglio italiano per il contributo che abbiamo dato alla costruzione europea <p> A ciò ha richiamato tutti il presidente Mario Draghi in un bellissimo discorso come quello tenuto a Lubiana, in cui ha inoppugnabilmente dimostrato quali avanzamenti l'Europa abbia potuto compiere grazie all'integrazione e come saremmo ben più poveri ed isolati se non avessimo intrapreso quella strada. <p> Quanto a cosa possa dirci la Dichiarazione, vorrei innanzitutto - e penso che sia possibile - onorevole Presidente del Consiglio, che la Dichiarazione per il 60° anniversario riecheggi le parole drammatiche che sono state pronunciate l'altro ieri a Versailles e che sono un fatto nuovo. Abbiamo sentito il presidente Hollande e la cancelliera Merkel (le posizioni italiane erano già su quella linea) dire drammaticamente che l'Europa non può restare ferma, se non rischiando di veder crollare ciò che ha costruito, che l'Europa deve avanzare sulla via dell'integrazione, se necessario anche a diverse velocità. Credo che questo già sarebbe importante ed impegnativo e penso che si possa riuscire in ciò, perché ad un certo momento, per realismo necessario, abbiamo preso atto che nell'anno elettorale 2017 sarebbe stato vano attendersi decisioni di straordinaria portata, ma abbiamo addirittura temuto che quest'anno fosse contrassegnato, oltre che dall'inazione, dal silenzio dell'Unione. Questo non è stato e penso non debba essere quando vi riunirete qui a Roma per celebrare il sessantesimo anniversario. <p> Le parole della cancelliera Merkel prima a Malta, e poi le sue e quelle degli altri tre Capi di Stato e di Governo riuniti a Versailles possono anche considerarsi una reazione comprensibile e legittima ad un lungo esercizio di disagio e di pazienza che ci ha accompagnati nei mesi scorsi. Perché alla Brexit si è risposto, da parte dei 27 membri rimasti nell'Unione europea, con un appello all'unità, a restare tutti uniti, ma senza fare un solo passo avanti: questo è stato il prezzo che si è pagato e che giustamente oggi si dice con convinzione (non sono parole che possono scadere ventiquattro o quarantotto ore dopo la riunione di Versailles) che fermi non si può restare e che bisogna andare avanti in una direzione precisa: quella dell'ulteriore e più coerente sviluppo del processo d'integrazione. <p> Naturalmente, sappiamo che non tutti i 27 condividono il fine, i traguardi e le modalità o la velocità di avanzata su quel terreno. C'è anche qualcosa di più di cui dobbiamo essere consapevoli. Ieri sera al telegiornale ho sentito e visto - e penso di non essere stato il solo - parole ed immagini che mi hanno profondamente impressionato: le parole di allarmismo xenofobo del Primo ministro ungherese, le immagini delle barriere, del filo spinato e di un corpo speciale di guardie anti-immigrati che caratterizzano la risposta di quel Governo al grande fenomeno delle migrazioni e alla pressione dei richiedenti asilo che invocano un diritto universalmente riconosciuto. Direi che è molto difficile capire a quale velocità e in quale direzione si possa marciare con queste posizioni che negano valori costitutivi dell'integrazione europea. <p> Le direttrici di marcia e perfino una tabella di marcia per quanto riguarda gli sviluppi da dare al processo di integrazione sono contenuti in un documento che porta la data del 22 giugno 2015, quello dei cinque Presidenti, che parte anche dalla necessità di una unione economica protesa verso politiche di crescita, di occupazione e di protezione sociale. Tra poco però scadrà la prima tappa di quella tabella di marcia e nulla si è mosso: mi chiedo se abbiano pesato negativamente più le timidezze dei Paesi che ci credono o le riluttanze e le sfide ostruttive dei Paesi che non condividono quelle direttrici di marcia. <p> Si potrà andare avanti nel senso delle diverse velocità; già è molto importante che si faccia un concreto progresso sulle politiche di difesa. Qui rimaniamo anche nel campo di una visione del Trattato, che è quella delle cooperazioni rafforzate o, anzi, in questo caso, di una cooperazione che viene definita nel Trattato di Lisbona «strutturata». Possiamo andare avanti in quella direzione e cominciare a sciogliere tutti gli altri interrogativi che riguardano anzitutto, signor Presidente del Consiglio, l'esercitare come Consiglio europeo le decisioni necessarie sfruttando tutte le possibilità di votazioni a maggioranza, non soggette al vincolo dell'unanimità o a meri assensi informali, che fanno di quelle decisioni lettera morta. Restano molteplici interrogativi da sciogliere per avanzare sulla strada già tracciata e, in particolare, su quella della politica comune per l'immigrazione e l'asilo. È rilevante il contributo che sta dando l'attuale Governo, proiettando questa politica in una prospettiva di cooperazione euro-mediterranea e di interventi congiunti per lo sviluppo dell'Africa.

Signor Presidente, con questo intervento di fine seduta continuiamo, oggi, al Senato, una staffetta con cui, assieme a tante senatrici e tanti senatori, ricordiamo ogni donna che viene uccisa per mano di un uomo a cui è o è stata legata da relazione amorosa. Lo faremo sino a quando sarà necessario ricordare al Parlamento e al nostro Paese l'urgenza di arginare la violenza nei confronti delle donne: qualsiasi tipo di violenza, fino a quella più drammaticamente estrema, che comporta la privazione della vita. Non possiamo e non vogliamo abituarci a questo. A Sassari una donna, Anna Doppiu, di sessantaquattro anni, è stata selvaggiamente picchiata dal marito, che poi l'ha bruciata ancora viva. Non se l'era sentita di denunciare il marito, da cui subiva violenze e dal quale, peraltro, aveva deciso di separarsi. Il 12 novembre, a Poggibonsi, in provincia di Siena, un'altra donna, Ionela Sandu è stata uccisa in modo barbaro dal compagno, dall'uomo con cui aveva una relazione sentimentale, dopo un litigio. È stata investita dal camion guidato dall'uomo con cui aveva questa relazione. L'uomo adesso è in stato di arresto, con l'accusa di omicidio volontario. Salgono così a 26 le donne che abbiamo ricordato in questa staffetta, iniziata solo il 30 giugno. Sono tante le persone che a Sassari, lo scorso sabato, hanno partecipato ad un flash mob in cui sono state ricordate, oltre ad Anna, le 98 donne vittime di femminicidio nel solo 2016, così come sono tantissime le persone che a Siena, in questi giorni, hanno partecipato alla fiaccolata in ricordo di Ionela. L'ISTAT ci informa che In Italia ogni 2,2 giorni viene uccisa una donna. Il 46,3 per cento delle donne uccise muore per mano del suo compagno. Il drammatico bollettino risulta ancor più grave per il fatto che le violenze fisiche e sessuali sono ulteriormente aumentate e che sono in crescita anche i casi di violenza assistita. Come dimostrano anche i casi di Anna e di Ionela, il femminicidio è quasi sempre l'estremo risultato di una serie di comportamenti violenti di lunga data. Non serve solo l'attenzione e la consapevolezza di essere di fronte ad un problema da affrontare con decisione, ma è necessario dare tutela, sostegno, risposte e aiuti concreti a tutte le donne che vivono situazioni di potenziale pericolo. Bisogna agire con severità e con un monitoraggio costante di tutte le situazioni a rischio, per non lasciarle incancrenire. Donne e uomini insieme possono fermare questa carneficina. Lo possono fare chiedendo l'applicazione rigorosa delle normative, ma avendo anche la forza di innescare quel cambio di passo, in primis culturale, che consenta di sostenere e far vivere la parità di genere dappertutto, in ogni settore, di promuovere l'educazione dei figli, nell'ambito scolastico e famigliare, al rispetto del corpo delle donne, unitamente al fatto che figlie e giovani donne devono trovare la forza di avere più rispetto per sé e per il loro corpo, denunciando la violenza fin dalle prime quasi impercettibili mosse, senza mai giustificarla. La società e le istituzioni debbono essere in grado di rispondere subito alla minima richiesta di aiuto e di assistenza. Abbiamo bisogno di una democrazia autenticamente paritaria e che affermi i diritti, per scardinare una cultura che è ancora patriarcale, per fare prevenzione, per sconfiggere stereotipi sessuali e pregiudizi, per garantire le libertà e l'autonomia di scelta nel percorso di vita delle donne. Riproponiamo con convinzione il nostro appello. Un appello alla Ministra per le pari opportunità e al Governo tutto: la cabina di regia verifichi costantemente l'applicazione, i pregi e i limiti della legge n. 119 del 2013 e, soprattutto, dia piena e accurata attuazione del piano contro la violenza. Un appello ai media : si smetta di giustificare gli assassini e di colpevolizzare le donne.

Intendo votare a favore di questo disegno di legge, pur esprimendo una forte perplessità ed una radicale insoddisfazione nei confronti dell'articolato. Spiego le ragioni di questa mia posizione, che non si limita ad alcune questioni critiche, pur rilevanti, ma riguarda l'impianto e l'ispirazione complessiva del disegno di legge. <p> In esso, a mio avviso, sono state introdotte formulazioni che depotenziano in maniera grave il senso, la prospettiva e la finalità di questa normativa, a partire dalla formulazione che prevede la reiterazione degli atti di violenza, cioè il fatto che debbano essere ripetuti perché si verifichi la fattispecie della tortura. Mi sembra un errore capitale. <p> Inoltre, tra le sanzioni previste, nella fattispecie più rilevante è introdotto l'ergastolo. E così, mentre in molte altre situazioni ed in relazione a molti altri provvedimenti, in tanti operiamo per superare il «fine pena mai», qui sbuca l'ergastolo rispetto ad una nuova fattispecie. <p> E tuttavia il motivo fondamentale di critica è un altro. Si tratta del fatto che nel provvedimento in esame la tortura non è qualificata come reato proprio, bensì come reato comune. <p> Parto da un articolo della nostra Costituzione che risulta trascurato, pur costituendo - a mio avviso - il fondamento del discorso che oggi, intorno al provvedimento in titolo, è necessario fare. Mi riferisco all'articolo 13, comma quarto, dove è stabilito che «è punita ogni violenza fisica e morale sulle persone comunque sottoposte a restrizioni di libertà». Secondo alcuni costituzionalisti, questo è l'unico luogo della nostra Carta costituzionale dove è prevista espressamente e dichiaratamente l'introduzione di un reato, che così diventa, sotto il profilo giuridico e costituzionale, obbligatorio. <p> Attenzione, il passaggio determinante di tale comma è la formula: «restrizioni di libertà». Infatti, con ciò ci si riferisce esplicitamente a una condizione dove a privare della libertà è lo Stato attraverso i suoi apparati, i suoi organismi ed i suoi uomini. <p> Ciò rimanda ad un'altra formulazione altrettanto importante, contenuta nella Convenzione delle Nazioni Unite contro la tortura del 1984, dove - appunto - il reato di tortura è qualificato come reato proprio, ovvero fattispecie imputabile a pubblici ufficiali, a funzionari dello Stato e a chi riveste a qualunque titolo autorità pubbliche. <p> Questo è il nodo essenziale che nel disegno di legge oggi in discussione viene totalmente eluso, perché il reato di tortura è previsto come reato comune, imputabile a qualunque cittadino. <p> E questo pone una questione, non solo fondamentale, ma addirittura dirimente, perché proprio nella Convenzione dell'ONU del 1984 - rispetto alla quale il nostro Paese sconta uno scandaloso ritardo di ben trent'anni - la specificità del reato di tortura è individuata e saldamente agganciata alla partecipazione, agli atti di violenza, nei confronti di quanti sono sottoposti a restrizioni di libertà, di chi è titolare di funzione pubblica. Oltre tutto, ciò è elemento essenziale del ragionamento che sta alla base del disegno di legge a firma mia e dei senatori Tronti e Corsini: mi riferisco al fatto che proprio quel fondamento essenziale dello Stato di diritto, che prevede la titolarità del monopolio legittimo della forza in capo agli organismi di polizia, è questione delicatissima. Una funzione così essenziale da richiedere il massimo equilibrio e la massima intelligenza nel suo esercizio. <p> Dunque, è non solo possibilità, ma dovere dello Stato delegittimare pubblicamente chi abusa di quel monopolio legittimo della forza. Infatti, questo è il nodo. La tortura trova la sua radice esattamente in questa categoria, cioè in quella dell'abuso di potere, dell'esercizio arbitrario ed illegale di una forza legittima, utilizzata extra legem. Se togliamo tale circostanza dall'ambito di questo ragionamento e dall'ambito concreto di questo articolato, il provvedimento in esame ne risulta fatalmente devitalizzato. Aggiungo che siamo entrati, così, nel cuore di una questione cruciale. Vorrei su questo richiamare l'attenzione perché stiamo parlando dei princìpi fondativi dello Stato di diritto e dello Stato democratico perché l'incolumità della persona e del suo corpo mentre si trovano nella custodia dello Stato, dei suoi apparati e dei suoi uomini, l'integrità fisica e psichica di quella persona e del suo corpo, a prescindere dalla biografia e dal suo curriculum (fosse anche un curriculum criminale), fonda il patto sociale e fonda l'obbligazione politica e la stessa legittimazione giuridica e morale dello Stato democratico. Tra cittadino e Stato democratico è questa l'essenza dell'obbligazione: la certezza che lo Stato garantisce l'incolumità, l'integrità fisica e psichica, tanto più quando ci si trovi sotto la sua custodia, dà forza al patto di ubbidienza verso lo Stato, e al dovere di lealtà nei suoi confronti. È su questo patto, tra garanzia di incolumità per il cittadino, e lealtà verso lo Stato che si basa l'ordinamento dello Stato democratico. Dunque, la violazione dei fondamenti di questo patto politico tra cittadino e Stato costituisce il reato più grave e non solo per umanitarismo: perché ogni vita umana è unica e irripetibile, ma proprio per le ragioni giuridico-politiche che ho esposto. Infine, io penso che l'onore dei Corpi di polizia, la dignità della divisa, l'integrità della loro immagine discendano esattamente dalla capacità dello Stato di sanzionare, in base al principio della responsabilità penale come responsabilità sempre personale, quanti violano quel patto tra il cittadino e lo Stato e si rivelano, così, servitori infedeli. Ecco allora che a difendere quella dignità e quell'onore è la capacità dello Stato, delle sue leggi e degli stessi appartenenti alle Forze dell'ordine di riconoscere come la lesione del corpo del cittadino affidato alla loro custodia sia davvero il reato più grave. E proprio perché quando il corpo del cittadino è nelle mani dello Stato quel corpo è il bene più grande e più prezioso sul quale, appunto, si fonda la legittimità dello Stato stesso. È lo Stato con le sue leggi, con l'istituzione del reato di tortura, che difende quella dignità. È lo Stato, con la sua legge sul reato di tortura, che può difendere meglio quella dignità. Non certo quei sindacatini felloni che proteggono l'omertà di coloro che hanno commesso i reati e gli omicidi per i quali sono stati condannati, arrivando ad offendere i familiari delle vittime. <p> Ecco perché, ritenendo che siamo di fronte ad una discussione importante, a trent'anni dalla Convenzione dell'ONU sulla tortura, il mio voto andrà comunque a favore di questo disegno di legge, che tuttavia, su molti punti, mi lascia insoddisfatto.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5373710989952087, 0.4626288414001465]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, rappresentante del Governo, colleghe e colleghi, il tema della discussione odierna è quanto mai importante e vitale per tante famiglie ed aziende del nostro Paese. L'aumento incontrollato dei costi energetici rischia, infatti, di avere un impatto devastante sui bilanci, soprattutto delle fasce più deboli della popolazione, direttamente ed indirettamente. Direttamente, perché con la stagione invernale alle porte i consumi per luce e riscaldamento sono destinati a crescere; indirettamente, perché l'aumento dei costi energetici per le aziende, a cascata, provocherà un aumento di prezzi dei prodotti finiti, con il risultato di impattare ulteriormente in maniera negativa sui bilanci familiari, anche solo a livello dei costi da sostenere per fare la spesa, considerata la crescita combinata e finora incontrollata dei costi alla pompa del carburante. Basta vedere, già rispetto ad un anno fa, quanto siano aumentati i prezzi al dettaglio di molti prodotti. <p> La situazione si è aggravata dopo che il costo dell'energia elettrica ha subito un deciso incremento dal secondo trimestre del 2020 all'agosto di quest'anno, passando da 16,08 a 22,89 centesimi di euro per kilowattora, stando ai prezzi del servizio di maggior tutela. Nel frattempo, però, i prezzi sono materialmente cresciuti in maniera considerevole. Basti pensare che il prezzo del petrolio è aumentato del 200 per cento dalla primavera del 2020 e quello del gas naturale del 30 per cento solo negli ultimi tre mesi. Quest'ultimo aspetto è particolarmente importante per la situazione del nostro Paese, visto che il gas naturale è impiegato per produrre il 40 per cento dell'energia elettrica. <p> Tale situazione è stata provocata da una combinazione di fattori, tra i quali la minore disponibilità di gas prodotto direttamente in Europa e la diminuzione delle forniture dalla Russia, dalla quale l'Europa è fortemente dipendente in materia energetica. <p> Senza volersi addentrare in considerazioni di ordine geopolitico, è evidente che la posizione dell'Italia è quanto mai debole, stando la notoria dipendenza energetica dalle forniture estere per coprire il fabbisogno interno. Si tratta di una condizione che in casi come questo, di aumento sconsiderato dei prezzi per effetto anche di indubbie speculazioni, accentua la fragilità della nostra economia. <p> In tal senso, l'abbandono frettoloso della produzione energetica tramite centrali nucleari si sta rivelando dannoso per il nostro Paese dal punto di vista economico. <p> Il tema delle energie rinnovabili è sfruttato sempre in maniera ideologica senza dati concreti, ma la verità è che circa il 10 per cento del consumo di energia elettrica in Italia deriva dal nucleare ed è tutta di importazione, prevalentemente dalla vicina Francia, la quale peraltro produce circa il 75 per cento della propria energia elettrica con le centrali nucleari. Noi abbiamo rinunciato a produrre energia nucleare per ragioni ambientali, ma la compriamo oltralpe, con il risultato che paghiamo qualcosa che avremmo potuto produrre in casa, senza per questo essere al riparo dai presunti rischi legati alla sua produzione. <p> Se c'è una lezione che ci deve servire per la crisi in cui stiamo dibattendoci, questa è rappresentata dal fatto che dobbiamo lavorare per ridurre il più possibile la dipendenza dalle importazioni di energia. <p> Se questo deve passare dalla reintroduzione di una produzione nucleare sfruttando le nuove tecnologie ad alta sicurezza e a basso impatto ambientale, allora è bene affrontare il tema, senza piegarsi alla propaganda strumentale dei fanatici dell'ambientalismo che, come ha detto qualcuno, provocano più danni della catastrofe climatica di cui si dibatte. <p> Il Governo, con il provvedimento di cui discutiamo oggi, ha messo in campo misure straordinarie per attenuare gli effetti dell'impennata dei prezzi di gas e luce, impegnando complessivamente molte risorse. Si tratta di cifre imponenti, ma nemmeno lontanamente sufficienti per coprire l'aumento dei prezzi dell'energia che acquistiamo dall'estero. Infatti, con il pesante sforzo economico studiato dal Governo gli aumenti previsti in bolletta saranno del 29,08 per cento per la luce e del 14,04 per il gas, impattando comunque in maniera gravosa sui bilanci di tante famiglie, ma non solo. Pensiamo, infatti, all'aumento dei costi delle altre materie prime come, ad esempio, l'acciaio e, combinandoli con gli aumenti del costo dell'energia, il risultato sarà di aumenti esorbitanti per i prodotti finali. <p> Se il costo di produzione di un auto aumenta di pari passo con quello delle sue componenti, soprattutto delle parti in plastica e in acciaio, lo stesso avverrà in misura proporzionale con il prezzo al consumatore, con il risultato di diminuire la fetta di potenziali acquirenti. Una riduzione delle vendite di auto si traduce in minor produzione e in minor lavoro in primis per gli operai delle fabbriche di assemblaggio e in seguito per le aziende della componentistica, in un circolo vizioso che potrebbe avere effetti drammatici sull'economia del nostro Paese. L'esempio del settore automobilistico potrebbe essere replicato anche per altri settori. L'incubo di una nuova brutta stagione non è così distante e ovviamente non riguarda solo il nostro Paese, ma l'intera Europa con le debite proporzioni. In questo momento le nostre aziende - parlo in particolare della mia zona, il Canavese, dove peraltro si stampa il 70 per cento dell'acciaio in Italia - stanno vivendo una fase di ripresa, dopo una stagnazione dovuta all'esplodere della pandemia. Questa fase, però, rischia di terminare ben presto se non si pone un freno alla spirale dell'aumento dei prezzi delle materie prime. In questo senso, l'Unione europea è chiamata a svolgere un ruolo straordinariamente importante per evitare, o almeno attenuare, gli effetti di una crisi economica dalle proporzioni ancora non ben definite in tutta la loro gravità. È evidente che l'Italia non può continuare all'infinito a immettere risorse per calmierare i costi dell'energia, serve una risposta strutturale per affrontare le sfide che la situazione attuale ci impone e per pianificare una strategia volta a metterci al riparo dalle dipendenze e dalle importazioni di risorse energetiche. Queste risposte non possono che venire dall'Europa, dove crediamo che il nostro Paese potrà tornare a recitare un ruolo di prim'ordine grazie anche all'autorevolezza, alla competenza e all'esperienza del nostro Presidente del Consiglio. Riguardo alle misure del giorno per contenere gli aumenti delle bollette energetiche, noi della Lega siamo sicuramente favorevoli, pur consapevoli del fatto che si tratta di un palliativo che non può risolvere da solo il problema.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6187842488288879, 0.38121575117111206]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> NASTRI (<PARTY>).

L\\'obiettivo di questo disegno di legge, di cui abbiamo parlato tantissimo nelle Commissioni, ormai quasi da due anni, è quello di contribuire al risanamento dell\\'ecosistema e alla promozione dell\\'economia circolare e, chiaramente, di favorire il recupero dei rifiuti accidentalmente pescati, com\\'è stato detto prima, per la pulizia del mare. Infine, uno degli aspetti importanti è la sensibilizzazione della collettività con la diffusione di modelli comportamentali rivolti alla prevenzione del fenomeno dell\\'abbandono di rifiuti. Non dimentichiamo che l\\'Italia è bagnata per due terzi dal mare, pertanto chi meglio di noi dovrebbe avere a cuore l\\'emergenza dei rifiuti marini? A <PARTY> piace molto quando i progetti sono ambiziosi. Ci affascinano molto meno quando questi progetti, che in teoria potrebbero essere ambiziosi, non sfruttano al meglio la loro potenzialità. Questo è sicuramente stato un handicap del disegno di legge al nostro esame, pertanto definirlo oggi salva mare è un discreto esercizio di comunicazione politica. Sicuramente, però, non rappresenta la realtà e, soprattutto, la verità. Potremmo definirlo, come ho detto spesso in Commissione, un \"pulisci mare\". Noi, proprio perché eravamo consapevoli dell\\'importanza di questo provvedimento, avevamo presentato diversi emendamenti. Proprio per accelerare l\\' iter, una parte degli emendamenti era stata ritirata. <PARTY> aveva presentato questo emendamento proprio per migliorare tutte le contraddizioni che c\\'erano - e che ci sono - all\\'interno del disegno di legge. Tra l\\'altro, voglio ricordare un punto importante, vista anche la presenza del signor Sottosegretario. Nella legge di bilancio è stata posticipata al 2023 l\\'applicazione della plastic tax. Bisognerebbe capire, intanto, qual è l\\'orientamento del Governo: plastica sì o plastica no? Non bisogna ragionare sempre in una logica punitiva attraverso tassazione, perché sicuramente questo non aiuta. Inoltre, volevo dire ai colleghi che la normativa posta in essere crea un grande paradosso, ossia che i pescatori devono pagare per lo smaltimento dei rifiuti che trovano in mare. Noi, invece, avevamo predisposto in Commissione un emendamento, insieme al collega Iannone, per stabilire un incentivo, soprattutto nei confronti degli imprenditori ittici, che potesse agevolare il recupero dei rifiuti in mare. Avevamo proposto la cifra di 40 euro per ogni quintale di rifiuti: soldi recuperati, ma non siamo stati ascoltati. Questo perché, quando si propongono soluzioni serie, chiaramente vengono bocciate. Invece di rafforzare i controlli su chi scarica abusivamente in mare, fate ricadere, come sempre, i costi sulla fiscalità generale. Bisognava trovare un sistema alternativo per la copertura dei costi relativi alla gestione dei rifiuti recuperati in mare. Perché la pulizia del mare non deve rientrare nell\\'obiettivo strategico del PNRR? In qualsiasi caso, si dice che bisogna sensibilizzare e che bisogna educare. Quello che viene detto in questo disegno di legge è che dobbiamo informare gli utenti e anche la popolazione. Facciamolo, allora, ma in maniera seria. Se si intende difendere effettivamente il discorso dell\\'ambiente, bisogna essere anche un po\\' coraggiosi e soprattutto presidenti lungimiranti nei provvedimenti legislativi. Noi speravamo che questa fosse l\\'occasione per risolvere i problemi dei rifiuti, ad esempio quelli abbandonati sulle spiagge o sulle coste, che poi vengono risucchiati in mare, ma così non è stato. Si parla sistematicamente di trovare una sinergia e anche un connubio con il mondo produttivo per il rilancio delle tematiche ambientali. Ci eravamo illusi che fosse la volta buona, ma così non è stato. Per tutti questi motivi, il nostro sarà un voto di astensione, perché è mancata la lungimiranza, ma soprattutto una strategia per poter aiutare effettivamente, con questo disegno di legge, tante persone che ne avevano bisogno.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6133303642272949, 0.38666969537734985]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, rappresentanti del Governo, onorevoli colleghi, questo provvedimento ancora una volta conferma l'incapacità, ormai consolidata, di un Governo che non sa affrontare un problema così serio e reale con soluzioni che non siano invece soltanto assurde e addirittura dannose. Soluzioni che tutto fanno al loro interno tranne essere tali. Questo significa affrontare un problema senza risolverlo. Lo sapete e lo sa il Governo: con dei palliativi e un disegno di legge che porta un nome che probabilmente maschera e nasconde quello che può essere semplicemente un indulto e una falsa soluzione al problema delle carceri, non si risolve alcunché, anzi si crea un danno al nostro Paese. <p> Il sovraffollamento non si affronta infatti svuotando le carceri e liberando detenuti con condanne per reati anche gravi, ma si contrasta con interventi che vanno nel senso della prevenzione, innanzitutto. L'unico metodo per prevenire, secondo la Lega Nord, è la certezza della pena; la serietà della certezza della pena è fondamentale. Siamo quindi assolutamente contrari a questo provvedimento e porremo in essere tutte le iniziative per contrastarlo e fermare una scelta scellerata. Il testo era già sta stato bloccato al Senato nella precedente legislatura, perché le criticità erano e sono tuttora evidenti. Diverse cose in questo testo non andavano allora e ancora meno vanno oggi. <p> Entriamo nelle tematiche che la Lega Nord considera imprescindibili, ossia sicurezza e, come già detto, certezza della pena. Stiamo parlando di reati di particolare allarme sociale, ma definiti reati minori. Se possiamo definire reati minori quelli che prevedono pene fino a cinque anni, e che saranno quindi depenalizzati. Se possiamo definire reati minori il furto, la truffa, la ricettazione, lo stalking, la violenza, perfino la pornografia minorile e - ne parlerò più avanti - l'immigrazione clandestina. Lo voglio sottolineare condividendo il pensiero di tutto il Gruppo: sono reati che comportano allarme sociale in un momento già difficile a causa di una realtà economica pesante e ormai insostenibile. La nostra gente non ha un lavoro e non arriva a fine mese, l'economia ancora non riparte, le aziende chiudono, gli imprenditori sono costretti a fare scelte drastiche. Pensiamo al Veneto, dove i suicidi sono purtroppo un fatto pesante ma quotidiano, perché molti non ce la fanno più. E noi di cosa parliamo? Il problema in questo momento non è l'economia, ma il provvedimento svuota-carceri. Sicuramente quello delle carceri è un problema e un'emergenza sociale, ma non la primaria emergenza che il Paese in questo momento sta affrontando, che invece è fuori dalle porte e che attende risposte concrete. Quindi, come dicevo, si tratta di un provvedimento errato e premiale, ma ad esclusivo beneficio di chi commette i reati. Dobbiamo smetterla con il buonismo che giustifica tutto e tutti, dando colpe alla società, che crea queste figure di disagiati, queste persone - poverine! - che non hanno altro modo di sopravvivere che non quello di commettere reati. Si tratta di una scusa assurda e offensiva per chi vive e lavora con onestà, nel rispetto delle regole e degli altri, per le persone che scelgono di vivere onestamente, pur tra mille difficoltà, senza cercare scuse per vivere nell'illegalità. Ma quale messaggio vogliamo dare con questo provvedimento? Vogliamo dire a tutto il mondo che l'Italia è un Paese in cui è possibile fare tutto, cosicché si possa dire: «Vado in Italia, tanto posso rubare e non rischio nulla, al limite qualche giorno ai domiciliari, magari anche a ore o, che ne so, a turni». Questo è il messaggio che sta uscendo: avremo una circolazione di delinquenti, a giorni o a ore alterne. Potreste anche prevedere un incentivo per il lavoro, una nuova normativa, come un part-time verticale o orizzontale a piacimento del recluso, individuando i giorni o le ore di detenzione presso il proprio domicilio. Oppure potremmo anche decidere di fare un elenco delle location di preferenza. Ma stiamo scherzando? Quale messaggio diamo a questo Paese? <p> Abbiamo visto come sia fallita la legge sull'indulto, la n. 241 del 2006, che la Lega Nord ha contrastato e su cui ovviamente non ha dato voto favorevole, dato che l'85 per cento dei beneficiati è tornato a delinquere. Possiamo dire che la Lega Nord è da sempre contraria al populismo e al buonismo, espresso per un voto, per uno scambio di preferenze o di scelte e non secondo la logica della difesa dei cittadini. <p> Pensiamo quindi agli ulteriori effetti negativi che avrà il provvedimento in esame. Dove va a finire la funzione educativa della pena, se vogliamo parlare dell'educazione e dell'inserimento di queste persone? Li educhiamo lasciando loro libertà di azione, la libertà di togliere libertà ai cittadini onesti, che in questo Paese fortunatamente sono ancora molti. Ed arriviamo alla follia di abolire il reato di immigrazione clandestina, come proposto dal <PARTY>. Mi dispiace, ma questa non può che essere definita follia: porte aperte e diritto di imbarcarsi per l'Italia, con delle conseguenze non solo economiche per il Paese, ma anche senza alcun rispetto per quelle persone che, fornite di false speranze, arriveranno in Italia, con le modalità che abbiamo visto in questi anni, cercando di fare in modo che non accada più. Arriveranno con i barconi, che andranno a fondo, e gli immigrati, con il loro sogno di raggiungere un Paese che non darà loro nulla, moriranno in mezzo al mare. Questo è quello che farete: questo è il futuro che darete a queste persone. <p> Ritengo che state sbagliando veramente tutto, alla faccia del rispetto per i cittadini, che sicuramente non vi hanno votato per avere un Paese meno sicuro, in cui la gente onesta, che da sempre vi lavora, si trova ad essere messa in fondo alla lista delle priorità. Lo ripeto: la gente vive già un momento di crisi sociale, di contrasti, di difficoltà economica. Il nostro ruolo è quello di dare sicurezza, non di esasperare il disagio, non di contrapporre queste situazioni. Il nostro compito è quello di dare lavoro e dunque non solo sgravi per assumere i detenuti, ma sgravi per assumere prima i cittadini che da sempre hanno lavorato onestamente in questo Paese. <p> Torniamo al problema del sovraffollamento delle carceri: il 40 per cento dei detenuti è costituito da extracomunitari e in alcune zone del Nord arriviamo ad una percentuale del 60 o del 70 per cento. Dobbiamo quindi farci carico di ciò? Possiamo in questo momento farci carico di ciò? Possiamo subire i reati e subire anche l'obbligo di far scontare la pena nel Paese in cui sono stati commessi, togliendo risorse ai cittadini onesti, alle famiglie e agli imprenditori? Non possiamo parlare dunque di ipocrisia nell'agire? Dobbiamo fare invece azione concrete, creare nuovamente lavoro, ridare vita al nostro Paese e ai nostri cittadini, per poter poi, eventualmente, accettare gli immigrati che entrano nel nostro Paese onestamente e regolarmente. Nessun ha mai voluto fare la guerra agli immigrati solo perché sono extracomunitari, ma in questo caso parliamo di immigrati clandestini: si tratta di un concetto ben diverso. <p> Esiste una criminalità che nasce proprio da questa situazione e dall'impossibilità di dar loro lavoro e futuro. Smettiamo di parlare di criminalità di serie A e di serie B. La criminalità è criminalità e basta e come tale va combattuta e vanno difesi i nostri cittadini. Ci vogliono accordi bilaterali per il rimpatrio. Queste persone devono scontare la pena nel loro Paese dove, a differenza dell'Italia, cari signori, la pena è certa e le carceri - passatemi la battuta - non sono certamente degli alberghi a cinque stelle. <p> E poi le Forze dell'ordine? Chi vi lavora? Quale rispetto invece per questi lavoratori? Quali garanzie per chi, ogni giorno, combatte la criminalità e mette a rischio, a repentaglio la propria vita, non dico senza incentivi economici, ma addirittura sotto pagati e sotto organico, nonché disincentivati da provvedimenti che come questo sicuramente ridurranno la loro voglia comunque di combattere e di mantenere il Paese ancora onesto e vivibile. Credo sia scorretto, anche nei confronti di chi ogni giorno combatte la criminalità, accettare questo disegno e, in particolare, l'annullamento del reato di clandestinità. Non possiamo demotivare il loro agire. <p> Infine, pensiamo ai tribunali che, con la riforma della geografia giudiziaria, vengono addirittura chiusi, anche quelli efficienti. Ma forse qualcuno dovrebbe capire che i tempi della giustizia sono inammissibili in questo Paese e che bisogna farli funzionare e non chiudere. Bisogna permettere a quelli efficienti di rimanere attivi e - ripeto - a quelli che non funzionano di lavorare, ottimizzando il loro operato. Occorre, risolvere queste problematiche e come si fa? Chiudendoli. <p> Questo è l'operato dell'attuale Governo: disfa un sistema e, invece di fare scelte incisive per una ripresa, continua ad agire in senso completamente contrario. Come qualcuno ha detto ieri, sembrate governare come si muovono i gamberi. <p> Signori, la giustizia ha tempi biblici e vergognosi, tempi che riempiono le carceri di detenuti ancora in attesa di giudizio. Questa è la verità. Stiamo andando indietro ogni giorno di più. Diciamo basta a questa demagogia populista, a questo mancato ed evidente rispetto dei vostri cittadini, di quelli onesti, signori miei. Possibile che la visione univoca vada solo nel senso del rispetto per i delinquenti che illegalmente entrano nel nostro Paese? Ma che messaggio diamo ai nostri figli, alla nostra gente? Che futuro diamo loro? E ci chiediamo perché se ne vanno da questo Paese: non solo perché manca il lavoro, signori, ma perché esso non dà loro più nulla, non dà certezza e sicurezza. <p> Non permette più di potervi restare. I nostri giovani se ne vanno perché molte sono le cause, e non solo perché manca il lavoro. Credetemi. <p> Dopo questo provvedimento folle il Paese avrà sicuramente ancora meno sicurezza, meno possibilità nel futuro, meno lavoro e meno voglia di rimanere. Manteniamo clandestini a scapito di immigrati onesti. Ricordiamoci che abbiamo anche una immigrazione onesta, che si è integrata nel nostro Paese e - credetemi - che è essa stessa contraria alla attuale situazione che arreca comunque problematiche alle loro famiglie. Ci sono immigrati nel Paese che hanno voglia di farsi un futuro, di crescere, di lavorare, di integrarsi e di rispettare le regole. Sono presenti anche queste persone, certo, e ad esse il nostro Paese non ha mai negato nulla, anzi gli ha permesso di costruirsi quel futuro che tanto desideravano e che speravano di trovare nel nostro territorio. <p> Noi difendiamo la nostra gente, quella che ora si deve chiudere in casa, che si deve difendere e che deve difendere le proprie fatiche - gli anziani e i figli - da chi non ha rispetto di niente e nessuno, da chi ha una cultura ben diversa dalla nostra. <p> Ripeto, questo è un Governo che funziona al contrario. <p> Smettiamo poi di parlare della storia del nostro Paese, una storia di emigrazione e di povertà. Vengo dal Veneto e in particolare dal bellunese, terra di emigranti, signori, che ritengo ogni giorno offendiate rapportandoli a questi immigrati. I nostri emigranti senza un contratto non partivano, diversamente la frontiera non veniva varcata. Venivano controllati e visitati - esisteva una situazione comunque di controllo sanitario negli altri Paesi - e a volte purtroppo anche umiliati. Non partivano e non arrivano con l'arroganza che oggi, purtroppo, gli immigrati hanno nel pretendere solo diritti e nessun dovere in questo Paese. <p> Smettiamola quindi di offendere i nostri emigranti che, all'estero, hanno portato il loro valore, la loro capacità, la concretezza di voler fare, di crescere e dare lustro al nostro Paese. Hanno portato comunque competenze e si sono distinti in vari campi. E lo hanno dimostrato in tutto il mondo, tra l'altro, i nostri italiani che - ripeto - hanno saputo portare non solo competenze, ma anche rimesse, capitali ed economia. <p> Ora voi, al contrario, aprite le porte illudendo questi disperati a suon di miliardi euro, magari gli ultimi, ma comunque miliardi di euro. Sappiamo infatti cosa costano questi viaggi, tra l'altro, verso un futuro praticamente inesistente, a chi si imbarca verso questo Paese, che io definirei, a questo punto, ipocrita: un Paese che non ha rispetto dei cittadini, specialmente dei più deboli. Ma chi li deve tutelare se non un Governo? Chi deve dare quella sicurezza agli anziani, che dopo una vita di lavoro hanno paura di essere scippati, magari della sola pensione che permette loro di sostentarsi, di vivere, quando va bene? O come capita sempre (episodi che sono accaduti recentemente anche nelle mie zone), vengono picchiati a sangue, e picchiati da chi? Nell'ultimo episodio, signori miei, i responsabili erano comunque extracomunitari, che queste persone avevano accolto e aiutato perché anche loro migranti in gioventù; persone che avevano dato a questi immigrati fiducia, tanta da aprirgli le porte e da essere riempiti di botte e derubati. <p> Questo succede anche, signori miei, perché il nostro Paese è comunque ‑ come si diceva prima ‑ aperto e disponibile. Ma purtroppo accadono anche queste cose. La fiducia che noi diamo a queste persone che vivono nell'indigenza non sempre viene ripagata, anzi, purtroppo - lo vediamo quotidianamente - le cose vanno nel verso sbagliato. Viviamo quindi nella paura. <p> Credo veramente che sia ora che questo Governo valuti come il provvedimento possa rappresentare, se approvato, un'ulteriore vergogna di questo Paese. <p> Pensiamo, poi, alle culture, alla diversità di cultura. Noi donne, anzi voi donne (a questo punto io e il mio Gruppo ci chiamiamo fuori, avendo una concretezza ben diversa) siete venute in questa sede a parlare, vi siete lavate la bocca, avete parlato del trattato di Istanbul, avete demagogicamente portato avanti problemi che riguardano le violenze sulle donne; ma avete idea di come siamo diversi culturalmente, dell'abisso che c'è nel modo di concepire la famiglia, la donna, le figlie nella nostra cultura rispetto a quelle alle quali vogliamo aprire le porte? Credo che gli episodi che si vedono ogni giorno lo possano dimostrare. <p> Vi sono casi in cui le figlie, nate in Italia, purché non entrino nella nostra cultura, in una cultura comunque libera, vengono uccise, signori miei, soppresse. Dovreste forse leggere qualche libro che riguarda situazioni che si sono verificate negli anni alle donne italiane che sono andate a vivere in questi Paesi; forse vi aprirebbero gli occhi, per capire la brutalità e la violenza che viene usata verso la donna stessa. Non possiamo fare buonismo e perdere, noi, la nostra dignità e la nostra forza, per lasciare spazio a queste violenze, che sono inaudite. <p> Serve una seria politica economica e sociale, rigida, con leggi che vedano la risposta in pene concrete e serie. Date sicurezza alla nostra gente, date loro una casa. Forse qualcuno prima l'ha già detto: vi è stata la manifestazione a Roma per il diritto alla casa. Ma guardiamo le graduatorie, signori miei, guardiamo chi prende le case popolari, chi ha alloggi dei Comuni, chi riceve sostentamenti. Non sono i nostri cittadini, che magari per una vita hanno lavorato e si trovano con una pensione minima, sicuramente non con una pensione d'oro (che tra l'altro qui qualcuno ha ancora sostenuto). <p> Non riescono nemmeno a pagarsi il vivere quotidiano e l'ultima settimana nemmeno vedono la carne sulla tavola. Però le case le diamo agli extracomunitari, quelli ovviamente che non hanno fino ad oggi prodotto alcun tipo di reddito o di sicurezza del Paese. <p> Ricordiamoci: prima la nostra gente, signori, che ha il diritto fondamentale di avere una risposta per quello che ha dato al proprio Paese, lavorando onestamente. <p> Siamo convinti, quindi, che non si possa assolutamente accettare questo disegno di legge, che non si possa assolutamente togliere il futuro ai nostri figli e alla nostra gente. Questo provvedimento oggi nega questo futuro. <p> È un provvedimento che porterà veramente un cambiamento, un'apertura, in cui l'Italia verrà vista come il Paese del «andiamoci tutti, tanto non accade nulla; facciamo quello che vogliamo, tanto nessuno ci dirà nulla; possiamo occupare anche il Paese, anzi, perché non farlo? Tanto, comunque, non avremo alcun tipo di pena, solo sconti e solo diritti». È questo ciò che accade, signori miei. <p> Riteniamo che sia veramente grave il voto di questo provvedimento e sia ancora più grave aver cancellato il reato di clandestinità. Signori, forse questa è la cosa più grave di questo disegno di legge che vi trovate a dover votare e, comunque, a dover giustificare anche ai vostri cittadini. <p> Oggi in questo Paese avrete legalizzato l'invasione di chi saprà di essere tutelato, a differenza dei nostri cittadini onesti. Questa è la verità, signori miei, e quando si parla del pacchetto sicurezza che Maroni aveva varato nel 2009, ebbene chi ha detto che il nostro ministro Castelli non ha assolutamente agito nella correttezza del risultato, credo che forse si dovrebbe rileggere i dati, verificarli e capirne la consistenza. <p> Comunque, preannunciando quella che sarà la dichiarazione di voto finale, che verrà svolta dalla mia collega, noi della Lega siamo completamente contrari a questo provvedimento e vogliamo ribadire che non saremo complici di questa vergogna.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5405969619750977, 0.45940300822257996]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> LA <PARTY>ETRA (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi senatori, membri del Governo, ho già avuto modo di esprimere il nostro pensiero in discussione generale quindi cercherò di non ripetere concetti già esposti. Il nostro è stato un atteggiamento soprattutto di stimolo nei confronti del provvedimento. Abbiamo cercato di dare un contributo positivo, pur nella consapevolezza della reale impossibilità di modificare il testo del decreto-legge uscito dalla discussione avvenuta alla Camera. Nonostante ciò, abbiamo presentato una serie di emendamenti puntuali, proprio con questo spirito. Penso agli emendamenti relativi all'articolo 2, che prevedono un contributo destinato alla copertura dei costi sostenuti per gli interessi sui mutui bancari contratti dalle imprese entro la data del 31 dicembre 2018. Abbiamo presentato delle proposte di modifica con la finalità di estendere tale contributo anche ad altre operazioni finanziarie oltre il 31 dicembre 2018 e fino all'entrata in vigore di questa legge e le coperture di questi costi non solo per il 2019 ma anche per il 2020. Penso agli emendamenti all'articolo 3, con cui abbiamo cercato di migliorare la tracciabilità del latte ovino e caprino attraverso l'identificazione di tutti i soggetti coinvolti nella produzione. Penso alla nostra proposta per un rifinanziamento del fondo di intervento per il settore olivicolo-oleario, con un incremento sostanziale da 5 a 10 milioni di euro, proprio per l'importanza del settore specifico. Penso alla questione della xylella, per cui abbiamo presentato degli emendamenti in cui si prevede una procedura di automatico assenso all'eradicazione delle piante contaminate della zona infetta oppure all'emendamento con cui chiediamo di istituire la figura di un commissario straordinario incaricato di attuare tutte le misure necessarie ad arginare la diffusione del batterio, senza contare la nostra richiesta di risorse ulteriori per il rilancio delle strutture di trasformazione; mi riferisco ai frantoi che, a causa della diminuzione del prodotto, rischiano di chiudere. Abbiamo fatto tutto ciò senza scordarci della reale responsabilità della Regione Puglia, che ha trasformato una situazione di normale gestione in una vera e propria emergenza nazionale. Abbiamo anche chiesto, tramite alcuni emendamenti, di estendere gli aiuti per gli eventi atmosferici del 2018 anche alle altre Regioni che, come la Puglia, hanno subito notevoli danni. Penso agli emendamenti volti a dare aiuti anche a seguito di altre emergenze, come quelle degli allevamenti avicoli e dei settori saccarifero e del mais, e, non ultimo, a un incremento del fondo per l'Istituto zooprofilattico sperimentale del Mezzogiorno, che sta realizzando tutta la propria attività solo con fondi propri. Vi è insomma una serie di proposte concrete per migliorare questa legge, ma non solo: in Commissione abbiamo espresso voto contrario su pochissimi emendamenti; su alcuni ci siamo astenuti, ma sulla stragrande maggioranza abbiamo votato a favore, indipendentemente dalla parte politica che li aveva presentati, ritenendoli tutti di buonsenso e a favore dell'agricoltura, anche se poi sono stati respinti nella loro interezza dalla maggioranza di Governo. Peccato, perché si è persa un'ulteriore possibilità di contribuire, tutti insieme, a uno dei settori più importanti della nostra produzione. Segnalo infine che, nonostante la bocciatura dell'intero pacchetto degli emendamenti proposti da <PARTY>, attraverso il lavoro in Commissione il nostro Gruppo è riuscito quantomeno a ottenere alcuni impegni, grazie alla trasformazione di quattro dei nostri emendamenti in altrettanti ordini del giorno, tutti accolti dal Governo, anche in Aula. Si tratta di misure di buonsenso, che vanno dal supporto alle aziende a rischio chiusura in ragione del calo delle moliture e dal riconoscimento di contributi a sostegno dei frantoi e delle cooperative di trasformazione al fine di sostenere la capacità produttiva dell'olio d'oliva, all'estensione delle misure per la competitività delle imprese agricole nel comparto cerealicolo anche alla coltura del mais e, infine, alla facilitazione della prevenzione e del controllo delle infezioni negli allevamenti avicoli. Auspichiamo che questi impegni siano effettivamente onorati dal Governo, perseguendo con efficacia la finalità di rilancio di un settore in profonda sofferenza, che è propria di questo provvedimento. Per questi motivi, annuncio il voto di astensione del Gruppo <PARTY> e le chiedo di consentirmi di concludere, signor Presidente, con un appello al Governo, al Ministro e, nello specifico, al Sottosegretario in particolare. Il provvedimento al nostro esame cerca di dare soluzioni ad alcune emergenze, forse le maggiori, ma sicuramente non tutte: sarebbe stato preferibile allargare l'orizzonte d'intervento. Vanno bene gli aiuti e tutto quello che stiamo facendo, perché comunque il comparto agricolo ne ha bisogno; in tutto ciò, però, manca un intervento vero e concreto sulla più grande emergenza che soffoca la nostra agricoltura, ossia la burocrazia, signor Sottosegretario. I nostri coltivatori, allevatori e pescatori e tutta la filiera di trasformazione soffrono continuamente - quasi fosse un'emergenza, al pari degli eventi atmosferici - per una burocrazia asfissiante, che vede le nostre aziende, soprattutto quelle piccole e medie, combattere quotidianamente con un sistema che impedisce loro di produrre e lavorare con tranquillità. Nessuno, sia ben chiaro, vuole sottrarsi al rispetto delle regole, purché siano semplici e comprensibili. Signor Sottosegretario, intervenga con il Governo su quella che è la vera e più grande emergenza del mondo agricolo.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5207831263542175, 0.47921687364578247]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> D'ANNA (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ebbi modo di dire in questa Aula qualche giorno fa (ma non era presente in quella occasione il Ministro), che anche la peritonite lascia 48 ore di tempo. E dovendosi mettere mano a una parte fondamentale della nostra Costituzione, qual è la sua parte seconda, tutta questa velocità, tutto questo arrabattarsi per stare all'interno di date che sono vicinissime, presuppongono ben altri scopi che non la disponibilità a fare questa modifica nelle Aule del Parlamento. Ebbi poi modo di dire che, già dal punto di vista procedurale, dovendosi lavorare su di un atto che non era di iniziativa parlamentare, ma dell'Esecutivo, la cosa poco quadrava. Si è fatto un gran parlare del fatto che le regole del gioco le si modifica e si concorre a modificarle tutti insieme, ma sembra veramente un paradosso che sia il Governo (il potere costituito in quel momento) a proporre questo cambio di regole. Anche io ritengo che una qualche forma ostruzionistica, se del caso, la faremo, così come l'abbiamo subita quando il centrodestra era maggioranza in queste Aule. La faremo, sì, ma dal punto di vista della contestazione di quello, che a nostro avviso, non va. E mi sembra veramente oltremodo strano, anche dalle affermazioni un po' apodittiche che il Ministro ha svolto stamattina in quest'Aula, che non sia considerato nostro buon diritto farci sentire sui punti sui quali noi non siamo d'accordo. Mi sembra che buona parte della contestazione e dei malumori sia incentrata sul fatto che a noi non piace un Senato che non sia elettivo e al suo combinato disposto con l'Italicum (che è pronto come legge elettorale). Sostanzialmente, al di là dei panegirici e dei giri di parole, noi ci troveremo di fronte, quando, malauguratamente questo dovesse diventare legge dello Stato, al fatto che abbiamo praticamente conculcato la libertà e il diritto che il popolo italiano hanno di scegliersi i parlamentari. Di questo si tratta, e non di altro. Quindi, non riusciamo a capire perché un Governo animato, a dire del Primo Ministro e del ministro Boschi, da ogni buon sentimento nei confronti della collaborazione che nelle Aule parlamentari deve venire su queste tematiche, si intestardisca e faccia di questo tema una linea di confine: quasi che far scegliere al popolo i propri rappresentanti sia da considerare come le colonne d'Ercole tra quello che è il vecchio e quello che è il nuovo. Io, da buon liberale, sono conservatore e progressista. Tendo a conservare la libertà quando questa viene minacciata, e sono progressista quando altri spazi di libertà devono essere ancora conquistati. Quello che non mi è piaciuto e ha dato forse luogo a questo mio intervento è stato il giudizio tranchant che il Ministro ha dato sul fatto che chiunque volesse modificare quest'impianto appartenesse alla categoria dei retrogradi, ai nostalgici di un'Italia che in 30 anni non ha voluto cambiare le cose. Guardi, signor Ministro, che le cose si possono anche cambiare in peggio. <p> Il cambiamento in quanto tale è quindi un aggettivazione, ma non sempre positiva, perché cambiare non significa necessariamente cambiare in meglio o cambiare quello che serve al cambiamento stesso. <p> Così come ho trovato del tutto fuori luogo - ma fa parte forse della dialettica governativa - definire folli coloro i quali non ci stanno! Ebbene, se devo richiamare Tommaso Moro e quello che disse Erasmo da Rotterdam nel «Morias Enkomion», evviva Dio che esiste l'«Elogio della follia»! Infatti, da «Il berretto a sonagli» di Pirandello a «Uomo e galantuomo» di Eduardo sono costantemente chiamati folli tutti coloro che hanno un atteggiamento di schiettezza, tutti coloro che non riescono a percorrere quello che Thomas Mann chiamava «la via maestra», in fondo alla quale ci sono sempre il conformismo, l'opportunismo e la mediocrità. <p> Quindi, che il Governo ci dia la patente di folli - per la verità, personalmente me la sono beccata anche in altre sedi - viva Dio, signora Ministro, per dirla con Eduardo, che in una famosa poesia dialettale conclude dicendo «e pure s'incontr 'a morte a guarde 'n faccia nun tengo paura 'o stesso, pecché a mmè me fa paura sul' 'o fesso!».

Su questo provvedimento, purtroppo, il Governo chiede la fiducia. <p> Leggo testualmente le dichiarazioni del presidente Conte che ancora stamani affermava: «No a steccati, la politica deve dare l\\'esempio», e che «tra il Governo e le opposizioni c\\'è un confronto costante». A questo punto, non so cosa dire se non, con pacatezza ma anche veramente molta amarezza, che in realtà sarebbe stato molto più rispettoso per il Paese e soprattutto per tutte le categorie che sono in prima linea, che lottano contro il virus e che stanno portando avanti il Paese, se questo provvedimento fosse stato approvato - non a chiacchiere o a parole - con il voto unanime di tutti. Sarebbe stato bello vedere domani il Senato approvare all\\'unanimità il provvedimento cura Italia, questo sì sarebbe stato simbolicamente un bell\\'esempio di unità nazionale. <p> Caro Sottosegretario, ho molto apprezzato il lavoro che lei ha fatto in tutti questi giorni. Proprio su questo abbiamo lavorato per giorni e giorni per poter votare insieme questo provvedimento, ma in realtà non ci viene consentito, nonostante tutto quello che è accaduto in questi giorni. Il collega Quagliariello prima ha chiesto se il Governo vuole fare da solo. Il Governo continua a fare da solo; unità e responsabilità sono solo apparenza. Forza Italia e l\\'intero centrodestra, senza alcuno spirito ostruzionistico - lo abbiamo dimostrato - hanno cercato di proporre una serie di soluzioni, dalla scuola all\\'agricoltura, dalle famiglie ai lavoratori e alle imprese. Ci sono state ore e ore di videoconferenze. Di fronte a tutto questo il Governo non ha preso alcun impegno. Ci è stato detto che le risorse per questo decreto-legge sono state spese, andremo a ragionare sul prossimo ma non si sa quando e quali risorse ci saranno. Tutte perdite di tempo? A cosa serve allora essere qui oggi a discutere e intervenire? Come testimonianza - ormai resta solo tale - di questa famosa unità nazionale? Noi abbiamo fatto una serie di proposte. Come lei sa, signor Sottosegretario, abbiamo ritirato moltissimi emendamenti, ma quelli su cui abbiamo tentato di continuare a lavorare con voi sono stati tutti bocciati. Sono state ricordate da tanti la questione dei fitti degli studenti fuori sede e la nostra proposta di utilizzare i percettori di reddito di cittadinanza per l\\'emergenza. Non è una cosa scandalosa; tutti devono dare il proprio contributo. Ricordo anche la proposta di aumentare lo stipendio dei medici, degli infermieri e di tutto il personale sanitario e, soprattutto, il nostro emendamento sulla reintroduzione temporanea dei voucher per un periodo di emergenza, che avrebbe dato una boccata d\\'ossigeno a tutti: all\\'agricoltura, all\\'artigianato, ai servizi alla persona e ai commercianti. È stata una chiusura totale che ritengo ingiustificata. Mi chiedo a cosa siano servite tutte queste ore e ore di riunioni con le opposizioni. Il decreto di aprile nessuno l\\'ha visto. Addirittura, ci avete detto che non potevate accogliere alcune delle nostre proposte perché eravate ideologicamente contrari. Ma cosa significa «ideologicamente»? Voi avete il dovere, insieme a noi, di fare il bene del Paese, non le guerre ideologiche. Altro che coesione nazionale! Ora basta, però. Basta con questa propaganda di regime. Basta con questa comunicazione ampollosa del Presidente del Consiglio, che invade e pervade l\\'informazione con i suoi \"sermoni\". L\\'altro giorno il presidente Conte ha fatto credere agli italiani che dava soldi ai Comuni, e non era così, perché era solo un anticipo. Ha mentito agli imprenditori, perché ha detto loro che dava 400 miliardi di euro, mentre è solo un prestito, tra l\\'altro con gli interessi. <p> Questo è incitamento all\\'illusione. <p> Signor Presidente, i cittadini e le imprese non meritano tutto questo. I cittadini e le imprese hanno bisogno ora di soldi e di certezze, di indennizzi immediati a fondo perduto e di sostegni economici per tirare avanti. Come si fa a partire con la fase 2, se la fase 1 non è ancora finita e se, quando inizierà la fase 2, magari il Paese sarà finito? Io ricordo a questo Governo che, quanto più chiede la fiducia, tanto più non la merita un Governo la fiducia. Concludo citando il cardinale Suenens: «Chi accende una luce al buio si aspetti le zanzare». Noi abbiamo provato a dare un contributo. Abbiamo provato a migliorare il provvedimento insieme a voi. Abbiamo acceso la luce sul buio di molte parti di questo provvedimento ma abbiamo ricevuto solo zanzare. <p> Signor Presidente, Governo, in bocca al lupo a tutti gli italiani!', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5590349435806274, 0.44096508622169495]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, ci troviamo a discutere un disegno di legge che è già stato approvato in prima lettura dalla Camera e che mira a contrastare gravi fenomeni di danno e sfruttamento dell'ambiente. <p> Richiamando brevemente i punti qualificanti del provvedimento, si introducono nuove fattispecie di reato nel codice penale per punire l'inquinamento ed il disastro ambientale, il traffico di materiali radioattivi ed i comportamenti elusivi dei controlli; si prevede inoltre che per tali reati siano raddoppiati i termini ordinari di prescrizione; il testo prevede anche l'ipotesi colposa e l'aumento delle pene nel caso in cui tali reati siano commessi nell'ambito di associazioni a delinquere o di tipo mafioso. L'apparato sanzionatorio immaginato si completa, da una parte, con la confisca dei beni che sono il prodotto o il profitto del reato o che sono stati ad esso strumentali, e, dall'altra, con l'obbligo per il condannato al recupero e, se possibile, al ripristino a proprie spese dello stato dei luoghi. Si prevede, infine, un meccanismo premiale di riduzione delle pene per chi collabora con le autorità prima della definizione del giudizio, anche per evitare ulteriori conseguenze dannose, e per chi mette in sicurezza, bonifica o ripristina lo stato dei luoghi. <p> Il provvedimento individua soluzioni ad una grave emergenza che colpisce da anni il nostro Paese ed in particolare le Regioni meridionali, a cui non si è riusciti a dare una risposta forte e concreta. Il problema dell'abuso dei nostri territori è sotto gli occhi di tutti, ma ci sembra che questo disegno di legge sia malcongegnato e, piuttosto che rappresentare un primo passo per risolvere la questione ambientale, sia invece inevitabilmente destinato ad aumentare la confusione e l'incertezza in materia. Siamo convinti che siano necessarie definizioni più puntuali e specifiche dei nuovi reati, che abbiamo proposto con i nostri emendamenti. Di questo avviso è stato anche il parere della 1ᵃ Commissione, affari costituzionali, che ha esposto la necessità di rispettare compiutamente il principio di determinatezza della fattispecie penale. Solo a fronte di una nozione di reato precisa e ben definita si possono colpire effettivamente i colpevoli e non lasciare una zona di incertezza nell'interpretazione della norma che può ostacolare o colpire ingiustamente le attività di imprenditori onesti che vogliono portare avanti il proprio lavoro in maniera corretta. <p> La soluzione di sicuro non può essere rappresentata da nuovi reati collegati a pene così elevate da arrivare fino a vent'anni di reclusione. Le nostre proposte di riportare le pene ad un livello accettabile ed effettivamente applicabile si ricollegano ad una precisa considerazione: un sistema così fortemente sanzionatorio è reso ancora più inefficace e dannoso se consideriamo che i termini di prescrizione vengono raddoppiati. Il risultato è che un cittadino può essere sottoposto ad un reato per così dire permanente, in cui la certezza e la stabilità dell'ordinamento viene negata, così come viene negato il diritto alla difesa e ad un giusto processo. <p> D'altra parte, l'introduzione di meccanismi premiali, che hanno un fondamento condivisibile perché responsabilizzano il soggetto coinvolto nella riduzione delle conseguenze dannose dei suoi comportamenti, viene resa inefficace. Per esempio, quale interesse ci può essere alla bonifica e alla messa in sicurezza del territorio se poi questo sarà oggetto di confisca da parte dell'autorità pubblica? L'incentivo al ravvedimento operoso deve essere necessariamente maggiore, prevedendo, come ha proposto il nostro Gruppo, di escludere la confisca nell'ipotesi in cui l'imputato abbia efficacemente posto in essere le condotte di ravvedimento operoso. Parallelamente, servono termini più larghi rispetto a quelli previsti da questo provvedimento per dare la possibilità di portare a compimento le azioni di riparazione. <p> Vorrei sottolineare poi la solita incoerenza del Governo che, completamente distante dalla realtà delle cose, con il decreto milleproroghe taglia quasi 10 milioni di euro per la sorveglianza della terra dei fuochi. Questo è uno degli aspetti più dolenti del problema ambientale nel Mezzogiorno, dove una zona compresa tra Napoli e Caserta è tormentata da troppi anni da pratiche illegali che hanno portato all'interramento di rifiuti tossici e dove si registra un'altissima percentuale di mortalità per tumori e leucemie. Il Governo ha pensato bene di togliere le già carenti risorse per limitare il problema e destinarle invece all'EXPO di Milano, per garantire la sicurezza antiterrorismo dell'evento. <p> Per concludere, siamo di fronte ad un disegno di legge che ancora una volta è fatto di disposizioni inutilmente punitive, controproducente rispetto agli importanti obiettivi che si è prefissato e che aumenterà la confusione giuridica e l'incertezza per i cittadini. Il risultato sarà quello di avere norme inapplicabili e che non rappresentano neppure un primo passo in avanti per risolvere uno stato di emergenza ambientale diffuso e che ha un impatto diretto ed estremamente dannoso sulla vita di tutti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6584977507591248, 0.34150227904319763]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> PAGLIARI (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, signor Ministro, onorevoli colleghi, il Gruppo <PARTY> voterà a favore della proposta di risoluzione n. 3. Tuttavia, non possiamo dimenticare che ci troviamo oggi a valutare un documento in una condizione un po\\' anomala. È stato, infatti, predisposto da un Governo che non è più in carica e che aveva nei suoi riferimenti programmatici proposte diverse da quelle dell\\'attuale Governo. Il DEF al nostro esame manca ancora, peraltro, del Programma nazionale di riforma previsto dalla legge di contabilità. Il Governo Monti infatti non lo aveva presentato; al suo posto vi è soltanto un\\'analisi sull\\'attuazione delle riforme approvate, che peraltro hanno visto il Mezzogiorno in una posizione di costante subalternità e di penalizzazione. Gran parte dell\\'impianto del DEF appare, quindi, superato. Il Governo Letta dovrà predisporre il Programma nazionale di riforma e inviarlo alle Camere insieme alla Nota di aggiornamento al DEF, da presentarsi al più presto, tenendo conto delle indicazioni programmatiche del 29 aprile, sulle quali il Governo ha chiesto e ottenuto, la fiducia. Questo dibattito diventa allora fondamentalmente un\\'opportunità per questo Governo: un\\'opportunità di ascoltare il pensiero del Parlamento rispetto alla predisposizione della Nota di aggiornamento. A quel punto ci sarà il vero dibattito sulle scelte di politica economica. Vorrei ricordare che le dichiarazioni programmatiche del Governo Letta propongono modifiche non marginali relativamente alle politiche fiscali. Parliamo di sospensione e di soppressione dell\\'IMU (che è quello che chiediamo) e della rinunzia all\\'applicazione dell\\'aumento dell\\'aliquota IVA: scelte rispetto alle quali occorrerà prevedere nuove e diverse entrate o tagli alla spesa a copertura del minore gettito; condizioni che evidentemente non potevano essere considerate nel DEF. Ma prima di tutto vi è la necessità di determinare un vero e proprio cambiamento di rotta a partire dalla valorizzazione delle risorse che fino ad oggi sono rimaste sottoutilizzate. E la prima grande risorsa sottoutilizzata, a nostro giudizio, è rappresentata dal nostro Mezzogiorno. Se il Sud riprende a crescere, riparte l\\'Italia intera; l\\'Italia cresce se cresce il Sud, afferma la SVIMEZ: \"Il sistema Italia deve fare grande affidamento sulla possibilità di riattivare lo sviluppo del Sud, definendo le condizioni che, con immediata efficacia anticongiunturale, abbiano il respiro di un\\'azione mirata ad obiettivi strategici di valenza nazionale\". Abbiamo una serie di emergenze: la prima è quella del lavoro, in particolare quello dei giovani e delle donne. Occorre più lavoro, più lavoro per tutti; occorre il lavoro al Sud. In Germania metà della popolazione è stabilmente occupata. La stabilità del posto di lavoro si riduce al 38 per cento nel nostro Paese e addirittura il lavoro stabile nel Mezzogiorno è al di sotto del 28 per cento. I dati della disoccupazione sono drammatici: siamo all\\'11,6 per cento, il doppio rispetto ai dati del 2007, e si valuta che i livelli di disoccupazione al Sud investano per il 39 per cento i giovani e per il 50 per cento le giovani donne. Si tratta di dati drammatici che determinano una spirale perversa che inibisce ogni possibilità di sviluppo. E le stime nel breve periodo non sono incoraggianti, senza considerare le previsioni degli organismi internazionali che ci forniscono dati ancora più preoccupanti. Occorre rilanciare il welfare non limitandosi alla previdenza e agli ammortizzatori sociali e individuando in questo rilancio non solo un\\'occasione di miglioramento della qualità della cittadinanza, bensì una concreta opportunità di costruzione di una nuova stagione di coesione, che è quella di cui ha bisogno il nostro Paese. La difesa dei più deboli e un sistema credibile di tutela contro le povertà possono diventare essi stessi un volano per riavviare una spirale positiva per lo sviluppo. A questo proposito, vorrei segnalare che a causa delle note difficoltà economiche si riduce la spesa e che le famiglie italiane hanno ridotto la spesa anche in due settori essenziali quali il cibo, con una riduzione del 3 per cento e addirittura la salute, con una riduzione del 2,5 per cento. Sono dati preoccupanti, non solo perché la povertà rischia di risucchiare migliaia di famiglie, ma anche complessivamente, per tutta l\\'economia, che ne risente in modo gravissimo. Bisogna puntare sulla valorizzazione del territorio, dell\\'ambiente e del patrimonio culturale, specialmente delle aree del Mezzogiorno. In una scelta così importante, è peraltro possibile individuare straordinarie occasioni di sviluppo e nuove occupazioni. Ma non si potrà avere un autentico rilancio dello sviluppo se si dimentica di promuovere il rafforzamento e il completamento delle reti infrastrutturali e logistiche, carenti, soprattutto al Sud, ripensando, ad esempio le scelte sul Ponte del precedente Governo e puntando sul miglioramento e, sul completamento della rete ferroviaria in Sicilia e nelle Regioni del Mezzogiorno. Non si avrà rilancio se non si avrà la capacità di favorire l\\'integrazione del sistema produttivo meridionale nel mercato internazionale con adeguate misure di sostegno. Non si avrà rilancio se non si punta alle fonti energetiche, specialmente quelle rinnovabili, particolarmente importanti per il Sud ed anche per l\\'intero Paese, per contribuire a realizzare l\\'obiettivo, fondamentale per l\\'economia nazionale, di ridurre il tasso di dipendenza dall\\'energia dall\\'estero. Attendiamo la Nota aggiuntiva al DEF, sulla quale sappiamo che il ministro Saccomanni sta lavorando, ma vogliamo sottolineare alcune priorità: anticipare al 1° luglio 2013 le deduzioni dell\\'IRAP che la legge di stabilità prevede a partire soltanto dal 2014 (lo ricordo: 7.500 euro di detrazioni per lavoratori dipendenti a tempo indeterminato, 13.500 euro per le donne e gli under 35, che diventano 15.000 e 21.000 euro nelle aree del Mezzogiorno); aumentare le deduzioni per le piccole imprese, quelle che hanno meno di 10 dipendenti, specie nel Mezzogiorno; rivedere il Patto di stabilità, somministrando l\\'ossigeno che serve a Comuni e imprese; rilanciare il federalismo fiscale, consentendo ai Comuni di disporre delle risorse che derivano dalla fiscalità di loro competenza. Un attimo fa abbiamo scambiato con il senatore Calderoli questa considerazione: voliamo alto - ed è giusto - ma stiamo attenti, perché rischiamo di planare e trovare la gran parte dei nostri Comuni \"saltati\". Chiediamo ancora di aumentare del 50 per cento le detrazioni per i figli a carico: si tratterebbe di un interveto fondamentale per le famiglie a basso e medio reddito e in particolare per quelle delle aree meridionali. Dobbiamo anche ripensare alla possibilità di creare ampie zone di tassazione di vantaggio e queste iniziative dobbiamo farle valere in Europa: potrebbero essere un modello da suggerire agli amici dell\\'Europa per tutte le aree svantaggiate. Proprio la carenza di una strategia globale e di un serio coordinamento ha prodotto il fallimento delle politiche fin qui poste in essere. L\\'obiettivo dunque è realizzare un processo interattivo tra le Regioni del Sud e il Governo centrale, un processo che assicuri di nuovo l\\'unitarietà e una unica visione strategica per lo sviluppo del Paese.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5027583837509155, 0.4972416162490845]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, francamente la discussione che in queste ore stiamo svolgendo in quest'Aula in altri momenti mi avrebbe sicuramente interessato. Considerata la situazione della nostra Italia, alla luce anche dello show fatto ieri dal Presidente del Consiglio, probabilmente agli italiani, che anche ieri sono stati evocati e ai quali sarebbe stato chiesto se hanno interesse per la parità di genere (è stato ricordato da una collega che il 67 per cento ha risposto che ha interesse per questo discorso), bisognerebbe anche domandare se preferiscono che chi è in Senato (finché ci sarà, perché pare che Renzi abbia una questione personale con il Senato e i senatori, ma questo lo vedremo a parte) si concentri su questa faccenda o tenti di capire, per esempio, in tema di riduzione del costo del lavoro, dove andiamo a trovare le risorse, che a tutt'oggi sembrano essere fumose. Potremmo magari approfondire il tema della discrepanza fra i 7 miliardi di euro annunciati dal vostro Presidente del Consiglio e i 3 miliardi di euro tuttora evocati dall'addetto alla spending review. Vorrei capire, in tema di pagamenti da parte delle pubbliche amministrazioni alle imprese, come mai l'ex Ministro dell'economia e delle finanze continua a parlare di una certa cifra mentre l'attuale Governo parla di cifre diverse. Delle due l'una: se tutti questi soldi sono all'improvviso comparsi, vuol dire che i Governi Monti e Letta, che sempre da voi sono stati appoggiati, fino a ieri hanno raccontato, non tanto a noi quanto agli italiani, una serie di frottole. Probabilmente sarebbe più utile intrattenerci sul tema delle riforme vere, riforme che nel 2006 provammo a varare, ma contro le quali fu messo in campo un referendum dagli stessi che oggi parlano di queste riforme. Sarebbe utile capire e comprendere che il funzionamento e lo snellimento della macchina-Stato è importante e dirimente per tirare fuori la nostra Italia dalle secche della crisi. Sempre con riferimento alle riforme, occorrerebbe capire che un Senato - anche su questo oggi siamo sul piano delle fumosità - che oggi, nella migliore delle ipotesi, va a fare il doppione della Conferenza Stato‑Regioni non serve all'Italia e agli italiani. Come occorrerebbe capire, sempre trattando di riforme, che, quando si parla di abolizione delle Province, in realtà il tentativo è di riproporle in termini assolutamente diversi, con costi superiori, checché ne dica il vostro Presidente del Consiglio, e come del resto ha sottolineato anche la Corte dei conti. Forse questi sono i temi sui quali sarebbe il caso di intrattenerci, come pure sul fatto che, si dice, queste coperture verranno ricavate anche da una tassazione diversa delle rendite finanziarie: quando si andrà in Europa a dire che i BOT sono fuori, non so se l'Europa acconsentirà a questo tipo di operazione. È lecito pensare che, quando si annuncia questo, forse si mette in moto un meccanismo destinato a risolversi in una fuga di capitali, che alla fine ci porterà alla tassazione dei soliti noti, con in più magari una patrimoniale. E su questo tema bisogna capire, per esempio, se anche i risparmi non realizzati in BOT dalle tante famigliole - mi riferisco ai risparmi a lungo termine - saranno colpiti da questa tassazione superiore e diversa. Inoltre sarebbe il caso di intrattenerci su un altro tema: quando si chiede un contributo straordinario alle pensioni d'oro, siccome rientrano nelle pensioni d'oro coloro i quali prenderanno 2.500 euro, pagati peraltro con i contributi nel corso della loro vita lavorativa, mi domando se questo pensionato è veramente catalogabile fra i pensionati d'oro, atteso che prende 1.000 euro in più di quelli che dovrebbero essere beneficiati e che stanno al di sotto dei 1.500 euro. Forse sarebbe il caso, andando in un altro ambito, che ci si chiedesse, visto che ricorre giustamente il tema della democrazia, anche parlando di questa proposta di legge, come sia possibile in una democrazia che a poche centinaia di metri da qua - mi riferisco alle stanze della Camera - da anni sia in pista una sorta di Grande fratello che è andato schedando e registrando le telefonate di tutti i parlamentari. Cosa vuol dire questa cosa? Chi l'ha ordinata? Però, tant'è: siamo qui a parlare di questo provvedimento. Un provvedimento sul quale peraltro il Governo in carica non si è mai presentato in Commissione, se non nel pomeriggio di ieri, e sostanzialmente - come ci ha relazionato la relatrice - più di tanto non ha fornito illuminazioni sotto il profilo tecnico. Premesso che il derby maschietti-femminucce non ci interessa, segnalo nuovamente un aspetto che è emerso: la nostra Nazione, senza un grande bisogno di leggi particolari, ha una media di elette che si attesta sul 31 per cento. Segnalo che i Paesi europei dove sono stati introdotti dei paletti di questo tipo, guarda caso, in realtà, hanno messo in essere un'azione che si è risolta poi negativamente in termini di elezione di colleghe donne. In tutta Europa vediamo che, dove c'è una presenza maggiore di elette, questo avviene non tanto in forza di leggi, di paletti, di riserve, di quote (chiamatele come volete), ma di un processo culturale che, vivaddio, da quelle parti esiste, e probabilmente il compito di leggi come questa dovrebbe essere quello di agevolare questo tipo di processi, non già di imporli. Non c'è problema, ovviamente su spazi - anche qui divertitevi a chiamarli come volete - acciocché la presenza femminile sia ribadita nelle liste: quella che trovo francamente non potabile è l'imposizione, l'obbligatorietà delle preferenze. A me hanno insegnato che la politica è confronto e ricerca del consenso, e su questo canale ovviamente mi inserisco. Preferenze delle quali peraltro, quando si parla di altre leggi, tutti hanno il sacro terrore, e ci si rifugia sempre in queste liste di fatto bloccate, e, al riguardo, il discorso potrebbe essere lungo: non capisco perché la lista bloccata di trenta nomi è incostituzionale e invece quella di sei è diventata costituzionale. Evidentemente in questo Paese facciamo le costituzionalità a peso. Termino segnalando anche che evidentemente in Europa questo tema non è sentitissimo, atteso che è stato affrontato in altri termini e modi. Non è stato evidentemente sentito in maniera particolare se, non più tardi dell'altro ieri, una proposta di risoluzione che sottoponeva questo tema è stata respinta al mittente. Quindi, probabilmente la via dovrebbe essere quella di un sano equilibrio, per evitare, appunto, semplicemente una cosa: un danno alle donne e alle colleghe che desiderano cimentarsi in questa battaglia elettorale.

Tale percorso passa attraverso fasi di negoziato gestite dal Governo, in cui la principale preoccupazione di chi se ne deve occupare dovrebbe essere quella di tener conto dell'interesse nazionale delle nostre imprese, dei nostri cittadini e del nostro tessuto sociale ed economico. Le decisioni europee, infatti, in tutte le loro discutibili forme, incidono sulla vita politica, sociale ed economica del nostro Paese, per non parlare della loro capacità di incidere sulla salute e sull'alimentazione. <p> Il relatore correttamente diceva che il testo consta di 21 articoli e che c'è stata una discussione molto vivace in Commissione, ma la maggior parte dei nostri emendamenti erano e sono di buon senso, come è già capitato alla Camera, e sicuramente migliorativi del testo; pertanto, se davvero a questo Governo stavano a cuore le sorti dei nostri cittadini e delle nostre imprese, mi chiedo perché non si siano aperte discussioni veramente serie nelle Commissioni di merito e non si sia analizzata a fondo la finalità di tali emendamenti. <p> Gli argomenti contenuti nel provvedimento sono chiaramente eterogenei, sia per materia, che per competenza. Ricordiamone alcuni: si parla di etichettatura degli oli d'oliva, del miele, dell'aumento dell'IVA sui preparati per risotto per coprire una differente tassazione sul gioco d'azzardo; si parla dei veicoli degli studenti europei in Italia, delle aliquote IVA, del basilico, del rosmarino e della salvia freschi, dei tartufi e dell'indennizzo in favore delle vittime di reati internazionali violenti, di disposizioni relative alla natura della fauna selvatica; inoltre, il provvedimento reca raccomandazioni dell'Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza delle ferrovie e molto altro. Si tratta di argomenti sicuramente eterogenei, signora Presidente, di cui ricordiamo gli articoli 1, 2, 21, 22 e 23, che non sanano sanzioni ma intervengono sui casi EU Pilot che vanno a limitare i valori della trasparenza e correttezza delle informazioni. Questi articoli denotano infatti l'atteggiamento rinunciatario che questo Governo continua a tenere proprio nel settore agroalimentare, che dovrebbe invece costituire il vanto internazionale del nostro made in Italy. Signora Presidente, se poi vogliamo entrare nel merito, devo dire che io conosco bene il sottosegretario Gozi, in quanto abbiamo trascorso un'intera legislatura nella XIV Commissione della Camera; eravamo entrambi Presidenti: io nella fase ascendente e lui nella fase discendente della formazione delle norme europee. In quelle vesti molte volte ci siamo confrontati e a volte anche in modo piccato, ma sempre nella correttezza di chi cerca di portare del buono al proprio Paese. C'è però da dire che l'Europa come noi la intendiamo non è proprio questa. Noi vogliamo un'Europa che sia attenta ai cittadini, alle specificità dei propri territori, alla capacità di ogni Nazione di mettere in condizione i cittadini di trarre il meglio dalle capacità che hanno sia sotto l'aspetto produttivo, che imprenditoriale. Una delle normative più balorde che abbiamo considerato in questo periodo è la direttiva Bolkestein, che non molti giorni fa ha determinato problematiche legate a chi sta gestendo i nostri litorali. Mi rivolgo anche al Presidente del Consiglio che parlava di miglioramenti qua e là: forse è il caso di avere più forza e attenzione quando si è invitati a tre a un tavolo molto importante come quello successivo alla Brexit e al voto britannico: forse è il caso di capire che quell'invito è dovuto solamente al fatto che probabilmente, se un referendum di quel tipo fosse stato indetto in questo Paese, si sarebbe avuto lo stesso risultato.

L'Accordo, che segue il modello della Convenzione del Consiglio d'Europa del 1957, si compone di 11 articoli. <p> L'articolo 2, in particolare, introduce norme sulla non applicabilità della pena di morte. Gli articoli 3 e 4 prevedono alcune ipotesi in cui si può opporre un rifiuto all'estradizione (reati politici, timori fondati che nei confronti della persona vi siano rischi di discriminazione, casi di amnistia o grazia, eccetera). Sono poi abrogate le norme della Convenzione che limitavano l'estradizione in materia di tasse e imposte di dogana e di cambio. L'Accordo non comporta oneri finanziari per il nostro Paese. <p> Il secondo Accordo è volto a consentire il trasferimento nel proprio Stato di cittadinanza di cittadini detenuti nel territorio dell'altro Stato, al fine di facilitarne la rieducazione e il reinserimento. Lo strumento è necessario perché il Marocco non ha aderito alla Convenzione del Consiglio d'Europa del 1983 e al successivo Protocollo addizionale del 1987. <p> La Convenzione in esame, costituita da 22 articoli, prevede che il trasferimento dei detenuti non si applichi a soggetti con doppia cittadinanza e si applichi inoltre solo se la sentenza è esecutiva, se il periodo da espiare è superiore all'anno e se il reato commesso è previsto come tale anche dall'altro Stato. Il trasferimento può essere richiesto dallo Stato, ma non può in nessun caso avere luogo senza il consenso espresso del condannato. La Convenzione prevede, in ogni caso, che il detenuto non possa essere processato, arrestato e condannato per gli stessi fatti che hanno già determinato la condanna nell'altro Stato. Ci sono poi previsioni in relazione ai documenti da presentare a sostegno della domanda di trasferimento, alla lingua di traduzione degli atti, alle modalità di consegna della persona trasferita e così via. <p> Il disegno di legge di ratifica consta di quattro articoli che ineriscono, rispettivamente, all'autorizzazione alla ratifica, all'ordine di esecuzione, alla copertura finanziaria e all'entrata in vigore dei testi. Gli oneri, sulla base di una stima di 200 trasferimenti annui, sono valutati in circa 340.000 euro annui. <p> Da ultimo, si evidenzia come i due accordi bilaterali non presentino profili di incompatibilità con la normativa nazionale, né con l'ordinamento dell'Unione europea e con gli altri obblighi internazionali assunti dal nostro Paese. Segnalo che la Commissione affari esteri, emigrazione ha approvato una modifica al testo del disegno di legge, recependo il parere della Commissione bilancio. <p> Si propone pertanto l'approvazione da parte dell'Assemblea del provvedimento in esame.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5925982594490051, 0.40740177035331726]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, desidero iniziare il mio intervento con una noterella: anche guardando l'Assemblea questa mattina, mi viene infatti da dire che a volte è molto più succulento e appare più stimolante discutere della materia degli appalti quando si ha a che fare con le sanzioni penali e con i reati, mentre anche i media dedicano minore attenzione a questa materia quando si tratta di parlarne per cercare di correggere il sistema e individuare quei meccanismi che possano prevenire ed evitare di precipitare verso esiti di illegalità e verso le conseguenti sanzioni di carattere penale. È già stata sottolineata da chi mi ha preceduto l'importanza del provvedimento, per il quale credo debba essere rivolto un ringraziamento non retorico, ma sincero, nei confronti dei relatori, di tutta la Commissione e - mi si lasci dire - anche del Presidente, che ha guidato un lavoro importante, che ha consentito di consegnare all'Assemblea un testo che ha una sua coerenza, percepibile e leggibile, laddove una materia come questa, per l'addensarsi di interessi convergenti e allo stesso tempo divergenti (se mi si passa l'ossimoro) che si concentrano intorno al tema degli appalti, avrebbe potuto implodere in un coacervo di norme senza una loro chiara fisionomia e identità. Invece non è così e credo che la legalità, la trasparenza, la semplificazione, l'efficienza e la qualità siano i pilastri fondamentali che questo testo consegna alla nostra discussione e spero anche alla nostra approvazione. Negli interventi che mi hanno preceduto sono già stati ricordati alcuni elementi. Ne voglio evidenziare alcuni: per ciò che riguarda la legalità e la trasparenza è importante aver eliminato alcuni dei meccanismi che giustamente il dottor Cantone ha definito criminogeni, quali la facoltà del general contractor di nominare la direzione dei lavori nelle grande opere o il ricorso sistematico al meccanismo del massimo ribasso. Si sono dunque intaccati gli ingranaggi che hanno consentito il proliferare degli elementi corruttivi e il moltiplicarsi dei costi delle opere. Naturalmente il provvedimento non riguarda solo le opere pubbliche, ma mi soffermo particolarmente su questo aspetto, perché è quello che conosco meglio. Altrettanto importante, come è già stato ricordato, è la parte del provvedimento che mira, non solo a diminuire il numero delle stazioni appaltanti e a spezzare la catena che molto spesso lega le commissioni giudicatrici a coloro che presentano domanda nei bandi per ottenere l'aggiudicazione dei lavori, ma a conseguire l'obiettivo di diminuire e al tempo stesso riqualificare le stazioni appaltanti. Perché la grande questione posta dal provvedimento non ha soltanto a che fare con la prevenzione dei fenomeni di corruzione e di contiguità tra malavita, criminalità organizzata e sistema degli appalti, ma mira anche a restituire efficacia ed efficienza ad un sistema che purtroppo ci vede, per molto aspetti, delle cenerentole nel panorama europeo. Quindi, lo sforzo compiuto nella direzione della qualificazione delle stazioni appaltanti è davvero molto rilevante. Le cose da ricordare sarebbero moltissime: mi voglio soffermare, per concludere, su un paio di aspetti che ritengo cruciali. Il primo riguarda un passaggio a mio giudizio molto rilevante contenuto nel provvedimento in esame. Mi riferisco - e ne parlo, perché fui io a svolgere la dichiarazione di voto del Gruppo del <PARTY> sul cosiddetto sblocca Italia - al salto di qualità che oggi viene compiuto rispetto al sistema delle concessioni autostradali, che costituisce certamente una grande questione per questo Paese, anche se non la sola. Ora, aver coraggiosamente deciso di introdurre sostanzialmente il 100 per cento dell'evidenza pubblica in tutti i meccanismi che i concessionari in esercizio pongono in essere per effettuare i lavori, credo sia un salto di qualità nel segno della trasparenza molto importante, ma che aiuta anche l'organizzazione e la crescita del sistema delle imprese, questione altrettanto rilevante: sollecita, cioè, le imprese a confrontarsi con il mercato, a rafforzarsi e a crescere, anziché dedicare il proprio tempo a rintracciare i percorsi più utili per legarsi a cordate predeterminate che le collochino nella condizione di poter lavorare. Questo è un elemento fondamentale per il salto di qualità del nostro sistema. È molto importante anche avere stabilito che questo Paese deve arrivare a regime ad affidare le concessioni autostradali attraverso gare ad evidenza pubblica. Mi permetto di sottolineare, però, su questo punto, una necessità al Vice Ministro. Noi abbiamo bisogno di ripristinare con più solidità ed efficacia il sistema dei controlli e della vigilanza sulle concessioni autostradali; un sistema che, da quando è stato smantellato IVCA, è di fatto dormiente. Lo dico perché altrimenti possiamo prevedere i migliori meccanismi per l'affidamento delle concessioni, ma se poi nessuno controlla in maniera incisiva come le concessioni vengono svolte non risolviamo il problema. Affronto un ultimo aspetto, e concludo. Come credo si sarà notato - e io condivido questo approccio - in questo testo si affida un ruolo rilevante all'Autorità anticorruzione, e credo sia importante perché il sistema degli appalti purtroppo oggi registra una patologia grave che richiede questo esubero del ruolo di ANAC rispetto alle normali funzioni di controllo e di vigilanza, anche nel concorrere operosamente allo svolgimento e al funzionamento del sistema. Poiché le norme si fanno anche nella situazione contingente, condivido moltissimo questo approccio, ma voglio riprendere un'osservazione che ho fatto anche in Commissione. L'auspicio che io formulo è che questa terapia intensiva, cui oggi si ricorre mettendo mano a questo strumento e a questo coinvolgimento di ANAC, serva a portare nel più rapido tempo possibile il paziente fuori dalla condizione di malattia grave in cui oggi si trova per ritornare ad un sistema in cui oggi chi deve vigilare e controllare fa quello, e complessivamente un migliorato, semplificato e riqualificato sistema di stazioni appaltanti riesce a svolgere con piena autonomia il proprio mestiere. Questo sarebbe, infatti, l'indicatore migliore che l'Italia è guarita da una malattia che la trascina in fondo alle classifiche dell'Europa anche su questo versante, e finalmente è diventato un Paese normale in cui le imprese possono competere su un mercato trasparente e concorrere con l'amministrazione pubblica alla crescita complessiva del Paese e alla realizzazione di opere di buona qualità fatte in tempi certi, con costi certi e nella migliore armonizzazione con i territori in cui si vanno a collocare. Il provvedimento al nostro esame ci aiuta ad andare in questa direzione, e quindi mi pare vada accolto con tutta la positività del caso.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5281538963317871, 0.47184616327285767]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> MILO (<PARTY>).

Signor Presidente, vorrei sottolineare un fatto molto scioccante che ha avuto come protagonista una dottoressa della guardia medica di Trecastagni, in provincia di Catania, la quale è stata vittima prima di un'aggressione e poi di una vera e propria violenza da parte di un ragazzo ventiseienne che si era presentato in ambulatorio. Al riguardo segnalo che dal 2009 è stato redatto il «Dossier Violenza - storie di ordinaria follia» da parte dell'esecutivo nazionale della Federazione italiana medici di medicina generale, che reca una denuncia soprattutto relativa alle donne che si trovano nelle postazioni della guardia medica, spesso prese di mira. Ricordiamo in proposito un episodio avvenuto a Tor Bella Monaca nel 2010, quando una dottoressa di turno di barricò in stanza a causa di un malvivente che la minacciò di morte. Non entro nei dettagli per ragioni di tempo, ma vorrei sottolineare che la presidente della Federazione degli ordini dei medici, Roberta Chersevani, ha proposto ieri di spostare le guardie mediche all'interno delle stazioni dei carabinieri o nei commissariati di polizia per garantire la sicurezza sui luoghi di lavoro delle dottoresse, prese di mira perché sole e in ore notturne. Lo stesso tipo di esigenza si pone per altre professioni che sono a rischio di violenza: quelle di donne che operano da sole nei posti di polizia, come personale di sicurezza, dipendenti di ristoranti e hotel, tassiste, autiste di bus e così via. Si tratta di un problema che va sicuramente affrontato e approfondito, come ha chiesto in questi giorni la presidente Boldrini, che ha esortato le forze politiche a mettere in campo un provvedimento in cui si aumentino le tutele a favore delle donne e le misure interdittive per gli uomini violenti.

Sicuramente la pandemia, prima, e la guerra, ora, non hanno aiutato, ma era diventato consuetudine anche nelle legislature precedenti assistere a un'occupazione di spazi da parte dei vari Governi su competenze prettamente legislative, su temi che devono essere trattati nelle Aule parlamentari da coloro che sono eletti dai cittadini italiani e li rappresentano. Se il Parlamento trova dei miglioramenti rispetto al testo proposto dall'Esecutivo, tutti dovremmo lavorare nella stessa direzione. <p> Il provvedimento al nostro esame è fondamentale per l'ottenimento dei fondi del PNRR ed evitare anche che vengono avviate procedure di infrazione nei confronti del nostro Paese. È assolutamente necessario, però, capire dove sta il punto di equilibrio tra gli interessi dell'Europa e quelli dell'Italia, perché talvolta sono contrastanti e un semplice appiattimento su posizioni europeistiche non significa fare gli interessi dei nostri concittadini. <p> Cari colleghi, siamo franchi e consapevoli: senza una riforma della pubblica amministrazione per lo snellimento delle procedure e la sburocratizzazione non si andrà da nessuna parte. <p> ; una pubblica amministrazione spesso orientata al mantenimento del proprio status quo, che deresponsabilizza e scarica sui cittadini ogni genere di onere e di incombenza, quasi dimenticando che chi sceglie di lavorare in questo ambito dovrebbe avere come faro l'interesse dei cittadini piuttosto che diventare l'ufficio complicazioni affari semplici. Senza questa riforma anche il prezioso lavoro fatto con questo disegno di legge verrà annacquato. Oltre al tema delle concessioni balneari, balzato di più alle cronache giornalistiche, tra le misure affrontate ci sono i servizi pubblici locali, l'energia, i rifiuti, i trasporti e la sanità. I colleghi che mi hanno preceduto e quelli che seguiranno entreranno nel dettaglio e nel merito dei vari temi. Personalmente invece propongo una riflessione rispetto alle società in house per ricordare come spesso i Comuni spesso hanno costituito queste società perché il mercato non offriva soluzioni e non è o non era economicamente conveniente. Basti pensare ai servizi che collegano territori morfologicamente difficili da raggiungere. I lavori parlamentari hanno tenuto conto anche di questi aspetti. L'ultimo pensiero va al grande lavoro fatto sui temi della sanità, dove si è cercato di trovare un equilibrio partendo dall'esigenza fondamentale di assicurare percorsi di cura efficaci, appropriati e sicuri soprattutto nei casi di malattie particolarmente gravi e invalidanti. Il monitoraggio e il controllo di tutte le strutture che erogano servizi sanitari sono fondamentali per garantire la qualità delle prestazioni, l'equità di accesso e cancellare le opacità là dove si erogano prestazioni sanitarie con oneri a carico della finanza pubblica. È stato realizzato un lavoro molto importante sui farmaci equivalenti per renderli prontamente disponibili rispettando i diritti della proprietà intellettuale. La ricerca deve continuare a pieno regime nell'interesse di tutti. Infine, avviandomi alla conclusione, il sistema italiano di raccolta del sangue è un esempio di eccellenza a livello mondiale e, con le modifiche introdotte, si conferma il concetto di gratuità e volontarietà della donazione.

La povertà in cui un bambino vive, non per propria scelta, comporta un altissimo rischio di esclusione sociale e condanna una parte consistente della popolazione a un destino di marginalità. Questo determina per la società un carico di devianza, che può minare alla base qualsiasi possibilità di sviluppo economico e sociale dell'intero Paese. <p> L'investimento sul capitale umano è basilare per il futuro del Paese ed occorre metterlo in atto con interventi concreti di lunga durata e di ampio respiro, in luogo di finanziamenti sporadici e a pioggia. Occorrono programmi chiari, organici e valutabili, affinché gli stessi possano essere produttivi anche da un punto di vista economico. <p> La Convenzione sui diritti del fanciullo del 1989 definisce in modo organico i diritti fondamentali che devono essere riconosciuti e garantiti a tutti i bambini. La Convenzione in particolare si ispira a quattro principi prioritari: la non discriminazione, prevedendo che i diritti sanciti dalla Convenzione devono essere garantiti a tutti i minori senza distinzioni; l'interesse del bambino o adolescente deve avere la priorità in ogni iniziativa pubblica o privata; il diritto alla vita, alla sopravvivenza e allo sviluppo del bambino; il diritto dei bambini ad essere ascoltati in tutti i processi decisionali che li riguardano. <p> Una serie di strumenti di tutela e di controllo sui diritti dell'infanzia sono stati messi in atto in questi anni. Da più legislature è stata creata una Commissione parlamentare per l'infanzia, con il compito, fra gli altri, di vigilare sulla rispondenza della legislazione nazionale alla normativa fissata in sede di Unione europea e ai principi di cui alla Convenzione del 1989. È stata persino istituita l'Autorità garante per l'infanzia e l'adolescenza, al fine di assicurare la piena attuazione e la tutela dei diritti e degli interessi delle persone di minore età. Di recente la Camera, inserendo norme apposite nella legge di stabilità, ne ha rifinanziato le meritevoli attività. <p> Con la ratifica della Convenzione di Lanzarote il Parlamento ha inasprito le pene per lo sfruttamento e l'induzione alla prostituzione minorile, anche attraverso l'introduzione di due nuovi reati: l'istigazione a pratiche di pedofilia e di pedopornografia e l'adescamento di minorenni. <p> Tuttavia permangono limiti alle pari opportunità educative e di crescita, condizionate anche da un'eccessiva frammentazione di competenze in ordine alle questioni della famiglia, anche a causa di una serie di scelte sbagliate in materia fiscale, che non hanno posto la dovuta attenzione al rispetto dei diritti e alla condizione della vita dei minori. <p> Vanno definiti i livelli essenziali delle prestazioni, senza disuguaglianze nell'accesso, al fine di contrastare il divario tra Nord e Sud. Bisogna investire nel sostegno allo studio e rimuovere le cause della dispersione scolastica. <p> L'ISTAT ci dice che vivono in situazioni di povertà relativa 1.822.000 minorenni, pari al 17,6 per cento di tutti i bambini e gli adolescenti. Il 7 per cento dei minorenni, pari a 723.000 persone, invece, vive in condizioni di povertà assoluta. Tale situazione si differenzia molto a seconda del luogo di nascita: è del 10,9 per cento nel Mezzogiorno, a fronte del 4,7 per cento nel Centro e nel Nord del Paese. Secondo i dati più recenti, i giovani tra i diciotto e i ventiquattro anni che hanno abbandonano prematuramente gli studi o qualsiasi altro tipo di formazione sono 758.000. Il fenomeno dell'abbandono scolastico continua purtroppo a interessare in misura più sostenuta il Mezzogiorno. <p> Secondo le indagini dell'organizzazione Save the Children, siamo di fronte ad una vera e propria emergenza infanzia, per la quale quasi il 32 per cento dei bambini sotto i sei anni vive ai limiti della povertà e il 23,7 per cento vive in stato di deprivazione materiale. A contrasto di ciò, i dati del Ministero della salute evidenziano come il fenomeno dell'obesità inizi soprattutto in età precoce, tra i sei e i dieci anni, dimostrando come oltre uno su sei soffra della patologia. <p> Com'è ovvio, la famiglia ha un ruolo educativo basilare e insostituibile. I genitori che trascorrono la maggior parte del loro tempo libero dedicandosi ai propri figli impongono loro delle regole sane e dei sani principi; allo stesso tempo li tengono lontani dai tentacolari pericoli della rete, cioè di quei siti Internet considerati sconsigliabili. <p> Tuttavia, in generale, proteggere l'infanzia dalla povertà è un dovere etico e morale che dovrebbe essere prioritario per ogni Governo, poiché i bambini e gli adolescenti di oggi saranno i cittadini di domani e compromettere il loro avvenire vuol dire minare le basi e il futuro stesso della società. Una società che si rispetti deve anche essere in grado di attivare i cosiddetti ascensori sociali e valorizzare la meritocrazia facilitando l'accesso allo studio, senza costi, per i più meritevoli e il conseguente accesso alle carriere lavorative pubbliche e private. Lo stesso articolo 24 della Carta dei diritti fondamentali dell'Unione europea, ora parte integrante del Trattato di Lisbona, sancisce la preminenza del diritto del minore alla protezione e alle cure necessarie per il suo benessere. <p> Il dato ancora più drammatico della povertà in tutte le sue forme si manifesta con l'allontanamento dei minori dal nucleo familiare per l'indigenza della famiglia stessa. È un effetto sconvolgente, che dovrebbe bastare da solo a scuotere le coscienze e ad attivare nel più breve tempo possibile gli interventi, per garantire al minore di crescere nella sua famiglia, come previsto dall'articolo 315 -bis del codice civile, opportunamente introdotto dalla legge n. 219 del 2012, recante disposizioni in materia del riconoscimento dei figli naturali. A questo proposito, la Commissione giustizia del Senato, dopo un lungo dibattito iniziato nel mese di marzo 2014, ha licenziato il disegno di legge n. 1209, recante modifiche alla legge 4 maggio 1983, n. 184 in materia di adozione di minori da parte delle famiglie affidatarie, che sarà prossimamente al vaglio dell'Assemblea.

Chiediamo, quindi, con la nostra mozione un impegno serio del Governo su questi punti: assumere iniziative volte ad assicurare una maggiore integrazione delle diverse competenze; adottare iniziative tese al sostegno di progetti per l'incentivazione allo studio; adottare con urgenza politiche di crescita adeguate anche attraverso una maggiore destinazione di risorse economiche e strumentali; elaborare un piano strategico per il contrasto della povertà minorile e giovanile, contro la dispersione scolastica e per l'inserimento dei giovani nel mercato del lavoro; assumere iniziative per sviluppare i servizi integrativi volte a colmare il divario tra domanda e offerta di servizi delle singole Regioni; valorizzare in ogni modo il rapporto con le associazioni di volontariato radicate sul territorio; promuovere politiche in sostegno della famiglia, sopratutto di tipo fiscale; prevedere un'incentivazione delle attività sportive; incentivare una campagna di sensibilizzazione contro lo stile di vita sedentario; promuovere l'adozione di leggi nazionali volte a incentivare strumenti normativi ad hoc, al fine di oscurare siti Internet sospetti.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5280153751373291, 0.4719845652580261]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, signori Sottosegretari, onorevoli colleghi, in apertura del mio intervento occorre che io ribadisca oggi, come in tutta la storia di Forza Italia che, sia quando siamo stati al Governo che quando siamo stati all'opposizione, da forza politica seria e responsabile, ci siamo sempre schierati dalla parte della Nazione, delle Forze armate, della libertà e della democrazia. <p> Quanto sta accadendo dal 24 febbraio, come ricordato prima da più di un collega, sta riportando nel cuore dell'Europa la linea di frattura, non solo militare, ma anche politica e sistemica che ci eravamo illusi fosse stata superata con il crollo dell'Unione sovietica e del Muro di Berlino. Molti avevano ritenuto allora che le nuove pericolose sfide fossero solamente quelle portate dall'integralismo islamico, dopo l'attentato alle Torri Gemelle e in relazione alla recrudescenza del terrorismo. Si era creduto che i venti di guerra e di repressione potessero venire esclusivamente da qualche pericoloso dittatore in Corea del Nord o in Venezuela; si è ritenuto, a torto forse, che la madre di tutti i problemi fosse lo strapotere economico della Cina. <p> Non era stato capito o era stato sottovalutato il messaggio nato dalla fine di alcune egemonie politiche europee che avevano portato alla distruzione, per esempio, della ex Jugoslavia, una realtà federativa che accomunava etnie simili, ma diverse, che al venir meno del collante politico dato dal generale Tito si è trasformato in uno scontro armato senza quartiere, che ha infiammato l'ultimo decennio del secolo scorso. <p> L'Europa e l'Occidente avrebbero dovuto rispondere insieme a queste sfide sistemiche, che sono sfide ai nostri valori, alla nostra cultura e al nostro modo di vivere, esportando un'idea di Europa e di Occidente a tutti i popoli e a tutte le Nazioni di tradizione greco-romana e giudaico-cristiana, anche a quelli liberati dal gioco della dittatura comunista. <p> Per fare questo ci voleva e ci vuole capacità di intermediazione, arte della convergenza e visione strategica. Ci voleva, ci vogliono e ci vorranno interpreti capaci. In altre parole ci vuole leadership e ci vogliono i leader politici che creino le condizioni per la sua realizzazione. Consentitemi qui di dire che è fin troppo facile dire e riconoscere che un solo uomo, un solo leader illuminato e capace ha saputo interpretare questo nodo politico; solo Silvio Berlusconi capì che fra i Paesi della NATO e la Russia si dovevano porre le basi per una convergenza di prospettive e di interessi strategici e nel 2002, a Pratica di Mare, avviò questo processo virtuoso che avrebbe portato un futuro migliore per il mondo, per l'Europa e per l'Italia. Diceva Malcolm X che la storia è la memoria di un popolo e, senza una memoria, l'uomo è ridotto al rango di animale inferiore. Infatti solo chi non ha leadership politica non ne ha memoria. Pensare che le macerie del regime comunista, fatto di oppressione, di invasioni, di repressione, dalla carestia artificiale con la quale Stalin massacrò milioni di ucraini, la spietata repressione della resistenza patriottica anticomunista in Lituania, i carri armati russi a Budapest e a Praga, non segnassero profondamente il sentiment di quei popoli una volta affrancati dalla dittatura non solo verso il sistema comunista, ma verso il Paese con cui il sistema si identificava. Quei popoli che hanno scelto la libertà della democrazia si sono rivolti all'Europa, chiedendo di essere parte della nostra comunità di popoli liberi e noi abbiamo il dovere di essere dalla loro parte, con chi ha aderito all'Alleanza atlantica e con chi, come l'Ucraina, con l'Alleanza atlantica e l'Europa stava costruendo un rapporto di mutualità senza alcun significato ostile verso la Russia. Sull'origine di questo conflitto vi sono, in ogni caso, elementi oggettivi di discussione quali ad esempio le discriminazioni delle minoranze russe in alcune aree dell'Ucraina o il Battaglione Azov con i mercenari che esibiscono le svastiche.

La politica ha anche il dovere di impedire che nel terzo millennio vi siano guerre.

Lo strumento che si può utilizzare per raggiungere questo obiettivo è il listino dei candidati senatori che verrebbe votato nelle elezioni regionali contestualmente con la lista dei consiglieri regionali. Non solo: il nostro emendamento propone anche che i Presidenti delle Giunte regionali siano membri di diritto del nuovo Senato. Il modello proposto con questo emendamento si avvicina al Bundesrat, mentre invece - mi consentiranno i colleghi - l\\'attuale testo propone un modello paragonato impropriamente a tale ipotesi. All\\'elaborazione di questa proposta di emendamento hanno dato un contributo prezioso i senatori Quagliariello e Bruno, in una certa misura hanno contribuito anche i colleghi relatori Calderoli e Finocchiaro, il collega Chiti ed altri esponenti del <PARTY> e perfino Matteo Renzi che lo aveva evocato in un dei suoi speech. Poi, improvvisamente, la proposta è stata cestinata. Noi siamo andati a spulciare nel cestino, a \"spiegazzare\" questo foglietto e lo abbiamo ripreso nel dibattito. A volte succede che la proposta migliore era proprio quella cestinata. Questa è una buona proposta che è scaturita nel corso della discussione svolta in Commissione affari costituzionali ed è diversa da tutte le posizioni di partenza, sia da quella che voleva un\\'elezione diretta universale del Senato, sia rispetto a chi vuole invece un\\'elezione di secondo grado. Sarebbe quindi una di quelle invenzioni che maturano nei momenti migliori del dibattito costituzionale, quando si concorda su una proposta imprevista che mette tutti d\\'accordo senza che nessuno possa vantarne una primazia. Chiedo quindi che ci sia un momento di attenzione e di riflessione su questo emendamento e ciò sarebbe - se mi è consentito - non solo l\\'occasione per risolvere nel modo migliore un problema che ci ha molto impegnati nella discussione, ma anche un segnale per dare un clima nuovo alla nostra discussione.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5658019185066223, 0.4341980814933777]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, rappresentanti del Governo, onorevoli colleghi, ho ascoltato il dibattito e alcuni interventi mi hanno lasciato molto sorpreso. A essi dedicherò, quindi, due minuti, perché credo siano state fatte valutazioni assolutamente non condivisibili e lontane dalla realtà. <p> Desidero, però, in premessa dare atto al Governo, al presidente Marino e al relatore Zeller di aver consentito di svolgere in Commissione un lavoro molto proficuo, che ha visto tutte le forze di maggioranza e di opposizione contribuire positivamente al lavoro e al miglioramento del provvedimento oggi in esame. Do altresì atto al collega Carraro della sua correttezza, come sempre, perché interviene allo stesso modo in Commissione e in Assemblea. Egli, infatti, pur non mancando di manifestare dal suo punto di vista limiti e insufficienze, ha riconosciuto un lavoro positivo, a differenza di altri interventi in cui, al clima costruttivo registrato in Commissione, poi in Assemblea hanno fatto seguire veri e propri comizi di propaganda con insulti vari. <p> Su due punti i senatori Crimi e Carraro hanno iniziato e chiuso il dibattito. Il senatore Crimi ha mosso tutta una serie di rilievi critici, sottolineando la difficoltà di credito a sostegno dell'economia reale, soffermandosi sul tema della produttività e sulla necessità di ammodernamento dei macchinari industriali. Sono tutte situazioni assolutamente lontane dalla realtà, visto che il tema degli interventi sull'intero sistema del credito e sul rafforzamento del sistema bancario è teso a consentire il miglioramento del sostegno all'economia reale; dall'altra parte, i provvedimenti adottati, con la legge Sabatini e con il superammortamento, hanno determinato risultati molto positivi nel settore dei macchinari industriali, tanto che da questo punto di vista la ripresa è stata molto vigorosa e forte nel settore meccanico e manifatturiero in cui siamo leader a livello mondiale. Si ha, quindi, un doppio effetto positivo. Se poi vogliamo mettere in rilievo il tema della produttività che da venti anni attanaglia il nostro Paese, credo che le varie e diverse opinioni che si sono misurate hanno dato il senso della difficoltà, della situazione difficile che viviamo. Fino al 1995, infatti, la dinamica della produttività del nostro Paese è stata in linea con quella degli altri Paesi europei e negli ultimi venti anni registriamo una situazione di palude, di ristagno, che è un problema vero. Probabilmente ha ragione chi tra gli osservatori ha individuato la causa vera nel blocco, nella paralisi, nella mancanza di riforme che alla fine, nella competizione con la globalizzazione, e quindi con una competizione globale, tutto il nostro sistema Paese con le sue arretratezze (dalla pubblica amministrazione, al mercato del lavoro, alla formazione, al fisco e a quant'altro) ha scontato e continua a scontare. E solo adesso con la vigorosa stagione di riforme stiamo cercando di uscire da questa difficoltà. Sul tema del risparmio vorrei far notare al collega Carraro che, in una fase iniziale, abbiamo avuto una ricomposizione dello stock del risparmio delle famiglie che lo avevano consumato negli anni della crisi. In realtà i dati ci dicono che la ripresa del <PARTY>L, proprio a fronte delle difficoltà del commercio globale, è sostenuta dalla domanda interna, dalla ripresa dei mutui edilizi, del credito al consumo, dall'acquisto di automobili, di case e così via. C'è, in realtà, una ripresa di fiducia e di spesa, favorita anche da alcuni provvedimenti. È vero - come lei stesso ha sottolineato - che una parte importante del nostro Paese vive al di sotto della soglia di povertà e, quindi, occorrono provvedimenti che vanno dal reddito di inclusione sociale, al sostegno per i figli a carico, al sostegno ai redditi medio-bassi, al rinnovo dei contratti che, in realtà, servono non solo a dare spinta economica al Paese e fiducia alle persone, ma anche e soprattutto hanno la valenza di provvedimenti di giustizia sociale non più rinviabili. Il decreto-legge che oggi ci accingiamo a convertire in legge è un provvedimento importante che si colloca all'interno di un complessivo percorso di riforma del settore creditizio italiano, che a sua volta si inserisce nel più ampio processo in atto a livello europeo. A partire dagli inizi del 2015, il Governo ha avviato un processo di riforma teso a rendere gli istituiti creditizi più competitivi e a potenziarne il ruolo di supporto all'economia reale. In particolare, vanno ricordate la riforma delle banche popolari e la più recente riforma delle banche di credito cooperativo. Gli effetti positivi dell'azione riformatrice messa in campo con questi provvedimenti si osserveranno nei prossimi mesi, contribuendo in modo deciso al rafforzamento di tali banche e, in generale, del sistema bancario italiano, promuovendone il consolidamento patrimoniale, il miglioramento dei modelli di governance e dei sistemi di valutazione del merito di credito delle imprese, nonché l'aumento dell'offerta di finanziamenti. All'interno di questa strategia è bene ricordare che il Governo è poi intervenuto con diverse misure sul principale ostacolo alla ripartenza del credito, rappresentato dalla mole dei crediti deteriorati accumulatasi nei bilanci delle banche. In proposito, voglio ricordare il decreto-legge n. 83 del 2015 (cosiddetto decreto fallimento), che ha introdotto misure per rendere più efficienti il recupero dei crediti e facilitare il ricorso a forme negoziali di risoluzione delle crisi d'impresa, prevedendo la deducibilità piena e immediata delle perdite su crediti. Con quest'ultima previsione il trattamento fiscale delle svalutazioni sui crediti è stato allineato a quello degli altri principali Paesi, consentendo di accrescere gli accantonamenti sui prestiti deteriorati e di ridurre i disincentivi alla loro cessione. Il successivo decreto-legge n. 16 del 2016 (cosiddetto decreto banche) ha previsto un meccanismo di garanzia dello Stato, a prezzi di mercato, a copertura delle tranche senior emesse nell'ambito di operazioni di cartolarizzazione, realizzate a fronte della cessione da parte di intermediari finanziari di portafogli di crediti in sofferenza: un ruolo centrale nel favorire la cessione dei crediti non performanti e la creazione di un mercato efficiente di tali crediti, che potrà avvenire grazie all'importante ruolo che sarà chiamato a svolgere il Fondo Atlante. Si tratta di una strategia di ampio respiro che, in linea con le nuove misure europee, dovrebbe ricostruire un nuovo rapporto tra investitori e settore creditizio e tra quest'ultimo e l'economia reale, in modo da allinearli alle esigenze dell'attuale congiuntura economica. Una positiva notazione sistemica riguarda infine la circostanza che il provvedimento in conversione si inserisce in un complessivo ripensamento culturale delle diverse procedure che si attivano a fronte dei mancati pagamenti dei crediti. Il decreto-legge, infatti, arriva a poca distanza di tempo dal disegno di legge delega per la riforma organica delle discipline della crisi di impresa e dell'insolvenza dove, in linea con l'orientamento adottato dai principali ordinamenti europei, si è tentato di esprimere una nuova visione dello stato di difficoltà finanziaria, anche grave, visto come una possibile evoluzione fisiologica del ciclo dell'attività aziendale, da prevenire o gestire al meglio. Nel merito delle singole disposizioni, sono importanti le misure sulle procedure di insolvenza e sulle procedure esecutive, che si aggiungono a quelle già varate alcuni mesi fa, che, insieme all'istituto del cosiddetto patto marciano, contribuiranno a semplificare gli adempimenti e a snellire le procedure per il recupero dei crediti. Il complesso degli interventi avrà ripercussioni positive sull'economia reale in quanto le banche che rientrano più facilmente dei loro crediti avranno a disposizione spazi maggiori in bilancio per erogare prestiti alle imprese. Per quanto riguarda le ricadute sul sistema produttivo, vorrei ricordare un dato. La situazione italiana relativa ai crediti in sofferenza presenta delle peculiarità rispetto agli altri Paesi. Una risposta coerente non può che muoversi lungo due direttrici: velocizzare il recupero dei crediti delle banche verso le imprese, allineando i tempi italiani alle richiamate best practice internazionali; rendere più flessibile il sistema delle garanzie che assistono i finanziamenti, in modo da facilitarne l'ottenimento da parte delle imprese. La normativa introdotta e oggi in discussione è costruita intorno a queste due direttrici, rispondendo così a un'esigenza più volte rappresentata dalla classe imprenditoriale, cioè restituire efficienza e redditività al sistema creditizio in modo da garantire maggiore disponibilità di credito e migliori condizioni, a beneficio dell'economia reale. In particolare, le misure adottate potranno avere un impatto positivo non solo sull'apertura di nuove linee di finanziamento, ma anche per la rinegoziazione dei finanziamenti in essere. Grazie al testo in esame, sarà più facile per le imprese ottenere finanziamenti dagli istituti di credito, che possono contare su procedure semplificate e celeri per recuperare le somme erogate in caso di inadempimento nel pagamento delle rate. Il patto marciano prevede l'assegnazione stragiudiziale degli immobili dati a garanzia di un finanziamento ed è la novità più rilevante tra quelle del decreto-legge. Essa prevede la possibilità che, a fronte di un finanziamento, le parti stipulino un contratto di cessione di un bene quale garanzia della restituzione. In caso di inadempimento del debitore, la banca entra in possesso del bene con una procedura molto semplice, senza il passaggio per il sistema giudiziario; al debitore spetta comunque la differenza tra debito residuo e il valore del bene, che viene stimato da un perito indipendente, nominato dal giudice. Per il poco tempo a disposizione non mi dilungherò su altri aspetti importanti, che però sono stati sottolineati da vari interventi dei colleghi e dei relatori. Importanti sono, ad esempio, le misure che hanno impatto sui contratti di finanziamento già stipulati e sulla rinegoziazione di questi contratti; le misure di modifica della legge fallimentare e le procedure concorsuali, così come l'impatto che hanno altre misure importanti come il pegno non possessorio. Nella sostanza, il provvedimento in esame introduce elementi di riequilibrio funzionali del sistema giuridico ed economico in grado di favorire un effettivo fattore di sostegno all'economia reale, contribuendo al rilancio del tessuto produttivo del Paese. Si bilanciano gli interessi in gioco salvaguardando i principi di buona fede e correttezza contrattuale. Nell'attuale contesto economico è determinante assicurare che, a fronte di una corsia accelerata per il recupero dei crediti, si introducano presidi in grado di generare benefici concreti per le imprese in termini di ammontare, costo e durata dei finanziamenti, che dovranno risultare maggiormente sostenibili per le stesse imprese, contribuendo, in coerenza con la linea adottata dalla BCE, a delineare una politica nazionale per il credito anticiclica.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.570810079574585, 0.42918992042541504]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, il mio intervento si soffermerà su alcuni aspetti paradossali che stanno caratterizzando questa discussione rispetto a un provvedimento riconosciuto importante da tutti, sul quale, viceversa, ancora l'altro giorno è stata posta una questione pregiudiziale di costituzionalità e ieri la questione sospensiva per tentare di bloccarlo. <p> Il dibattito sul disegno di legge Zan sembra vertere su questioni di dettaglio, procedurali, di prassi parlamentare, sull'esagerata dilazione dei tempi o meno. Ce ne ha dato un saggio l'altro giorno il presidente Ostellari, rivendicando il ruolo del Senato, che non è chiamato a ratificare le deliberazioni della Camera dei deputati: giusto, corretto; non si capisce, però, l'atteggiamento ostruzionistico portato avanti in questi mesi dal Presidente della Commissione giustizia. <p> Il senatore Renzi si è spinto ancora oltre: ha ricordato che lui era per l'abolizione del bicameralismo perfetto ma, dopo l'esito del referendum, è diventato un campione del ruolo specifico del Senato, il quale, in pochi giorni, può fare una mediazione che non è stata possibile in otto mesi. Non solo. Secondo Renzi, il Senato può dar vita a un patto tra le forze politiche per una rapida approvazione anche alla Camera dei deputati. In queste schermaglie tutte politiche sono assenti i contenuti del provvedimento oggetto del nostro dibattito; sono messe in sordina tesi e antitesi che invece hanno riempito in questi mesi le pagine dei giornali, ma che non hanno avuto modo di essere approfondite in quest'Assemblea. Tutti riconoscono che il disegno di legge Zan è importantissimo, che non deve avere un intestatario politico, che non può rischiare il voto segreto, ma che deve essere votato alla luce del sole, dal più ampio schieramento di forze in ossequio all'ampia maggioranza che sostiene il Governo Draghi. Basta la volontà di entrare nel merito dei contenuti del disegno di legge Zan per capire, come è successo nel dibattito di questi due giorni, che il divario tra gli schieramenti politici è molto netto. Un grande filosofo della scolastica, Pietro Abelardo - mi viene in mente lui - constatato che su diverse questioni teologiche le sentenze dei padri della Chiesa erano spesso divergenti e qualche volta antitetiche, propose un metodo che sta ancora oggi alla base dell'insegnamento universitario: il metodo del sic et non, delle quaestiones disputatae, che portarono a quei quaderni quodlibet, fondamentali per la crescita e lo sviluppo del dibattito. Abelardo antepose al principio di autorità quello della ragione per venire a capo e prendere ragionevolmente partito su una tesi. Tutto il contrario, mi pare, di quanto si sta cercando di fare oggi in questo dibattito. Tra l'autorità del senatore Pillon, che contrappone la scienza all'antropologia, e quella del senatore Salvini, che proclama che all'interno di questo Senato non vi è alcun parlamentare che sostiene arcaiche discriminazioni di genere, non ci può essere mediazione. O rispetto alle affermazioni dell'autorità del presidente Ciriani, secondo il quale famiglia è unione tra uomo e donna in funzione della riproduzione c'è mediazione possibile rispetto all'autorità ancora del senatore Salvini, che accoglierebbe senza alcun problema a casa sua la compagna o il compagno di suo figlio? In politica la mediazione, lo sappiamo, è necessaria, ma essa non deve confondere le acque. Capisco che per un partito è meglio intestarsi una parte dei meriti per l'approvazione di un provvedimento riconosciuto come importantissimo, ma non sarebbe un disonore votare contro o astenersi quando vi sono ragionevoli dubbi. I clerici vagantes, per tornare al nostro Medioevo, alla fine della disamina delle varie e a volte opposte posizioni nel sic et non erano tenuti a prendere partito, che non era quello di una melassa impalpabile. Così si è affermato un metodo scientifico nelle nostre università. In caso contrario si inalbereranno vessilli identitari che alle quaestiones sostituiscono soltanto dei nomi. La ricaduta nominalistica non ci aiuta però a migliorare la conoscenza delle cose e, alla fine, se ci limitiamo ad essa, nomina nuda tenemus. Ad esempio, la parola genere dal latino genus e a partire dall'antico francese genre, diffusosi poi in inglese nella forma di gender, viene comunemente utilizzata per riferirsi a modelli di relazione, aspettative, vincoli e opportunità diverse tra uomini e donne. In questo si distingue dal sesso che invece rimanda alla natura biologica del maschile e del femminile, quindi alla dimensione fisiologica. Orbene, intorno al sintagma identità di genere, si va sviluppando una divaricazione oltremodo pretestuosa. Parrebbe che a metterlo in legge significherebbe aprire le porte ad una definizione culturale della diversità, mentre non ammetterlo limiterebbe la definizione di legge a quella avente caratteri biologici. Non è assolutamente così. Il dato della giurisprudenza è ben altro. Già i dati normativi attuali, la Corte costituzionale con sentenza n. 221 del 2015 in materia di rettificazione giudiziale dell'attribuzione del sesso ha affermato che il diritto all'identità di genere è elemento costitutivo del diritto all'identità personale, rientrante a pieno titolo nell'ambito dei diritti fondamentali della persona. Nello stesso senso la Corte si esprime con la sentenza n. 180 del 2017, nella quale ribadisce che va ancora una volta rilevato come l'aspirazione del singolo alla corrispondenza del sesso attribuitogli nei registri anagrafici al momento della nascita con quello soggettivamente percepito e vissuto costituisca senz'altro un'espressione del diritto al riconoscimento dell'identità di genere. <p> (ore 12) ( Segue MARILOTTI). Com'è arrivato il giudice delle leggi a tutto ciò? Con la solita invasione di campo della giurisdizione nei confronti del Parlamento? Non sembra proprio. Le Corti dicono questo partendo proprio dalla parola «genere», che è già presente nelle varie leggi e decreti vigenti da vari anni nel nostro ordinamento, come la legge elettorale per la Camera e il decreto-legge n. 93 del 2013. Nulla di più facile, quindi, che la parola «genere» sia accettata nella mediazione cui il senatore Salvini accennava, senza che il collega Pillon battesse ciglio, e una giurisprudenza coerente in pochi anni approdi ad applicare la legge Mancino anche all'identità di genere. Perché quindi tanto chiasso? Non è che sul rimandare o meno alla Camera il provvedimento si stanno per caso giocando partite, prove di tipo muscolare all'interno della maggioranza? Per concludere, sono assolutamente convinto che il disegno di legge Zan sia un provvedimento di civiltà, che ci aiuta a vivere in una società inclusiva, tollerante, rispettosa dei diritti di tutti, al di là e oltre i gruppi identitari che compongono la nostra variegata società.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5419835448265076, 0.4580164849758148]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, purtroppo, l'auspicato cambio di passo annunciato a più riprese da questo Governo non si è verificato e non si è concretizzato nei fatti. <p> Non posso che giudicare insufficienti le risposte che sono state date da questo decreto-legge sostegni, che fanno il paio sia con le misure restrittive sia con le claudicanti riaperture che hanno messo e mettono a rischio la sopravvivenza anche di tante imprese. <p> Non è razionale sostenere che si può salvare un'impresa dandole unicamente aiuti che corrispondono solitamente a una percentuale che va dal 2 al 5 per cento del calo di fatturato. <p> Come <PARTY> da mesi insistiamo sul fatto che l'unico modo per aiutare e supportare le aziende è intervenire sui costi fissi. Uno degli strumenti importanti, forse l'unico che aveva portato avanti bene questo Governo, era legato al superbonus del 110 per cento. È sicuramente uno strumento importante che serve per aiutare e può essere un volano per la nostra economia nazionale, oltre a rappresentare uno strumento strategico per raggiungere gli obiettivi della rigenerazione urbana. È quindi uno strumento che non deve essere assolutamente perduto, ma è un'occasione che va colta. <p> Come dicevo poc'anzi, deve essere un volano per l'economia nazionale, tanto è vero che abbiamo visto negli ultimi mesi come questo strumento abbia portato a un incremento, settimana dopo settimana. Facciamo qualche esempio: il 19 marzo gli interventi erano circa 6.500 per un ammontare di 733 milioni di euro e, solo dopo dieci giorni, siamo arrivati a un incremento di quasi il 40 per cento, passando a 9.207 interventi, per un valore di oltre un miliardo. Quindi, sicuramente il superbonus rappresenterebbe una misura anticiclica. <p> <PARTY> ha sempre ritenuto che, per rilanciare l'economia, e soprattutto per sostenere le imprese, fosse necessario incentivare i consumi e anche la produzione. Questa è la logica che di fatto sottende anche al superbonus; ma per poter arrivare a questo sono fondamentali due elementi: il primo è la proroga. È fondamentale una proroga al 2023 perché la scadenza è a giugno 2022, e questo andrebbe sicuramente a disincentivare tutti coloro che vogliono attingere. L'altro elemento importante per poter dare seguito al superbonus è sicuramente legato alla burocrazia e alla semplificazione. <p> Anche in questo caso il Governo ha annunciato, qualche settimana fa, il decreto-legge semplificazioni; quindi, sarebbe importante che il superbonus rientrasse in questa logica di semplificazione. <p> Soltanto da un punto di vista verbale c'è stato un impegno da parte del premier Draghi sia per quanto riguarda la proroga sia per quanto concerne il discorso della semplificazione. Un aspetto importante è quello di estendere la platea anche alle strutture ricettive, alle strutture alberghiere, ma un effetto legato al superbonus concerne l'andamento delle materie prime visto che i lavori stanno aumentando, quindi bisogna monitorare per evitare speculazioni. <p> Insomma, signor Presidente, in conclusione questo è un Governo che fa il contrario di quello che sarebbe giusto fare, ovvero non conferma l'unico bonus che avrebbe dovuto confermare, quello del 110 per cento. Ha invece elargito bonus a pioggia e nega il finanziamento dell'unico bonus che, come dicevo, sarebbe capace di garantire sviluppo e crescita. Dunque il Governo cammina al contrario, come un gambero, e rischia di andare a sbattere. Quello che però ci interessa e ci preoccupa è che ad andare a sbattere potrebbero essere gli italiani. Noi di <PARTY> non lo consentiremo e saremo vigili, affinché tale bonus possa effettivamente concretizzarsi, perché è fondamentale, proprio per creare un volano che serve a tutte le imprese, nel campo dell'edilizia, che rappresentano un asse portante della nostra economia.

Signor Presidente, speravo di modificare il giudizio negativo e invece sono costretto ad aggravarlo, non solo per i contenuti, ma anche per il metodo. Non partecipo al voto, ma rimango al mio posto, per rispetto dell'Aula e del mio partito. Il Governo ha impedito di apportare al testo quei miglioramenti che sarebbero stati ampiamente condivisi. L'Assemblea ha mostrato di non apprezzare. Molti colleghi hanno fatto sentire il dissenso solo con il voto segreto; peccato che non lo abbiano espresso alla luce del sole. D'altro canto, chi ha criticato in modo trasparente e leale è stato ricoperto di insulti a livello personale. Quando si tratta della Costituzione, è la qualità del dibattito a decidere in gran parte l'esito. Non era mai accaduto, nella storia repubblicana, che il Capo del Governo imponesse una sorta di voto di fiducia sul cambiamento della Carta. Aveva promesso di tagliare i costi della politica, ma ha deciso di non ridurre il numero dei deputati e questo cedimento ha creato uno squilibrio. La Camera diventa sei volte più grande del Senato e consente a chi vince le elezioni di utilizzare il premio di maggioranza per impossessarsi del Quirinale. Diciamo la verità: se Berlusconi avesse modificato la Costituzione indebolendo l'indipendenza della Presidenza della Repubblica avremmo riempito le piazze. <p> Nel ventennio appena trascorso non solo a destra, ma anche a sinistra, si è rafforzato il potere esecutivo a discapito del legislativo. Eppure la seconda Repubblica non aveva concluso l'opera; ci voleva un uomo nuovo per attuare il programma della vecchia classe politica. La crisi italiana non è istituzionale, è politica e dipende dalla mancanza di progetti chiari e distinti. La destra non ha realizzato il liberismo che aveva promesso e la sinistra non ha contrastato le disuguaglianze come le competeva di fare. I due poli hanno chiesto più poteri di governo, senza sapere cosa farne. Tutto ciò ha prodotto tante leggi, ma nessuna vera riforma. Il vuoto è riempito dalle illusioni mediatiche. La cancellazione del Senato elettivo è, sì, un incantesimo per far credere ai cittadini che ora le decisioni saranno più spedite e produrranno milioni di posti di lavoro, ma purtroppo la realtà è ben diversa. <p> Bisognava spendere la formidabile vittoria elettorale per ottenere la svolta in Europa. Avevamo tanto atteso il semestre a guida italiana; esso poteva dare un impulso all'iniziativa diplomatica, mentre si accendevano i fuochi di guerra ad Est e nel Mediterraneo. Invece si è bloccata la nomina del Ministro degli esteri europeo. Se il Premier avesse candidato Enrico Letta, prima che altri facessero quel nome, avrebbe dato prova di uomo di Stato che va al di là delle inimicizie personali. Torna il rischio di un avvitamento della crisi economica. Erano stati chiesti margini di flessibilità all'Europa, ma sono arrivate risposte negative. Il Governo italiano si è rassegnato, passando ad occuparsi solo del Senato, e oggi raggiunge il suo obiettivo. Il nostro ordinamento ne uscirà più confuso. Gli elettori non sceglieranno gli eletti e si indeboliranno i contrappesi che rendono forti le democrazie europee. Tuttavia c'è un lato positivo: l'incantesimo non serve più; da oggi si torna alla realtà; è finito l'alibi ventennale delle riforme istituzionali.

Qualche giorno fa, una cooperativa sociale ha chiesto al Mortara calcio di poter utilizzare gratuitamente lo stadio di Mortara. La richiesta che è stata fatta al Mortara calcio è stata anche motivata da una pressione da parte della prefettura. Di conseguenza, il Mortara calcio, di fronte alla parola \"prefettura\" si è tirato indietro e ha concesso, sbagliando, l\\'utilizzo dello stadio di Mortara, per poter fare gli allenamenti e svolgere le attività, ad una squadra di calcio o presunta tale fatta da migranti clandestini, persone che in questo momento non hanno la cittadinanza italiana. <p> MIRABELLI (<PARTY>). Sono richiedenti asilo! PRESIDENTE. Migranti va bene; richiedenti asilo e clandestini sa che non corrispondono. CENTINAIO (<PARTY>)... Migranti, clandestini, richiedenti asilo... utilizzate il termine che volete ma per me non sono italiani. Peccato che esiste a Mortara, come in tutti gli altri Comuni d\\'Italia, una convenzione che lega i rapporti tra la squadra di calcio e il Comune. Di conseguenza, il Comune concede annualmente - esiste questa convenzione apposita - l\\'utilizzo della struttura dello stadio di Mortara alla squadra per poter svolgere i campionati giovanili e i campionati a cui è iscritto il Mortara calcio. Tra le varie cose, i genitori dei bambini che giocano nella squadra del Mortara pagano una retta annuale per poter mandare i propri figli. Il sindaco Facchinotti, nel momento in cui apprende - non dal Mortara calcio né dalla cooperativa Faber, ma dal giornale locale - la costituzione di questa squadra e che la stessa utilizzerà, senza esserne autorizzata, lo stadio del Morara, immediatamente convoca il Mortara calcio e comunica l\\'impossibilità, da parte del Mortara, visto che esiste questa convenzione, a utilizzare lo stadio per far giocare le persone di cui abbiamo parlato prima. Non ci vedo niente di male, Presidente: un sindaco fa rispettare la legge, una convenzione. <p> Non c\\'è niente di sbagliato, niente di illegale, niente di razzista. Il sindaco Facchinotti ha fatto rispettare una convenzione, quindi ha fatto il suo dovere da sindaco, come dovrebbero fare tutti i sindaci d\\'Italia, da Bolzano a Lampedusa. <p> Quello che è successo ha dell\\'assurdo perché, nel momento in cui il sindaco Facchinotti dichiara, tra le varie cose, di non sapere chi siano queste persone e nemmeno cosa facciano, ha perfettamente ragione perché qualche giorno prima - e chi vive nella provincia di Pavia lo sa - sul giornale locale, il signor Garavaglia, presidente della cooperativa Faber, dichiarava che solo il cinque per cento dei suoi ospiti avrebbe ottenuto lo status di profughi e che gli altri erano clandestini (parole virgolettate del signor Garavaglia, e non di Gian Marco Centinaio o della Provincia pavese). Quindi, il signor Facchinotti, sindaco di Mortara, fa rispettare semplicemente la legge. Si scatena il finimondo da parte di chi non sa che ci sono leggi da far rispettare (ahimè per loro); un finimondo allucinante che alcuni colleghi senatori presentano un\\'interrogazione parlamentare al Ministro, tra cui chi rideva prima. Nell\\'interrogazione si chiede al Ministro come mai è stato revocato l\\'uso del campo. Ebbene, l\\'uso del campo non è mai stato revocato - la gente si informi prima di parlare - piuttosto non è mai stato autorizzato.

Penso che i colleghi del <PARTY>, tanto loquaci nelle trasmissioni televisive, dovrebbero informarsi prima di parlare di questa persona, perché il signor Facchinotti, sindaco di Mortara, ex assessore alla cultura della Provincia di Pavia, è uomo mite, persona di cultura non solo apprezzata dai militanti della Lega e dai suoi cittadini ma anche da quei militanti del <PARTY> che in questo momento si stracciano le vesti per andare dietro ad una notizia e soprattutto che avrebbero dovuto informare i signori senatori, che tanto dicono e tanto fanno ma non conoscono il signor Facchinotti.

Per quanto riguarda i profili di interesse della 5ᵃ Commissione, l'articolo 1, comma 2, del decreto-legge prevede la copertura dell'incremento del contributo dello Stato ai Comuni, attraverso la riduzione di 118,156 milioni di euro del Fondo per le esigenze urgenti e indifferibili e di 6,844 milioni di euro del Fondo per gli interventi strutturali di politica economica. <p> L'articolo 2- bis reca il differimento del termine per la deliberazione del bilancio di previsione per l'esercizio 2014 degli enti locali, dal 30 aprile 2014 al 31 luglio 2014. Consentitemi una battuta da ex assessore al bilancio: la proroga è necessaria per una colpa nostra, perché lo Stato non fornisce in tempo utile tutte le informazioni utili affinché gli enti locali adottino il bilancio di previsione. Ricordiamo che è un dovere, ma è anche un diritto dei Comuni essere in grado di poter esprimere il proprio bilancio e poter lavorare in modo ordinato all' interno delle proprie comunità. L'articolo 3 reca numerose modifiche al testo unico degli enti locali, finalizzate a dare maggiore flessibilità alla procedura di riequilibrio finanziario pluriennale per gli enti locali: si ammette la presentazione di un nuovo piano, anche a seguito del diniego da parte del consiglio comunale o della Corte dei conti; si ampliano i tempi nei quali l'ente locale può avvalersi della procedura per il riequilibrio; si consente l'attivazione di mutui oltre i limiti vigenti; si permette una rimodulazione dei piani in taluni casi. Inoltre, per i Comuni con più di 20.000 abitanti che programmino una riduzione di almeno il 20 per cento dei costi dei servizi e la razionalizzazione delle società partecipate, si consente che raggiungano l'equilibrio entro un periodo massimo di tre anni. Si amplia, infine, la possibilità per le società controllate di applicare processi di mobilità tra società, eliminando il vincolo della coerenza con il rispettivo ordinamento professionale. (Brusìo). PRESIDENTE. Senatore Romani, la invito ad abbassare il tono della voce. ZANONI, relatrice. Grazie, signora Presidente. L'articolo 3- bis riduce l'entità minima del Fondo svalutazione crediti per gli enti locali e l'entità del Fondo svalutazione crediti per gli enti locali beneficiari delle anticipazioni di liquidità concesse per il pagamento dei debiti pregressi maturati da tali enti, rispettivamente dal 25 al 20 per cento e dal 30 al 20 per cento dei residui attivi di cui ai titoli I e III dell'entrata, aventi anzianità superiore a 5 anni. Questo è un provvedimento fortemente atteso dagli enti locali, che hanno grosse difficoltà ad esplicare questa norma in breve tempo, specialmente per ciò che riguarda gli enti molto grandi. L'articolo 4 prevede una specifica procedura di riassorbimento graduale delle somme attribuite al personale delle Regioni e degli enti locali in violazione dei vincoli finanziari imposti alla contrattazione collettiva integrativa. I commi da 3- bis a 3- quater ammettono il pagamento, da parte di Regioni ed enti locali, delle prestazioni dei lavoratori socialmente utili per le retribuzioni maturate nel periodo 2010-2013, nel rispetto del Patto di stabilità interno e garantendo, comunque, la salvaguardia degli equilibri di bilancio. L'articolo 5 consente agli enti locali, per gli anni 2014 e 2015, di assumere nuovi mutui e accedere ad altre forme di finanziamento reperibili sul mercato, oltre i limiti dell'8 per cento delle entrate fissati dal testo unico degli enti locali per un importo non superiore alle quote di capitale dei mutui e dei prestiti obbligazionari precedentemente contratti, rimborsate nell'esercizio precedente. Questa è una misura molto attesa, anche ai fini di innescare di nuovo la leva dello sviluppo nelle comunità. L'articolo 7 introduce disposizioni di verifica del gettito IMU per l'anno 2013. Considerato che ovviamente i bilanci 2013 sono già chiusi, pregherei il Governo di fare attenzione sulle modalità di applicazione. L'articolo 8 prevede l'erogazione ai Comuni delle Regioni a Statuto ordinario ed ai Comuni della Regione siciliana e della Regione Sardegna di un anticipo del 20 per cento di quanto spettante per l'anno 2014 a titolo di Fondo di solidarietà comunale. L'articolo 9 riduce, a decorrere dall'anno 2014, il contributo ordinario spettante agli enti locali nella misura di 7 milioni per le Province e di 118 milioni di euro per i Comuni. L'articolo 10 conferma, per l'anno 2014, le modalità di riparto alle Province del Fondo sperimentale di riequilibrio, già adottate con decreto ministeriale del 4 maggio 2012. Sono altresì confermate le riduzioni di risorse per la revisione della spesa ed i trasferimenti per le Province siciliane e sarde. L'articolo 11 modifica la disciplina della relazione di fine mandato provinciale e comunale al fine di semplificarne la procedura di redazione e pubblicazione. Permettetemi un inciso al riguardo: la relazione di fine mandato è uno strumento importante di trasparenza; renderlo più semplificato probabilmente agevola i Comuni nella sua redazione, che peraltro appare davvero importante ai fini della trasparenza politica e amministrativa. L'articolo 12, comma 1, interviene sulla decorrenza dell'erogazione del contributo straordinario per le fusioni di Comuni; al comma l- bis destina alla Regione Emilia-Romagna le somme iscritte in conto residui per l'anno 2014 sul fondo destinato all'erogazione di contributi alle persone fisiche per la riduzione del prezzo della benzina e del gasolio per autotrazione alla pompa, quale contributo straordinario pari a 2 milioni di euro. L'articolo 13 prevede che il finanziamento attribuito al Comune di Lampedusa e Linosa a valere sul Fondo di sviluppo delle isole minori, per le annualità 2008 e 2009, venga interamente erogato e destinato alla realizzazione di interventi urgenti del Comune connessi all'accoglienza dei profughi e ai bisogni primari della comunità isolana. L'articolo 14 interviene sulla disciplina del Fondo di solidarietà comunale, stabilendo che il 10 per cento del Fondo in esame sia ripartito tra i Comuni sulla base dei fabbisogni standard, specificando che occorre tenere conto anche delle capacità fiscali. Anche questa è una disposizione importante, che riflette il lavoro fatto dalla Commissione bicamerale sul federalismo fiscale circa la definizione dei fabbisogni e dei costi standard. L'articolo 15, comma 1, chiarisce che, per le Province che nel 2009 sono state interessate dallo scorporo di Province di nuova istituzione, l'obiettivo del Patto di stabilità interno è calcolato assumendo a riferimento la spesa corrente del biennio 2010-2011, anziché del triennio 2009-2011; al comma l- bis prevede un'attenuazione delle sanzioni per le Province che non hanno rispettato il Patto di stabilità. L'articolo 16 contiene le disposizioni su Roma Capitale. Credo si sia arrivati ad un giusto equilibrio fra la necessità di aiutare e sostenere il Comune di Roma a superare le difficoltà di bilancio e la necessaria assunzione di responsabilità da parte del Comune stesso con un piano triennale che prevede la riduzione del disavanzo e il riequilibrio strutturale di bilancio, misure per la gestione dei rifiuti, sulle società controllate e partecipate, sull'evasione tributaria e tariffaria. Infatti, si prevede che il Comune trasmetta, entro il 4 luglio 2014, un rapporto che evidenzi le cause della formazione del disavanzo e adotti un piano triennale per la riduzione del disavanzo e per il riequilibrio strutturale di bilancio, che deve essere approvato con decreto del Presidente del Consiglio dei ministri. Si autorizza, inoltre, il commissario straordinario del Governo per il Comune di Roma ad inserire, nella massa passiva del debito del Comune di Roma, ulteriori partite debitorie per complessivi 115 milioni di euro. Si prevede, infine, la finalizzazione di risorse, pari a 12 milioni di euro nel 2014 e 10,5 milioni di euro nel 2015, per assicurare l'attuazione di interventi previsti per superare la crisi in atto nella gestione dei rifiuti nel territorio di Roma, previa validazione da parte del Ministero dell'ambiente del programma di lavoro triennale sulla raccolta differenziata. L'articolo 17 prevede il pagamento, da parte dello Stato, a Trenitalia dell'importo di 13,4 milioni di euro per corrispettivo dei servizi resi nei primi sette mesi del 2014 in Valle d'Aosta. L'articolo 18 reca, al comma 1, disposizioni volte a limitare, nell'anno 2014, l'applicazione di talune sanzioni previste dalla normativa vigente per il mancato rispetto del Patto di stabilità nei confronti dei Comuni di Venezia e Chioggia. Il comma l- bis reca una norma di interpretazione autentica del comma 76 dell'articolo 1 della legge n. 311 del 2004, concernente le modalità di iscrizione in bilancio del debito e del ricavo derivante dai mutui. L'articolo 19 proroga al 31 marzo 2014 (in luogo del 28 febbraio 2014 originariamente previsto) il termine fissato dalla legge di stabilità 2014 per la prosecuzione dei contratti stipulati dalle istituzioni scolastiche ed educative statali per l'acquisto di servizi di pulizia ed altri servizi ausiliari. Il comma l- bis prevede che le risorse destinate dall'articolo 18, comma 8- bis, del decreto-legge n. 69 del 2013 alla messa in sicurezza degli edifici scolastici, pari a 3,5 milioni di euro per ciascuno degli anni 2014, 2015 e 2016, siano anche finalizzate a garantire la prosecuzione delle attività di monitoraggio del rischio sismico. Si prevede, inoltre, che il decreto di attuazione non debba più individuare gli istituti cui affidare le predette attività. L'articolo 20 reca alcune agevolazioni finanziarie in favore della Provincia e del Comune dell'Aquila, nonché degli altri Comuni del cratere, colpiti dal sisma dell'aprile 2009. L'articolo 20- bis destina una quota delle risorse del Fondo per lo sviluppo e la coesione, pari a 50 milioni di euro, che si renderanno disponibili a seguito della verifica sull'effettivo stato di attuazione degli interventi previsti nell'ambito della programmazione 2007-2013, al finanziamento del Fondo per le emergenze nazionali. Per tutto quanto detto, e con la consapevolezza che il provvedimento ha tenuto conto del dibattito e delle osservazioni che il Senato ha espresso nelle discussioni sui cosiddetti provvedimenti salva Roma 1 e 2, ritengo che questo provvedimento sia necessario e urgente per gli enti locali, le Regioni e per il Paese e che vada votato nella sua interezza.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5448347330093384, 0.45516520738601685]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> LAI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, sono stato stimolato dal collega Sonego a intervenire su questo tema. Condivido molto quello che lui ha sottolineato essere una preoccupazione, nel senso che siamo ovviamente d'accordo sulla necessità di rivedere con una delega al Governo tutte le normative che riguardano la materia degli incentivi fiscali, previdenziali e contributivi delle imprese marittime, però quel comma b), oltre ad avere dubbi di legittimità, per quanto ci riguarda, interviene su uno stato del mercato dei trasporti che è già ben configurato. Di fatto c'è un duopolio rispetto al quale, con una norma siffatta, il Parlamento sceglierebbe uno dei due soggetti in maniera evidente e senza passare attraverso la Commissione competente. Dico di più. Mi è stato detto che questa norma favorirebbe la continuità marittima in Sardegna. A tal proposito segnalo che la continuità marittima in Sardegna non funzionava con un solo soggetto; oggi inizia ad essere un sistema più competitivo perché ci sono almeno due soggetti che competono. Sarebbe bene favorirne ancora di più, anche perché i prezzi per connettersi alla Sardegna nel periodo turistico o per il trasporto merci continuano a essere piuttosto alti, e non sarebbero certo favoriti dal fatto che si privilegi uno dei due soggetti dell'attuale duopolio. La proposta che mi sento di fare al Governo dunque è che la lettera b) venga ritirata o votata separatamente. L'emendamento può essere mantenuto come sistema della delega, senza la lettera b). Altrimenti, in caso contrario, sentiti il dibattito in Commissione bilancio nelle settimane scorse e il parere di molti colleghi, un voto di astensione sarebbe il minimo di fronte al mantenimento della proposta emendativa nella sua attuale formulazione. PRESIDENTE. Senatore Lai, propone di votare l'emendamento per parti separate? LAI (<PARTY>). Ciò che non è condiviso è il comma 10- ter, lettera b). PRESIDENTE. Invito il relatore e il rappresentante del Governo a pronunziarsi sugli emendamenti presentati.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5487962961196899, 0.45120367407798767]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> FRAVEZZI (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, è con convinzione che il Gruppo Per le Autonomie (SVP, UV, PATT, UPT)-PSI-MAIE voterà a favore della proposta di risoluzione n. 5 presentata dalla maggioranza, che approva il Documento di economia e finanza. Questa convinzione è confortata dalla presenza di un quadro macroeconomico finalmente più favorevole, che è stato appunto ampiamente illustrato dal relatore e dal vice ministro Morando. È una conferma che le misure adottate nell'ultimo periodo stanno dando i risultati attesi e che sia possibile cogliere alcune opportunità per favorire una vera e propria crescita. Per essere chiari, con queste affermazioni non nascondiamo i problemi che ancora impediscono alla nostra economia di avviare una fase di crescita sostenuta, ma piuttosto intendiamo ribadire e condividere quanto contenuto nella premessa al DEF e cioè che ci siamo lasciati alle spalle una situazione drammatica, un'economia in recessione e che siamo pronti a ripartire, a cambiare marcia, tant'è che per parlare di vera ripresa economica, di crescita, di recupero e di competitività è necessario attendere gli effetti che produrranno effettivamente le riforme messe in campo dal Governo e quelle in via di attuazione. Si tratta di riforme importanti sulle quali non solo il Governo, ma anche l'intero Parlamento si stanno giocando, a nostro parere, la propria credibilità a livello nazionale ed europeo. Sarà l'attuazione di queste riforme che, innovando il nostro assetto istituzionale, amministrativo, sociale e fiscale, creerà le condizioni per ottenere maggiori margini di flessibilità, come previsto dal regolamento del 1997 e non dall'altro giorno. Finalmente abbiamo a che fare con una Commissione che sa interpretare in maniera più intelligente le regole che ci siamo dati fino dall'entrata nell'euro. È un'occasione da non perdere se vogliamo che nel prossimo DEF compaia a pieno titolo la parola «crescita». Il nuovo indirizzo della Commissione europea offre ulteriori opportunità per l'aumento dell'occupazione avendo optato per una scelta che rappresenta una discontinuità rispetto al passato e che aveva visto solo un'unica politica: la politica dell'austerità. Le tre direttrici sulle quali si muove il programma della Commissione (la responsabilità fiscale, la politica degli investimenti e le riforme strutturali) rappresentano un'occasione importante anche e soprattutto per il nostro Paese. In questa logica vanno considerate le iniziative contenute nel piano Juncker e che da ultimo hanno portato all'istituzione del Fondo europeo per gli investimenti strategici, nonché il cosiddetto quantitative easing, avviato da Mario Draghi e dalla Banca centrale europea. Se ci muoveremo nel solco tracciato dalla Commissione e dalla stessa Banca centrale europea, che ci mette a disposizione vari strumenti di intervento anche nell'economia reale, e attueremo il programma di riforme individuate dal Governo, saremo in grado di accelerare il processo di crescita in maniera effettiva e soprattutto con una ricaduta nell'economia delle persone, delle famiglie e delle imprese. Come riportato infatti da un'importante agenzia di rating, il potenziale economico del nostro Paese è elevato e il nostro rating potrebbe migliorare qualora le prospettive sostenute e indotte dal processo riformatore in corso facessero registrare un effettivo rafforzamento dell'economia reale. Ma per dare solidità e prospettiva alla crescita, oltre alle richiamate riforme strutturali, come peraltro si rileva nel DEF, riteniamo sia importante rilanciare soprattutto gli investimenti pubblici e privati, un passaggio fondamentale soprattutto per incentivare una domanda aggregata interna. Per dare una svolta e fornire un contributo stabile e consistente dovremmo però crescere del 3 per cento del <PARTY>L, come qualcuno sostiene, e questa è la sfida che abbiamo di fronte nei prossimi anni. Abbiamo però anche a disposizione ben 13,6 miliardi di euro, che possono essere utilizzati, come diceva il neo-Ministro delle infrastrutture, avviando nuovi investimenti o ribadendo e realizzando quelli previsti. A tal proposito voglio ricordare in particolare i corridoi multimodali e soprattutto - per quanto riguarda un'opera che sta molto a cuore al nostro territorio e che è stata ribadita nella legge di stabilità - la prosecuzione della galleria del Brennero e le sue tratte d'accesso. Ciò sarà fondamentale per collegare il Nord e il Sud dell'Europa: grazie a queste infrastrutture possiamo crescere e ridare prospettive all'economia. Pertanto consideriamo questo come un periodo di transizione, nel quale le misure fino ad oggi approvate non hanno ancora dispiegato tutti i propri effetti: penso in particolare ad alcune misure contenute nella legge di stabilità per il 2015 e che ci auguriamo siano estese anche agli anni successivi, come la decontribuzione per le imprese che assumono a tempo indeterminato e l'eliminazione del costo del lavoro dalla base imponibile IRAP, che, congiuntamente alle norme in corso di emanazione contenute nel jobs act, stanno iniziando a dare i primi frutti; basta leggere le agenzie di stampa di oggi. È fuor di dubbio che anche il venir meno della precarizzazione del lavoro produrrà effetti positivi sugli investimenti e in particolare sul settore dell'edilizia e sul mercato immobiliare, aiutando moltissimo questa filiera fondamentale dell'economia nazionale. Sarà soprattutto importante che i decreti attuativi del jobs act siano emanati secondo il cronoprogramma previsto dal programma nazionale di riforme e sarà altrettanto importante che non si rimanga imprigionati troppo a lungo nelle maglie di una certa burocrazia. Non mi riferisco a tutta la burocrazia, ma sicuramente ad una certa burocrazia, che spesso è sinonimo di impedimento. Per questo crediamo sia fondamentale, anzi strategico, approvare al più presto la riforma della pubblica amministrazione, che a nostro parere consentirà di tagliare inutili lacci e laccioli e, soprattutto, di intervenire sulle cosiddette spese inutili e improduttive. Dare certezza nelle procedure e nei tempi significa offrire le necessarie garanzie a tutti coloro che intendono investire nel nostro Paese. Una pubblica amministrazione più efficiente al servizio reale delle imprese e dei cittadini sarà la struttura portante del nuovo sistema Paese. Per le stesse ragioni riteniamo necessarie le riforme strutturali già avviate e le nuove iniziative, che avranno effetti anche per la crescita e la sostenibilità del debito. Mi riferisco in particolare a quelle che riguardano la giustizia civile e la cosiddetta delega fiscale, che sarà strategica, per come verrà declinata in maniera definitiva da parte del Ministero. Infine mi preme fare anche un accenno al cosiddetto tesoretto, previsto grazie al miglior andamento del <PARTY>L. In questi giorni abbiamo ascoltato diverse proposte, alcune delle quali molto fantasiose e di cui si è parlato anche durante le audizioni che si sono svolte in questi giorni nelle Commissioni. Per questo abbiamo ascoltato con molta attenzione le reali intenzioni del Governo in merito al suo utilizzo. Le dichiarazioni del Ministro, oggi ribadite dal Vice Ministro, hanno infatti fornito l'indicazione puntuale che esso sarà utilizzato per misure con effetti temporanei sul bilancio, in coerenza con il processo di riforme. Lo consideriamo ragionevole e riteniamo che ciò significhi definirlo meglio con scelte coerenti e duttili, che dovrebbero consolidare la ripresa. Pertanto, a nostra parere, tali risorse potrebbero essere canalizzate verso attività produttive in grado di aiutare settori in espansione: mi riferisco, in particolare, agli investimenti sulla cosiddetta banda larga, a settori strategici come quello agricolo nell'anno dell'Expo, prevedendo magari una maggiore estensione dell'esenzione IMU mi riferisco anche all'idea riguardante le sofferenze bancarie, mediante aiuti di Stato, secondo le possibilità consentite dalle normative europee, visto che il nostro sistema non è stato finanziato all'inizio della crisi delle banche e che in questo momento tale intervento potrebbe essere utile per far ripartire le politiche del credito. Ovviamente si tratta di interventi che, a questo punto, potranno invece agevolare la ripresa. Mi sia consentito, infine, un accenno ad una questione che ci sta particolarmente a cuore e che anche nel DEF viene ribadita: mi riferisco alla questione di fare, finalmente, un contrasto vero al fenomeno dell'evasione e dell'elusione fiscale. Infatti, le misure fino ad oggi messe in campo dal Governo e quelle previste nella delega sono finalizzate a creare un sistema più equo, trasparente, semplificato e orientato, appunto, alla crescita. Certo, mancano ancora alcuni tasselli per completarlo, ma auspichiamo un'accelerazione del percorso volto ad ottenere, finalmente, un sistema caratterizzato da certezza, stabilità, riduzione e semplificazione degli adempimenti tributari. Quindi, riteniamo essenziali queste tre riforme e questi tre elementi, che riguardano, appunto, il sistema fiscale, quello del lavoro e quello della giustizia civile. PRESIDENTE. Deve concludere, senatore. FRAVEZZI (<PARTY>). Queste sono tre riforme che, nell'immediato, possono dare un risultato. Pertanto, come ho detto in premessa, noi voteremo convintamente la risoluzione n. 5, proposta dalla maggioranza.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5146540403366089, 0.4853459894657135]}, {'sequence': 'Domando di parlare. <p> TRONTI (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, nel lavorare a questa riflessione e a questo ricordo, mi sono tornati in mente i passaggi della storia nostra che anche noi qui, a volte, rischiamo di dimenticare. Ricorda Gaetano Arfè, in un saggio sulla Rivista storica italiana, che Piero Gobetti dedica a Giacomo Matteotti addirittura un numero della sua grande rivista «Rivoluzione liberale», il 1° luglio 1924, ad appena venti giorni di distanza dal delitto. Il profilo di Matteotti scritto dallo stesso Gobetti delineava per l\\'occasione un quadro del socialismo riformista mutuando molti motivi della polemica tra Salvemini e Gramsci. Scriveva Gobetti: «Egli (Matteotti) fu il solo socialista italiano (preceduto da Gaetano Salvemini) per il quale il riformismo non fosse sinonimo di opportunismo». Il saggio di Arfé porta questo titolo: «Giacomo Matteotti uomo e politico». È in questa sintesi di umanità e politica che credo vada riportata alla memoria questa figura: primo simbolico martire dell\\'antifascismo, ma anche politico di razza, che fa da giovanissimo la scelta di vita dell\\'impegno pratico a favore delle condizioni di vita e di lavoro delle classi popolari. Quando Matteotti nasceva, esplodeva nelle sue terre, il Polesine, quel movimento di giusta, anche se di esasperata protesta che andrà sotto il nome, e il grido, «La boje!». Rimase sempre appassionatamente dentro questa tradizione, che è appunto la storia di quel riformismo socialista, intransigente e radicale, pur nel suo gradualismo, la cui base sociale si collocava nelle campagne della Valle padana. Si è detto che, come per Gramsci il primo riferimento sarà il proletariato industriale, per Matteotti fu quel proletariato bracciantile sfruttato e tuttavia dignitoso, politicamente avanzatissimo nelle sue forme di lotta e di organizzazione. Quello che per Gramsci erano i consigli di fabbrica, per Matteotti erano i comuni e le leghe. Da esperto amministratore locale arrivò a proporre un consorzio di comuni: i nostri soviet, li chiamerà nel congresso di Bologna del Partito socialista. E vedeva nelle campagne padane come una grande città: la città diffusa, non urbanisticamente, come si dice oggi, ma socialmente. I suoi piedi di agitatore e di studioso furono sempre piantati su questo fecondo terreno. Si occupa di patti agrari, di scuole, di strade, di telefoni. Luigi Einaudi, con cui Matteotti ebbe fiere polemiche, rese omaggio postumo alle sue competenze in materia finanziaria, all\\'abito scientifico con cui affrontava i problemi, lontano dalla faciloneria e dalla demagogia. Matteotti, fortemente contrario alla guerra, come è stato qui ricordato, e duramente polemico con gli esponenti, anche socialisti, dell\\'interventismo democratico, fu tra i primi ad apprezzare i geniali scritti di Keynes sulle «Conseguenze economiche della pace» e sulle critiche alle devastanti sanzioni imposte alla Germania sconfitta. È stato ricordato che nel 1919 venne eletto deputato. Nell\\'ottobre del 1922, a seguito dell\\'ulteriore scissione del partito, dopo quella di Livorno, viene eletto segretario del Partito socialista unitario. Qualche giorno prima, sul giornale «La Lotta» di Rovigo aveva scritto: «Mi vergogno che i nostri congressi dedichino tutto il loro tempo a queste diatribe; che non si pensi ad altro che a scissioni. Il proletariato deve essere unito: un blocco solo, anche sotto la tempesta ». Già nel marzo del 1921, nel corso di un\\'aspra lotta sindacale, nel Polesine, subisce un\\'aggressione. Viene caricato su un carro dai fascisti, malmenato, minacciato di morte, abbandonato in aperta campagna. Il 10 giugno del 1924, l\\'agguato fatale, il rapimento e l\\'assassinio. Due anni prima, nel 1922, la stessa sorte era toccata a Walther Rathenau, l\\'eccezionale politico e intellettuale, allora ministro degli esteri, ad opera di un gruppo di nazionalisti e revanscisti tedeschi. È contro queste figure, vedi da noi Aldo Moro, che si accanisce sempre la barbarie più fanatica. Risultano, alla fine, queste le personalità più pericolose. La violenza politica è propria dei deboli, non dei forti. Chi non riesce a combattere il proprio avversario con le armi della critica, ricorre alla critica delle armi. È questo che hanno fatto i grandi totalitarismi e questo hanno fatto i piccoli terrorismi. Nel giugno del 1985, nel centenario della nascita e nel 61° anniversario della morte di Matteotti - prendo questa citazione da una documentatissima monografia su Giuseppe Saragat, ad opera del nostro collega senatore Fornaro - Saragat, chiamato a tenere la commemorazione ufficiale alla presenza del presidente della Repubblica Sandro Pertini, fa un\\'interessante notazione: « Il riformismo di Matteotti è un atteggiamento di serietà di fronte a problemi che non si risolvono con i conati del dilettantismo pseudorivoluzionario o con la violenza dei fanatici, ma con un\\'azione consapevole e creativa». Matteotti, nella sua breve intensa esistenza, si è a fondo cimentato con quel \"riformismo alla prova\", che è il titolo di un articolo di Filippo Turati su «Critica sociale», non a caso nel momento in cui si apriva il lungo Ministero Giolitti. Giacomo Matteotti è un vaccino contro la possibile malattia del riformismo. Arfè concludeva il suo saggio ricordando l\\'intuizione, che subito si diffuse allora, che egli fosse andato volontariamente incontro alla morte o che comunque l\\'abbia attesa, senza cercarla, ma senza indietreggiare di un passo. E ricorda che Claudio Treves fu il primo a salutarlo martire, che Piero Gobetti lo ha definito «Il volontario della morte», che Ernesto Bonaiuti lo interpella: «Vai tu in cerca del volto di Dio?», che Carlo Rosselli scriverà a Nenni: «Tu mi parlasti una volta e in modo che mi commosse, di Matteotti. Anch\\'io ho spesso sognato di poter finire così utilmente la mia vita». E sappiamo che ci riuscirà. Concludeva il saggio: «Sono testimonianze di uomini, tra le coscienze più alte dell\\'Italia del tempo». E, verrebbe amaramente da dire, di un tempo. Cara signora Presidente, senatrici e senatori, noi abbiamo il dovere, l\\'obbligazione etica di trasmettere alle nuove generazioni l\\'esempio di queste persone, che hanno reso nobile la vocazione alla politica. Non basta il tribunale giudiziario, è davanti al tribunale di questa storia che sono e devono essere convocati, perché arrivino a vergognarsi di se stessi, se ne sono ancora capaci, tutti i corrotti e i corruttori che infestano, con la loro peste, la nostra Repubblica.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5962406396865845, 0.40375933051109314]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, illustri colleghi, oggi non ci accingiamo solamente a decidere del futuro di un intero territorio, ma stiamo per scrivere una nuova pagina della storia istituzionale italiana. Con l'approvazione delle modifiche allo Statuto della Regione autonoma Friuli-Venezia Giulia stiamo operando un cambiamento epocale all'interno dell'assetto istituzionale italiano. Il processo di riforma che sta ora investendo la mia Regione potrebbe, fra pochissimo tempo, manifestarsi anche nel resto del Paese, pertanto asserisco senza difficoltà alcuna che, in questo storico momento, il Friuli-Venezia Giulia è un precursore dei tempi. Con la rimozione delle Province dallo Statuto, la Regione si sta ponendo all'avanguardia nel riassetto istituzionale italiano, soprattutto se si considera che, con la definitiva realizzazione della riforma del Titolo V della Costituzione, le Province non saranno più previste anche nel resto del Paese. <p> Bisogna premettere che in Friuli-Venezia Giulia si è già iniziato a superare le Province, con una riforma degli enti locali che rispetta i principi costituzionali di sussidiarietà, adeguatezza ed efficienza. Si tratta di una riforma che porterà ad una nuova organizzazione dell'assetto istituzionale regionale e al miglioramento dei servizi erogati ai cittadini. Si tratta quindi di un processo complesso, che porterà ad un sistema integrato basato su due pilastri: la Regione e i Comuni. Le Unioni territoriali intercomunali, che nascono da questa riforma, sono delle emanazioni dirette dei Comuni - ciò va sottolineato in particolar modo - che sono in procinto di effettuare una complessiva riallocazione delle funzioni amministrative nella Regione. Queste Unioni eserciteranno in forma associata funzioni comunali e di area vasta, sia provinciali che regionali, dando quindi vita ad una nuova forma di governo del territorio, in grado di lavorare in maniera più efficiente a favore del cittadino. I Comuni saranno così tenuti ad operare insieme, generando tutta una serie di processi positivi, fra i quali lo scambio di buone pratiche e la specializzazione dei servizi. <p> Quello che la Regione Friuli-Venezia Giulia ha fatto con il rimodellamento della propria architettura istituzionale e la conseguente razionalizzazione delle autonomie locali è di fatto una delle massime espressioni di utilizzo della propria specialità. Il Friuli-Venezia Giulia sta quindi dimostrando un'autonomia seria, determinata e coerente, esercitando le proprie competenze per portare ad un efficientamento dei servizi e ad una migliore gestione del denaro pubblico. Il Friuli-Venezia Giulia è dunque un'avanguardia importante di un cambiamento capace di migliorare la qualità della vita della popolazione ivi residente. Il testo che andremo a votare prevede anche la possibilità di istituire, come è stato detto, Città metropolitane nel territorio del Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Va ricordato che questo intervento modificativo è stato molto dibattuto e anche criticato dalle forze politiche nel Consiglio della succitata Regione e io stessa lo trovo alquanto forzato, anche perché la Regione ha già iniziato un processo di profondo cambiamento che porterà i Comuni a lavorare insieme. La Città metropolitana rischierebbe dunque di sovrapporsi alle già costituite Unioni territoriali intercomunali. Va però ribadito che non è previsto alcun obbligo di istituzione della Città metropolitana e che in forza della potestà legislativa in materia di ordinamento degli enti locali, la disciplina in materia è demandata alla Regione. <p> Bene, quindi, ma non possiamo concederci il lusso di perdere ulteriore tempo.

Signor Presidente, ringrazio il Governo, nella persona del Sottosegretario, e mi ritengo parzialmente soddisfatto (spiegherò anche il perché). La risposta del Governo certifica un dato di fatto, ossia che abbiamo la certezza di un inquinamento di quest'area che risale al 2009, se non prima. Sono parzialmente soddisfatto, perché nella conclusione della sua risposta il Ministero assicura un alto livello di attenzione. Questo è quello che in realtà a noi serve; questo è ciò che noi volevamo avere come risposta alla nostra interrogazione, perché sottolineo con grande amarezza che questa è una storia che va avanti da tanti anni. Tante sono state le sollecitazioni, tante sono state le iniziative delle comunità e delle istituzioni; tante sono state le segnalazioni delle stesse aziende che orbitano in quell'area. La percezione - che non è solo una percezione, ma una certezza - è che la Basilicata sia quasi una pattumiera; e non sono solo questi i casi di inquinamento ambientale, come ben sappiamo. Nessuna risposta in questi anni è arrivata dagli enti preposti e dalla Regione Basilicata. Per quale motivo? Forse perché con questo rimbalzo di competenze si è voluto coprire una serie di mancanze? Forse perché la Regione Basilicata, non avendo più discariche a disposizione, non sapeva dove portare i rifiuti? Per concludere, ciò che chiedo al Governo è di mantenere l'impegno che ha assunto verso la conclusione della sua risposta, perché evidentemente non possiamo più fidarci e non possiamo più ritenere assolutamente attendibili, né credibili, i controlli, gli atti e le iniziative degli enti preposti localmente e di una Regione Basilicata che da anni è stata governata in modo irresponsabile dal centrosinistra. Tante sono state le iniziative a cui non è stata data risposta. Soltanto ultimamente, grazie all'intervento della magistratura e del NOE, è stata data una risposta. Ritengo che questo comportamento sia da irresponsabili; è un atteggiamento, non solo delle istituzioni, assolutamente punibile da un punto di vista morale e politico. Di conseguenza, se è vero che la responsabilità non è di questo Governo, appena subentrato al precedente, è però sua responsabilità tutelare una comunità, come quella lucana e del Vulture Melfese, che non può continuare a essere trattata in questo modo.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5968320965766907, 0.4031679928302765]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> MOSCARDELLI (<PARTY>). Con questo intervento di fine seduta continuo, oggi, al Senato, una staffetta con cui, assieme a tante senatrici e tanti senatori, ricordiamo ogni donna che viene uccisa per mano di un uomo a cui è o è stata legata da relazione amorosa. E, fino a che sarà necessario, ricorderemo al Parlamento e al nostro Paese l'urgenza di arginare la violenza nei confronti delle donne. Sono ben cinque i femminicidi di cui oggi ci dobbiamo occupare. Due episodi simili hanno avuto luogo la scorsa settimana. Il 9 marzo, a Gambellara, in provincia di Vicenza, Vanna Meggiolaro, di cinquant'anni, è stata uccisa dal marito, che aveva denunciato per maltrattamenti e dal quale si stava separando. Come aveva più volte minacciato di fare, il marito, con lei a bordo, si è scagliato contro un TIR uccidendola e rimanendo a sua volta ucciso. Con la stessa modalità, pochi giorni dopo, il 12 marzo, a Pordenone, Jamir Temjenlelmla, trentasette anni, è stata uccisa dall'ex compagno, anch'esso morto nello scontro da lui provocato con un TIR, che ha causato, questa volta, anche la morte del conducente dell'automezzo. Anche in questo caso l'episodio avviene dopo una serie di minacce e maltrattamenti per i quali la donna lo aveva denunciato. Nella notte fra il 17 e il 18 marzo a Orte, in provincia di Viterbo, Silvia Tabacchi, una donna di ventotto anni, è stata uccisa a colpi di pistola dall'ex fidanzato, da cui si era separata da poco, che poi si è ucciso. Il 10 marzo è stato arrestato il marito di Xiang Lei Li, trentasei anni, con l'accusa di avere ucciso la propria moglie, a Genova, durante una crociera. Il marito della donna si accingeva a rientrare a casa, in Irlanda, con i due figli di cinque e sette anni. Di particolare efferatezza è stata poi l'uccisione, l'8 marzo, a Cirò Marina, in provincia di Crotone, di Antonella Lettieri, di quarantadue anni, che è stata ferocemente assassinata con 12 coltellate e altrettante martellate da un uomo che conosceva e che rientrava nella sua rete di relazioni più strette. Salgono così a 45 le donne che ricordiamo in questa staffetta, iniziata solo il 30 giugno 2016. Riproponiamo con convinzione il nostro appello; un appello al Governo tutto e alla Sottosegretaria con delega alle pari opportunità: la cabina di regia monitori l'applicazione, i pregi e i limiti della legge n. 119 del 2013 e dia piena e accurata attuazione al piano contro la violenza. Occorre intervenire nell'ambiente di formazione e di educazione di ciascuna persona; la scuola e la famiglia sono le comunità educanti che accompagnano la crescita di ciascuno. Solo attraverso una formazione puntuale e continua sul tema possiamo pensare di sconfiggere questa barbarie. Un appello al Paese, a tutti gli uomini e a tutte le donne: sono già state più di 120 le donne uccise nel 2016 e non possiamo accettare più questa mattanza.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5446543097496033, 0.4553457498550415]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, il disegno di legge che oggi voteremo è particolarmente significativo in primo luogo perché risponde ai bisogni dei ragazzi. Secondo i dati fornitici da Save the children infatti, i due terzi dei nostri ragazzi ritengono che il cyberbullismo sia la principale minaccia nella loro vita. <p> Un provvedimento importante dunque, per il quale ringrazio la senatrice Ferrara, non solo per il tema che affronta, ma anche per come lo affronta. <p> Vorrei sottolineare due aspetti. Innanzitutto, che il provvedimento si fonda sulla prevenzione mettendo al centro la formazione del personale scolastico, di tutto il personale scolastico. Questo fa una grande differenza perché sul cyberbullismo nelle scuole si è intervenuti già ma si è sempre trattato di progetti che sono nati e poi morti. Fondare la prevenzione sulla formazione del personale vuol dire scegliere una modalità efficace e duratura perché formare gli insegnanti in stretta collaborazione con le famiglie e le istituzioni locali significa che l'educazione consapevole alla rete sarà un'attività permanente, diventerà una sorta di DNA dell'educazione scolastica. <p> Inoltre, con riguardo al metodo, la definizione di un piano di azione integrato, anche attraverso la costituzione a livello nazionale di un tavolo tecnico composto da vari Ministeri e proiettato (così come si legge nelle linee guida del Ministero della pubblica istruzione) a livello locale rappresenta una scelta assolutamente importante. <p> Ribadisco l'importanza del provvedimento in questa sede anche in risposta alle troppe, ingenerose critiche che si leggono sui mezzi di stampa, ma soprattutto sul web che hanno sottolineato la inutilità del disegno di legge dichiarandola, talvolta, anche inopportuna. Chi ha sostenuto e ancora oggi sostiene questa tesi ha fondato tale giudizio sull'idea che le uniche cose che servano contro il cyberbullismo sarebbero le iniziative di autoregolamentazione che, tra l'altro, sono anche in corsa a livello europeo e internazionale ed alle quali hanno già aderito la maggior parte dei gestori delle grandi piattaforme di social network: da Google a Facebook, passando da Microsoft ed Apple. Sostengono, insomma, queste persone che essenziale, dirimente e sufficiente è l'impegno dei gestori attraverso l'adozione di meccanismi di segnalazione e controllo. E come non essere d'accordo con il riconoscimento di questo percorso di responsabilizzazione dei social network ? È importante e sicuramente dovrà ulteriormente progredire, ma con altrettanta chiarezza dico che ciò non basta, non è sufficiente. È necessaria una legge, questo disegno di legge assolutamente non basato su atteggiamenti sanzionatori perché è un provvedimento che non criminalizza il web: è un disegno di legge basato sulla prevenzione, sulla promozione culturale dell'uso consapevole della rete. È un disegno di legge che nella promozione dell'uso corretto della rete ha qualcosa di fondamentale, perché mette al centro la responsabilità individuale e collettiva. Non è un provvedimento fondato su proposte coercitive e punitive, ma sulla promozione di una cultura civica basata sul rispetto per sé e per gli altri. Rispetto per sé e per gli altri: sono queste le parole che vestono gli abiti della prevenzione e dell'educazione, perché senza queste parole educazione e prevenzione sarebbero parole vuote. Questa è la sfida importante. L'educazione all'uso consapevole della rete non è, non sarà e non dovrà essere solo e soltanto la messa in atto di una conoscenza, di una tecnica per difendersi o per difendere i minori, ma deve esplicare un'azione altrettanto importante. Ovviamente, è necessario conoscere anche le tecniche, ma altrettanto importante è l'attivazione di un processo educativo di cittadinanza, far crescere quella consapevolezza dell'esistenza inscindibile di diritti e responsabilità, della inscindibilità del rispetto che ognuno pretende per se stesso e che deve corrispondere al rispetto per gli altri. Dovrà essere, e sarà, un percorso che aiuterà e sosterrà la costruzione di identità individuali e collettive più forti e meno fragili, aiutando i ragazzi ad essere capaci di rispetto per coloro che, invece, oggi vengono troppo spesso vissuti come diversi. La gran parte degli episodi di bullismo e di cyberbullismo sono rivolti verso giovani omosessuali, disabili ed immigrati. E qui non aggiungo altro, perché condivido pienamente l'intervento del senatore Lo Giudice. Ho parlato di rispetto di sé e degli altri, ma perché l'ho fatto? L'ho fatto perché non dobbiamo dimenticare che due sono i soggetti danneggiati dal cyberbullismo. Sicuramente, in primo luogo e in modo drammatico, chi lo subisce. Persone che in poco tempo vedono la propria reputazione e la propria immagine danneggiata, e in una comunità molto ampia. I contenuti, infatti, una volta pubblicati, ancora oggi possono riapparire, a più riprese e in luoghi diversi (ricordo che due terzi dei ragazzi ritengono il cyberbullismo la principale minaccia alla propria vita), e tutto ciò rende le vittime insicure in tutti gli ambiti e i momenti della propria vita. Ma io ritengo vittima del cyberbullismo anche chi lo compie, perché violenti, cattivi e bulli non si nasce. La spiegazione è che quello che si è incontrato, o non si è incontrato, nella propria vita, ci ha resi in qualche modo fragili rispetto al rischio di attivare comportamenti così violenti. Se a dodici, tredici, quattordici o quindici anni si compiono quegli atti terribili, dovremmo innanzitutto chiederci perché ciò succede. Se, infatti, è vero che l'anonimato della Rete spinge a compiere gesti che sarebbe difficile compiere in altri luoghi ed altri spazi della vita, è anche vero che sempre di più, nei video pubblicati, sono ben visibili, non solo i soggetti maltrattati, ma anche gli autori, che esibiscono, quasi come una prova muscolare, la loro rabbia, la loro aggressività, il loro proprio disprezzo verso coloro che sono maltrattati e rappresentati come deboli e diversi. C'è quindi qualcosa che va oltre, e sulla quale dovremmo ragionare. Anche per questo sottolineo l'importanza che la proposta di legge metta al centro l'ambito della scuola. Anche ricerche europee, infatti, confermano che è la scuola l'ambito nel quale scatta oltre il 90 per cento degli episodi di bullismo. Nel mentre sottolineo l'importanza della scuola, però, dico anche che noi abbiamo il dovere di non delegare tale questione ai soli ragazzi, alle sole scuole e alla sole famiglie che, peraltro, vanno aiutate ad agire insieme. Tale questione, infatti, chiama in campo in primo luogo, come hanno detto molti altri colleghi, noi adulti. Siamo noi adulti, non soltanto come genitori ma il mondo degli adulti in generale, ad essere responsabili. Tutti noi cresciamo e costruiamo la nostra identità, non in base alle parole che ci vengono dette o i «pistolotti» che si ricevono in famiglia, ma per gli esempi e per le situazioni, quelle che viviamo in casa ma soprattutto quelle che vediamo fuori. Bisogna ragionare sulla nostra responsabilità e su quali sono, individualmente e collettivamente, gli esempi che viviamo nella nostra quotidianità. E mi viene in mente l'episodio di questi giorni, riguardo alle persone uccise perché incapaci di vivere in quel clima difficile di relazione che vi è all'interno dei condomini. Ma che immagine diamo rispetto alla capacità di tessere relazioni basate sul rispetto per se stessi e per gli altri? A me preoccupa profondamente il cyberbullismo, ma preoccupa anche il comportamento degli adulti. Per fare degli esempi, io penso a quel gruppo di genitori che si sono tutti ribellati al preside che ha sospeso per quattro giorni gli studenti di una classe che avevano usato una violenza davvero terribile nei confronti di un compagno di classe durante una gita scolastica, nel corso di una di quelle nottate in cui ci si ubriaca, postando poi sul web il filmato di tale violenza. Quei genitori, una volta che sono stati chiamati dal preside e sono venuti a conoscenza del fatto che il proprio figlio avesse compiuto quegli atti, si sono arrabbiati con il preside e hanno detto che in fondo era una ragazzata ed erano preoccupati non del fatto che i propri figli fossero capaci di questa violenza ma unicamente del fatto che la sospensione potesse danneggiare l'esito dell'anno scolastico. Dico questo anche facendo riferimentoad un sondaggio sviluppato nel 2004 all'interno della rete europea dell'antibullismo che ha riguardato, da un parte, i ragazzi che hanno subito cyberbullismo e, dall'altro, un gruppo di 2.000 adulti. Dal sondaggio emerge che, dei ragazzi che hanno subito atti cyberbullismo, il 35 per cento ha compiuto atti di autolesionismo, il 55 è caduto in depressione e il 38 per cento ha pensato al suicidio. Qui non posso non ricordare le vittime, coloro che si sono tolte la vita, e il dolore insuperabile delle famiglie. Dall'altro canto, sul versante degli adulti intervistati, a fronte di questa fatica che i ragazzi vivono avendo subito il cyberbullismo, sapete cosa viene fuori? Il 34 per cento ha pensato che in fondo gli atti di cyberbullismo sono una normale fase della crescita, mentre il 16 per cento considera il cyberbullismo come qualcosa che forma il carattere: insomma, il 50 per cento degli adulti intervistati non ha la giusta percezione della violenza che subisce chi è oggetto di cyberbullismo e neanche della violenza e del disagio che i propri figli e i ragazzi hanno. Occorre riconnettere con la realtà il mondo degli adulti. Anche per questo è essenziale che sia nel disegno di legge che nelle linee guida della pubblica istruzione, che ricordo ha già finanziato con 2 milioni di euro interventi di formazione nella scuola, si indichino come soggetti importanti da coinvolgere anche le famiglie e tutte le istituzioni che hanno competenza nell'educazione e nell'accompagnamento alla crescita. L'educazione corretta alla Rete aiuta a superare il cyberbullismo, ma c'è un'altra cosa importante: la percezione del pericolo insito nell'uso scorretto della Rete. Dico questo perché è importante che la tutela dei minori sia considerata e percepita e agita come una responsabilità collettiva che deve essere condivisa dai genitori, dalle istituzioni e dagli operatori e la lotta al cyberbullismo non può prescindere dalle sinergie di queste forze e dall'uso consapevole del web da parte di tutti. Quel tavolo ministeriale e territoriale dovranno essere inclusivi e la formazione e la coformazione di tutti i soggetti istituzionali e professionali che ne faranno parte è essenziale. Non la formazione disgiunta, ma la coformazione perché solo così si costruisce non solo un argine al dilagare del fenomeno, ma anche una nuova comune consapevolezza che aiuterà anche ad evitare altre pesanti conseguenze a chi usa non correttamente o in modo inconsapevole il web. Noi sappiamo che un minore su tre fa nuove conoscenze in rete, che poi vengono concretizzate da rapporti reali. Sottolineo un dato venuto fuori dall'indagine conoscitiva della Commissione bicamerale sull'infanzia sulla prostituzione minorile. I dati non li cito a caso, ma perché sono stati drammaticamente denunciati nell'apertura dell'anno giudiziario. Nelle grandi aree urbane dall'anno scorso la prostituzione minorile è aumentata del 400 per cento. Di questo 400 per cento, una percentuale altissima (quasi il 60 per cento) è fatta attraverso l'adescamento in rete. Quindi, un uso consapevole e corretto della rete vuol dire non solo aiutare a superare il cyberbullismo, ma anche evitare gli altri danni terribili che attraverso un uso scorretto della rete aumentano la pedopornografia e i casi di prostituzione attraverso l'adescamento in rete. Auspico che il disegno di legge che abbiamo approvato in Commissione affari istituzionali all'unanimità esca all'unanimità da quest'Aula e sia altrettanto rapidamente approvato alla Camera, affinché, insieme alle linee guida del Ministero, già finanziate con risorse non sufficienti, ma importanti (due milioni di euro), possa davvero rapidamente attivare non solo un percorso informativo ma anche quel percorso formativo rispetto al fondamentale rispetto per sé e per gli altri. È un percorso di promozione di vera cittadinanza, ma anche di promozione dell'elemento fondamentale della questione sociale, ovvero del benessere individuale e collettivo. <p> Rinvio il seguito della discussione dei disegni di legge in titolo ad altra seduta.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5894996523857117, 0.41050031781196594]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, il disegno di legge che è oggi al nostro esame riguarda la ratifica ed esecuzione dell'Accordo tra il Governo della Repubblica italiana e il Governo della Repubblica francese per la realizzazione e l'esercizio di una nuova linea ferroviaria Torino-Lione, sottoscritto a Roma il 30 gennaio 2012. Il testo, già approvato dalla Camera dei deputati, è composto da cinque articoli necessari a ratificare l'Accordo in parola. L'Accordo definisce il quadro generale per la realizzazione del progetto di collegamento ferroviario tra Torino e Lione, nonché la conseguente gestione della sezione transfrontaliera italo-francese. <p> Mi preme precisare che l'Accordo non consente di per sé l'avvio delle opere di realizzazione del collegamento; sarà infatti necessario un ulteriore Protocollo addizionale tra Italia e Francia. Non comprendo quindi l'ostracismo del <PARTY> e di SEL, né la presentazione di complessivi 1.116 tra emendamenti e ordini del giorno; un ostruzionismo cieco ed improduttivo. <p> È certamente vero che l'opera è criticata anche da una parte delle popolazioni interessate, ma con molti di loro, in particolare con quelli che rifiutano manifestazioni di tipo violento, si è costantemente tenuto aperto il colloquio e si sono raggiunti accordi che ci convincono a sostenere l' iter di questo provvedimento. Il progetto definitivo si differenzia in modo sostanziale da quello originario, essendo state accettate molte delle osservazioni avanzate dalle popolazioni locali e dai loro rappresentanti a livello istituzionale. Dall'Accordo non derivano nuovi o maggiori oneri a carico della finanza pubblica. Gli oneri vi saranno solo al momento della firma del Protocollo e saranno previsti nel disegno di legge di ratifica del Protocollo stesso. Va rilevato che la linea alta velocità Torino-Lione si inserisce nel Corridoio 5 Lisbona-Kiev, uno tra i dieci collegamenti più importanti dell'Unione europea per volume di trasporti, sia di passeggeri che di merci. Sottolineo che l'opera può garantire all'Italia notevoli benefici dal punto di vista economico e occupazionale, e consente una forte riduzione dell'inquinamento legato al trasporto su gomma. I dati tecnici ci fanno comprendere che si tratta di un'infrastruttura importante per il nostro Paese: 33 chilometri in Francia, 57 chilometri di tunnel, 3 chilometri aperti a Susa e 19,5 chilometri tra Susa e Chiusa S. Michele. Il costo complessivo è di circa 23 miliardi, dei quali metà a carico dell'Italia. Il traffico potenziale nel 2035, anno in cui è prevista l'inaugurazione, sarà pari a 25,5 milioni di tonnellate; questo traffico alleggerirà anche il traforo del Frejus, che altrimenti arriverebbe a 39,9 milioni di tonnellate all'anno contro gli attuali 15,5. Ed ancora, 17 milioni di passeggeri via auto e 4,5 milioni di passeggeri via ferrovia fanno comprendere la strategicità dell'opera. I benefici sono evidenti, considerato che si prevede che nei cantieri saranno occupate 1.850 persone dirette annue e 5.800 saranno occupate nell'indotto. L'occupazione a regime sarà di 280 addetti annui e 140 nell'indotto. La Francia ha già ratificato l'Accordo e le contrarietà sono certamente una piccola minoranza, avendo capito anche la parte francese quale sia l'interesse strategico l'interesse strategico della infrastruttura.

La misura che proponiamo non comporta affatto un esborso di risorse aggiuntive da parte dello Stato, né comporta minore introito da parte dello Stato. Non si tratta di una misura assistenziale e non si tratta di una misura di aiuto. Chiediamo che lo Stato italiano e la stessa Unione europea, visto che la Svizzera è extracomunitaria, calcoli adeguatamente, direi in maniera sicura, quali possono essere i risultati conseguenti all'adozione della misura che proponiamo. Cito anch'io l'antecedente che ha già ricordato il collega senatore Candiani e che negoziai allora con lo Stato, negli anni 2000 e 2001, nella mia veste di Presidente della Regione Lombardia. A dire il vero impiegammo diversi mesi per convincere lo Stato ad adottare la misura dell'abbassamento delle accise per i carburanti venduti nelle fasce di confine (ovvero nella fascia dei 20 e dei 30 chilometri). Quando finalmente lo Stato si convinse e accettò, le entrate dello Stato aumentarono considerevolmente, in seguito all'aumentata vendita di carburanti scontati rispetto al tempo precedente, ma che i consumatori italiani residenti in quelle zone di confine preferivano acquistare in Italia, invece di recarsi ad acquistarli nella vicina Confederazione elvetica. Da allora, dal 2001 a tutto l'anno 2013, lo Stato italiano ha incassato di più: si parla di maggiori incassi per lo Stato italiano per decine di milioni di euro a seguito di quel regime fiscale favorevole, che ha permesso ai consumatori italiani residenti in quelle zona di confine di spendere di meno. Ha permesso a quelle zone di non essere desertificate dal punto di vista della presenza di distributori di carburante; ha permesso quindi a diverse famiglie che praticavano quel commercio di continuare a vivere. È la tipica soluzione win-win, dove vincono tutti e dove a perderci semmai sono i cittadini elvetici; ma i cittadini elvetici non rientrano sotto la nostra giurisdizione e quindi non sta a noi suggerire loro misure. Hanno un'abilità sufficiente e hanno guerreggiato con noi in maniera diversificata per cercare di riprendersi quegli introiti. Costantemente dobbiamo aggiornare le tariffe; è una simpatica guerra commerciale, che però finora ha visto vincitori sia i consumatori lombardi, sia lo Stato italiano, sia la stessa Unione europea.

Si dice che non c'è domanda sufficiente. Ma non si dice, signori senatori, che la domanda può essere sostenuta da un'adeguata offerta infrastrutturale e che la sostenibilità economica potrà trovare adeguato soddisfacimento, implementando inevitabilmente i grandi flussi turistici che dal Nord dell'Europa potranno riversarsi nel Mezzogiorno, nell'ambito di un auspicabile sforzo di ammodernamento del Paese che passi attraverso l'impiego di nuove tecnologie della comunicazione, la formazione del capitale umano, la dotazione infrastrutturale e la intermodalità dei mezzi di trasporto. I musei, le pinacoteche, i fascinosi centri storici, le rovine archeologiche e gli straordinari litorali del Sud possono quindi rappresentare l'offerta e stimolare la domanda. Anche l'occupazione se ne avvantaggerà e i giovani, con le loro lauree e i loro diplomi, potranno trovare impiego, anche l'autoimpiego, perché a questo corale sforzo sociale potranno partecipare le migliori energie del Sud, i più bei talenti d'Italia. Aderendo a questa mozione e a quella successiva mettiamo il Sud nella condizione di non stare a contemplare il proprio ombelico, come una nobiltà decaduta che vede allungarsi le ombre dei magnogreci, dei bizantini e dei normanno-svevi. Diamo quindi dignità a questo passato remoto riscattando il passato recente e soprattutto il nostro presente, l'inverno del nostro scontento. Signori senatori, non abbiamo osato, forse non abbiamo voluto osare, nel pensare in grande. L'invito quindi è ad implementare ogni azione volta al soddisfacimento della domanda di partecipazione: coinvolgiamo le scuole, il sistema dell'istruzione, il mondo dell'imprenditoria e quello delle professioni. Alla politica si chiede, in questo processo, di dare corpo e sostanza alla domanda di partecipazione, favorendo nel Paese il dibattito sociale, con il coinvolgimento degli stakeholder e del mondo dell'informazione. A tale proposito, signor Presidente, devo lodare la pregevole iniziativa assunta dal maggiore, per vetustà e per readership, quotidiano regionale, la «Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno», che prima ha intervistato i presidenti e gli amministratori delle Regioni rivierasche adriatiche, dal Friuli Venezia Giulia alla Puglia, e poi li ha riuniti in uno straordinario workshop svoltosi recentemente a Bari. L'alta velocità, l'alta capacità, come pure il ponte sullo Stretto prima si realizzano e meglio sarà, per noi, per i nostri figli e per il futuro delle nostre generazioni.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5480937957763672, 0.4519062340259552]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> MUCCHETTI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, intervengo sull'ordine dei lavori. Ieri non abbiamo scritto una bella pagina nella storia del Senato. La responsabilità di questa pagina sarà materia di riflessione e magari anche un po' di indagine sul perché e il percome un tentativo di mediazione, quello tentato dal senatore Chiti per ristabilire un clima di collaborazione costituzionale, pur nella distinzione dei ruoli e delle opinioni, non sia andato in porto. Adesso, signor Presidente, molto del peso della necessità che il dibattito in Aula proceda in modo positivo e concludente riposa sulle sue spalle. Io la ricordo in campagna elettorale, quando tutti e due eravamo stati chiamati dal <PARTY>, pur non avendo tessere, a portare un contributo al Paese che veniva dalle nostre rispettive e diverse esperienze professionali, come una persona saggia, equilibrata e ferma. Non ho condiviso ieri gli attacchi che sono stati portati alla sua persona. Tuttavia, a un suo vecchio compagno di campagna elettorale sarà consentito di chiederle un chiarimento circa l'uso, l'origine, il come e il perché si sia usato - e si sia usato in quel modo - il meccanismo del canguro, la cui esistenza come tanti, non essendo un esperto del ramo... <p> Chiederei agli amici del <PARTY> di dare prova di essere rispettosi di un loro compagno di partito mentre sta parlando. <p> Mi rivolgo al Presidente per dire che nei giorni scorsi mi è capitato di leggere un'intervista di un costituzionalista di rango, Augusto Barbera, che ebbe anche responsabilità politiche di primo piano. In questa intervista Barbera sembra quasi suggerirle (anzi, le suggerisce apertamente) l'adozione di questo meccanismo e fa riferimento alla precedente esperienza, ormai di tanti anni fa, della presidente della Camera Nilde Iotti, persona indimenticabile per tutti noi, che usò quel meccanismo per domare l'ostruzionismo che allora veniva - così racconta Barbera - dai radicali e dalle file dello stesso Partito Comunista (di cui molti eredi sono qui presenti nel Gruppo del <PARTY>), lo stesso Gruppo che aveva indicato Nilde Iotti alla Presidenza della Camera. Ho letto con commozione questa memoria di Barbera perché, al di là del tecnicismo, ci ricorda come uno dei più grandi Presidenti di una Camera parlamentare - Nilde Iotti, appunto - sapesse, in momenti cruciali, distinguersi dal suo stesso campo di origine e di appartenenza. <p> Io so che lei ‑ e lo ha dimostrato in più di un'occasione - sa essere il Presidente di tutti, non il Presidente del partito per il quale ha partecipato alla campagna elettorale e dal quale è stato portato in quest'Aula. <p> Le chiedo, allora, se ha cinque minuti di pazienza, di spiegare ancora una volta, al fine di consentire a tutti noi una più matura riflessione su come stanno andando le cose e su come si sviluppa il dibattito in quest'Aula, il rapporto con la tradizione alta del parlamentarismo italiano e, in particolare, con la natura del meccanismo del canguro, che nel Regolamento e nella prassi del Senato non c'è, ma che c'è in quello della Camera, con l'eccezione dichiarata in statuto delle leggi costituzionali, questione che ieri qualche collega ha sollevato. <p> Io non ho pregiudizi di alcun genere, si può anche innovare, ma un'innovazione di tale portata - che io capisco così, ma forse mi sbaglio, e chiederei di essere illuminato - merita un supplemento di spiegazioni, perché forse in questo modo il clima di quest'Aula potrà migliorare.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5079603791236877, 0.49203959107398987]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, signora rappresentante per Governo, onorevoli colleghi, il decreto-legge oggetto di conversione ha il merito di garantire la continuità della presenza dello Stato nelle zone dell'Emilia-Romagna segnate da tre eventi tragici e calamitosi che hanno colpito le famiglie, le comunità e le imprese di quei territori. <p> Non si può quindi non condividere la ratio del decreto in questione. Anche per una forza politica collocata all'opposizione come la nostra, i motivi e le finalità del provvedimento sono da accogliere e sostenere, senza cedere alla facile ed ipocrita tentazione della strumentalizzazione ad esclusivo uso demagogico. Peraltro, voglio evidenziare che già nel passaggio alla Camera il Gruppo di Forza Italia si è seriamente impegnato per migliorare ed ulteriormente arricchire il decreto. Il testo dello stesso, come abbiamo sentito, è diviso in due parti: due articoli che si occupano rispettivamente degli interventi urgenti del Commissario per la ricostruzione della Regione Emilia-Romagna e dell'integrazione del Fondo per le emergenze nazionali. L'articolo 1 ha certamente il merito di migliorare e completare le attività di ricostruzione. Per conseguire tale obiettivo si specifica nel dettaglio la ripartizione delle risorse finanziarie destinate ai privati, alle attività economiche e alle opere di messa in sicurezza idraulica. Molto condivisibili sono le misure individuate per concedere benefici alle imprese agricole colpite dagli eventi calamitosi. Queste misure sono introdotte dal comma 5- bis dell'articolo 1, che rimanda al decreto legislativo n. 102 del 2004. Hanno il pregio della semplificazione, peraltro, i commi 6, 7 e 8, che disciplinano i poteri demandati al Commissario e le modalità per la concessione dei contributi. Sono certamente condivisibili tutte le disposizioni relative alla gestione delle operazioni di mutuo a carico di soggetti proprietari di edifici distrutti o inagibili: si tratta di diversi commi, che si occupano di esigenze diverse, che comunque devono essere tutte prese in considerazione. Queste riflessioni, insieme a quelle riguardanti l'uso del credito d'imposta, alle misure relative alla cassa integrazione guadagni e alla proroga dei termini del decreto-legge n. 74 del 2012 per gli immobili adibiti ad abitazione principale - per consentire dunque anche la sanatoria della registrazione, con un irrisorio versamento del 2 per cento - sono la parte positiva e più condivisibile del decreto-legge. Con l'articolo 2 si affronta il problema dell'operatività del Fondo per le emergenze nazionali, e a tale proposito devo esprimere un commento negativo, perché gli esiti sono poco soddisfacenti, visti gli esigui stanziamenti dello stesso. In particolare, va evidenziato che il presente testo normativo sfugge completamente al tema della prevenzione del dissesto idrogeologico. È il caso di sottolineare che negli ultimi anni i due rami del Parlamento hanno più volte posto tale questione con mozioni, disegni di legge e altre iniziative parlamentari; eppure, anche in questa occasione il Governo ha glissato sull'argomento, limitandosi ad affrontare solo il tema delle emergenze. Capisco che c'era un problema di competenze e di materie che non dovevano essere sovrapposte, ma, come abbiamo sentito dall'intervento del senatore Uras, il problema si ripropone e ci sono leggi che aspettano delle risposte in questo senso; inoltre, tutto ciò va a discapito delle esigenze della prevenzione. È quindi questa la sede più opportuna per ricordare a noi stessi e al Governo che l'obiettivo della prevenzione del rischio idrogeologico deve essere prioritario, per rammentare che non vi vive di sola Expo o di solo MOSE, per sottolineare che negli ultimi due anni non è stata ancora attuata alcuna concreta iniziativa da parte dell'Esecutivo: siamo ancora agli slogan e registriamo le puntuali tragiche recriminazioni del giorno dopo senza poter fare niente. Tornando al decreto-legge in esame, va ancora evidenziata l'incongruenza del Governo rispetto al ruolo assegnato alle Province di Modena e Bologna. Lo stesso Governo che svuota le Province (anzi, che con la riforma costituzionale le abolisce), si rende poi conto della loro funzione, della loro insostituibilità, e cerca di coinvolgerle nella gestione delle emergenze. In questo caso, il commento sarebbe un'ironia amara che si potrebbe utilizzare per far notare l'incongruenza e la contraddizione delle politiche del Governo. Prima di concludere mi si concedano altre due riflessioni. La prima riguarda l'invito al Governo a porsi il problema delle recenti calamità naturali che hanno colpito diverse zone della Puglia, con danni ingenti per le imprese agricole di quel territorio. Nei prossimi giorni mi aspetto delle risposte eloquenti e puntuali anche con l'utilizzazione del Fondo nazionale, così come reintegrato all'articolo 2; tuttavia, se è vero quello che succede per la Sardegna (e mi rifaccio di nuovo alle parole del senatore Uras), non ho grandi speranze da questo punto di vista. La seconda riflessione, signor Presidente, è di tipo più politico, ed attiene alla gestione delle emergenze nel nostro Paese. Negli scorsi anni si è stigmatizzato l'operato dei Governi di centrodestra per l'uso frequente di una legislazione d'urgenza e dei poteri commissariali, come se tale prassi fosse la cifra dei Governi del presidente Berlusconi: a distanza di anni le stesse prassi attecchiscono anche sotto altri Esecutivi, senza particolari e significative differenze.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.686519980430603, 0.31348004937171936]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, vorrei ragionare con i colleghi sul decreto-legge n. 19 per fronteggiare l'emergenza da Covid-19.

Sempre a Bologna, il 16 maggio le Sardine si divertono in un flash mob a difesa della cultura, dimenticando che Moro è stato ucciso dalle brigate rosse e non dalla mafia (ad ogni modo, non vedo il nesso fra cultura e Sardine, in verità). Arriviamo a noi: 16 maggio, a Roma, a Piazza del Popolo, alcuni ragazzi con delle mascherine tricolore vengono fermati, identificati e sanzionati. Ancora a maggio, manifestazione dei parrucchieri sotto Montecitorio: fermati, identificati e sanzionati.

Il primo è il ringraziamento al relatore, al sottosegretario Cancelleri e agli altri membri della Commissione per il lavoro svolto. Nemmeno ventiquattro ore di tempo per un provvedimento comunque importante, che alla fine contiene di tutto e di più. È un tempo veramente molto stretto. In Commissione abbiamo però lavorato bene, riuscendo comunque a portare a casa qualcosa, che non è esattamente quello che avremmo voluto. Avremmo voluto infatti entrare meglio nei temi, avremmo voluto anche correggere degli errori verificatisi nell\\' iter del provvedimento. Il lavoro comunque è stato proficuo, pur essendovi solo ordini del giorno, con la promessa da parte del Governo di tenere comunque in considerazione seriamente le proposte approvate. Penso siano proposte di buon senso, come quelle che noi della Lega siamo abituati a portare avanti. Penso ad esempio all\\'estensione alle persone disabili, affette da patologie oncologiche o malati gravi, l\\'esenzione dal pedaggio autostradale per trasferimenti, visite mediche specialistiche e cure o dal pagamento del biglietto ferroviario e la riduzione del 50 per cento per coloro che li accompagnano. Penso ancora agli incentivi per prendere le patenti necessarie per il trasporto merci, così come uscito dalla Camera, senza però dimenticare il trasporto delle persone. È un punto importante, una carenza fondamentale che riguarda gli autisti dei mezzi pesanti. Tale carenza può essere colmata esclusivamente incentivando i giovani ad affrontare questo tipo di lavoro, facendo incontrare la domanda e l\\'offerta del lavoro. Ci sono altre misure; l\\'obbligatorietà delle cinture di sicurezza sugli scuolabus, lo stanziamento di risorse per nuove assunzioni presso le motorizzazioni civili. Sappiamo bene, per esempio, nella mia provincia, Bergamo, ma anche nelle Province limitrofe, penso a Como, cosa voglia dire l\\'attesa fortissima delle patenti e delle revisioni per la mancanza di personale. L\\'opportunità di estendere le misure al resto e al Sud, oltre che alle isole minori, lagunari e lacustri, anche ai Comuni montani. Non possiamo pensare che i nostri Comuni montani siano abbandonati. <p> Sono proposte di buon senso che ha portato avanti la Lega e che sono state approvate come ordini del giorno; mi auguro veramente che con l\\'impegno del Governo possano diventare realtà. All\\'interno di questo provvedimento, che proviene dall\\'altra Camera, vi sono veramente impegni importanti, che riguardano: la tempestiva realizzazione degli interventi di adeguamento della pista olimpica di bob e slittino di Cortina d\\'Ampezzo, con uno stanziamento di 24,5 milioni di euro; agevolazioni per la società Infrastrutture Milano Cortina 2020-2026; semplificazioni dell\\' iter procedurale e accelerazione delle opere previste dal Piano. Non possiamo comunque perdere questa occasione. Le Olimpiadi rappresentano una sfida entusiasmante, un\\'occasione per tutto il Paese, importante per risolvere gli snodi dei collegamenti tra le nostre Regioni, che serviranno, sì, per le gare, ma anche in futuro per tutti i nostri cittadini. Tenere insieme più realtà è una buona occasione per coinvolgere i territori e fare in modo che non si perda questa preziosissima opportunità che ci viene offerta. Sono state approvate tantissime altre norme, ricordate anche da altri miei colleghi, come i parcheggi per le donne in gravidanza e per i genitori di bambini fino a due anni, i famosi \"stalli rosa\", che fino adesso non erano completamente normati. Vi è anche il regolamento sull\\'uso dei monopattini. Probabilmente quanto è stato approvato non basterà. Se è vero che, da una parte, i monopattini sono la rivoluzione verde (c\\'è tutta questa ideologia sul fatto che comunque è un mezzo di trasporto semplice e verde), dall\\'altro punto di vista dobbiamo stare attenti che questo green new non diventi maleducazione stradale, perché per adesso quello che abbiamo visto è questo. <p> È stata finalmente risolta la questione delle revisioni dei veicoli pesanti, anche per i rimorchi e per i semirimorchi. <p> Ci sono novità per comprendere nella categoria dei veicoli d\\'epoca di interesse e collezionismo anche i ciclomotori e le macchine agricole. <p> Vi è l\\'area di sosta gratuita per i veicoli dei disabili nei parcheggi a pagamento, qualora i loro stalli siano occupati. <p> Insomma, ci sono veramente tantissime cose importanti.

Parto da un dato che anch'io avevo segnalato ed è stato ripreso da molti: il provvedimento che è al nostro esame ha un iter lungo alle sue spalle, ma lasciatemi sottolineare che questo non significa che sia stato un trascorrere di tempo inutile. Alcune parti più urgenti del disegno di legge quale era in origine sono già in vigore, da tempo, essendo state oggetto di stralcio ed essendo state inserite in altri veicoli normativi, perché l'urgenza lì spingeva l'azione di Governo. Nel corso del tempo parti nuove si sono aggiunte sia nella prima lettura al Senato che alla Camera dei deputati. In ogni caso credo che tutti possano riconoscere che il disegno di legge conserva oggi una sua vera organicità, in parte con differenti caratterizzazioni, in parte conservando molti aspetti dell'impianto originario. Le novità derivano proprio da un maggior approfondimento e da un adattamento al mutato contesto politico e fattuale generale e settoriale. Non sto qui a ribadire - l'ho già fatto ieri in dettaglio - gli ambiti di intervento più importanti del disegno di legge. Lasciatemi però sottolineare una volta di più che sono ambiti di primario rilievo che hanno trovato appoggio e sostegno da parte del vasto mondo dei diretti interessati. Voglio anche citare - perché ne ho preso nota nel corso del dibattito - le problematiche che sono state sollevate, che afferiscono a materie indubbiamente importanti di cui è stata lamentata la non presenza nel disegno di legge. Ma anche qui l'osservazione che voglio fare è che non si tratta di un provvedimento omnibus. I temi che sono stati ricordati sono importanti: chi ha citato le quote latte, chi la concorrenza delle importazioni di riso dall'estero, chi l'agricoltura montana, chi l'istruzione agraria, chi le emergenze fitosanitarie e la ricerca scientifica, chi la criminalità agroambientale, chi i pesticidi, chi gli squilibri nella filiera agroalimentare, chi la tutela in generale del patrimonio agroalimentare italiano o l'importante tema dell'imprenditoria femminile in agricoltura. È vero, questi temi non sono considerati, nello specifico, all'interno di questo provvedimento, ma voglio segnalare - soprattutto a chi, tra i colleghi, non fa parte della Commissione agricoltura - che di alcune di queste tematiche la Commissione agricoltura già si sta occupando da tempo, con solerzia e con diligenza. Saremo, quindi, in grado di proporre all'Assemblea interventi specifici su questi temi nelle prossime settimane e nei prossimi mesi. Altri temi sono all'ordine del giorno o sono nei nostri progetti di intervento. Credo, dunque, che si possa dire che, complessivamente, il Senato, la sua Commissione e il Governo stanno cercando di delineare, nel corso di questa legislatura, un intervento organico sul complesso delle tematiche che riguardano il comparto primario. Voglio anche ringraziare i colleghi senatori che nei loro interventi hanno sottolineato come il provvedimento costituisca un segnale importante nel settore. Questo provvedimento rappresenta - lo dicevo già ieri - per certi versi un punto di arrivo, per altri un punto di partenza. Consegniamo nelle mani del Governo importanti deleghe e ci auguriamo che ci sia, da parte del Governo, un'azione sollecita affinché queste deleghe, una volta attuate, diano ulteriore certezza normativa al sistema. Peraltro, le disposizioni immediatamente precettive sono, per certi versi, ancora più numerose e importanti delle deleghe e consentiranno con immediatezza semplificazioni normative. Sottolineo questo tema: di semplificazioni il Parlamento e l'opinione pubblica dibattono da troppo tempo, ma le semplificazioni contenute in questo provvedimento rispondono ad importanti richieste e faciliteranno la vita e il lavoro degli addetti. Ci sono misure di sostegno in settori produttivi, misure di incontro tra domanda e offerta di terreni agricoli; interveniamo sulla funzionalità delle attività agricole mediante i contratti di rete, sul contrasto alle infrazioni in materia di pesca e di acquacultura e sul contrasto al bracconaggio ittico nelle acque interne. Mai come in questa legislatura - ne sono convinto, signora Presidente - la sinergia tra Governo e Parlamento ha consentito importanti interventi nel settore agricolo. Ricordo nuovamente - nessuno può dimenticarla - la legge sull'agricoltura sociale, quella sulla tutela della biodiversità agraria e alimentare, la conversione del decreto-legge sul rilancio del settore agricolo, oltre importanti profili di competenze in leggi più ampie, primo tra tutti il decreto-legge competitività. Ancora una volta, in questo campo i dati economici ci danno ragione. I dati economici confermano un andamento positivo del comparto agricolo; certo, non esente da criticità, ma il segno complessivo è nettamente positivo. Si tratta, quindi, di una tendenza che deve essere sostenuta e consolidata, perché può rendere ancora più importante l'azione dei nostri concittadini impegnati in questo settore; e questo nonostante non manchino le difficoltà, che provengono da cause naturali (le numerose calamità) o sono di tipo politico (penso all'embargo russo e alla concorrenza sempre sleale che dobbiamo verificare sui mercati esteri). A queste sfide stiamo rispondendo - e vogliamo sempre più rispondere - con la tutela delle eccellenze e delle qualità che rendono i nostri prodotti agroalimentari i più noti nel mondo. È per questo motivo che rinnovo l'invito ai colleghi del Senato a voler approvare questo provvedimento. <p> Signor Presidente, le chiedo di poter consegnare un testo integrativo del mio intervento affinché sia allegato al Resoconto stenografico della seduta odierna.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5040968060493469, 0.4959031641483307]}, {'sequence': \"Signora Presidente, onorevoli senatori, cari colleghi, il provvedimento che andremo ad approvare - come è stato già ben ricordato nell'intervento precedente - ha un'antica genesi, che risale a due legislature fa. Tuttavia, rimane immutata l'importanza e la necessità di concluderne l'approvazione, perché sappiamo quanto il settore agricolo versi in gravi difficoltà che persistono da molti, da troppi anni. <p> Provengo da una Regione a vocazione vitivinicola, da un territorio che produce eccellenze e che ha saputo mettersi in discussione a partire dagli anni Settanta-Ottanta, prediligendo a una produzione estensiva una produzione intensiva, quantitativamente ridotta e selezionata, che ha voluto guardare alla qualità della produzione anziché alla quantità. All'inizio poteva sembrare un'eresia rinunciare ai numeri della produzione, ma il tempo ha dato ragione a quella generazione di giovani imprenditori agricoli che hanno saputo compiere una scelta coraggiosa e, per molti versi, in antitesi al modo di pensare dei propri genitori e nonni. È l'esempio di una possibilità di scelta felice. Tuttavia, ci sono delle condizioni - il termine va inteso in senso letterale - che vanno oltre la volontà degli operatori e non permettono di scegliere, non permettono altre strade. Queste condizioni sono dettate dalla natura, dalla morfologia del territorio: per noi il costone carsico, che costeggia il mare sino a Trieste e ha caratteristiche morfologiche analoghe a quelle dei terreni destinati ad agrumeto, oggi oggetto di discussione. Anche in questo caso ci troviamo in una situazione in cui l'utilizzo dei macchinari è inibito dalla morfologia del terreno, il che comporta una lavorazione manuale. Anche in questo caso parliamo di piantumazioni intensive e non estensive. Anche in questo caso siamo in presenza di muri a secco che necessitano di continue manutenzioni. Anche in questo caso parliamo di zone soggette a rischio idrogeologico, che costituiscono un patrimonio storico nell'ambito della produzione di colture autoctone con modalità praticamente immutate nel tempo. Si tratta del territorio insulare delle fasce costiere di particolare pregio paesaggistico a rischio idrogeologico. <p> Questo preambolo vuole significare che i provvedimenti contenuti nel disegno di legge odierno - e mi riferisco in particolare allo stanziamento di contributi a sostegno di quanti sfidano il tempo e le leggi della libera concorrenza dei mercati - sono indispensabili per salvaguardare sia il territorio, inteso come patrimonio, da un degrado e da un progressivo abbandono, sia le eccellenze agroalimentari che contraddistinguono, qui come altrove, il nostro Paese a livello globale. <p> Con tutto il rispetto per la regolamentazione europea, che sappiamo indispensabile e alla quale abbiamo sottolineato nel provvedimento l'allineamento sulla base del principio contenuto nell'articolo 1 («Finalità»), non ci sono giustificazioni se per uniformare il mercato e le sue regole rischiamo di distruggere le peculiarità che contraddistinguono ciascun Paese della grande famiglia europea. <p> Sono dunque indispensabili norme per la tutela, il recupero e la salvaguardia dei preziosi agrumeti caratteristici dei territori che sono di particolare pregio per il Paese. Si tratta dei terrazzamenti delle nostre fasce costiere, come la costiera amalfitana, il Gargano, le coste calabre e della Sicilia, il Garda, dove la coltivazione degli agrumeti rappresenta non solo una fondamentale fonte di reddito, ma anche un importante fattore di salvaguardia ambientale, conservativo dell'integrità dei territori ed equilibrio naturale costiero. <p> Il provvedimento al nostro esame favorisce la conservazione dei paesaggi tradizionali e la tutela della biodiversità per valorizzare un prodotto dalle caratteristiche uniche. L'obiettivo dell'intervento legislativo è pertanto sostenere una delle coltivazioni caratteristiche del nostro territorio costiero e insulare nel Mediterraneo, rilanciando l'agrumicoltura italiana da anni in uno stato di profonda crisi; crisi determinata da costi di produzione insostenibili per la presenza di aziende di piccole dimensioni, poco raccordate tra di loro e con l'industria di trasformazione e la distribuzione; con strategie di promozione e commercializzazione obsolete, che non reggono più alla sempre maggiore concorrenza estera. <p> L'asperità dei luoghi poco accessibili con mezzi meccanici - come ho già detto - determina il ricorso a un lavoro manuale che oggi è poco economico e faticoso sia per le colture che per il trasporto. Da ciò deriva l'abbandono da parte dei coltivatori, già evidenziato dalla collega che mi ha preceduto; coltivatori pochi e anziani che ancora praticano la cosiddetta agricoltura eroica, con il degrado del tessuto sociale e la perdita di un lavoro diventato con il tempo una parte fondamentale della cultura di quei territori, ma anche con la progressiva alterazione del paesaggio. È infatti sempre più vistosa la presenza di zone incolte e di danni all'assetto del territorio, privato della manutenzione degli agricoltori, e sono sempre più visibili fenomeni di dissesto idrogeologico, per la perdita della funzione dei muretti a secco che i terrazzamenti svolgono nell'opera di contenimento sia delle acque che dei terreni. <p> Come dicevo inizialmente per il costone carsico, va fermato il lento e inesorabile degrado e l'abbandono di quei territori, sostenendo chi opera per la salvaguardia di un inestimabile paesaggio rurale e di produzioni di qualità unica. Ecco perché voglio rivolgere un plauso ai parlamentari che hanno saputo concludere l' iter legislativo di un provvedimento molto atteso da tutti i produttori di agrumi, soprattutto da quelli più piccoli, che, con difficoltà e tanta fatica, hanno saputo resistere in questi anni, a costo di grandi sacrifici. A questi agricoltori va il merito, con riconoscenza, di mantenere vivo lo straordinario, spettacolare paesaggio costiero.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.8129016757011414, 0.18709829449653625]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> ANITORI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, vorrei esprimere un generale apprezzamento per i contenuti di questo decreto-legge, poiché il provvedimento è finalizzato a raggiungere un'efficace composizione tra le diverse esigenze che devono essere soddisfatte nell'amministrazione della giustizia, all'urgenza di assicurare celerità e sburocratizzazione dei procedimenti, alla necessità di assicurare condizioni di lavoro che favoriscano la professionalità e l'efficienza dei magistrati. Intendo quindi fare riferimento ad alcuni passaggi significativi del disegno di legge: in primis la previsione dell'articolo 1, in forza della quale i magistrati addetti all'ufficio del massimario e del ruolo possono essere impiegati eccezionalmente per comporre i collegi giudicanti, tanto civili quanto penali, della Corte di cassazione, con la giusta finalità di rafforzare i presidi organizzativi necessari ad un più rapido smaltimento dell'arretrato. Sempre trattando questo argomento, è apprezzabile l'intervento della Camera in prima lettura, che ha limitato l'applicazione della disposizione ai soli magistrati che abbiano conseguito la terza valutazione di professionalità e ponendo un limite triennale non rinnovabile. All'articolo 2 si prevedono misure per migliorare l'efficienza degli uffici giudiziari: per coprire i vuoti di organico della magistratura ordinaria, si aumenterà sino a un decimo il numero dei posti disponibili tra quelli messi a concorso nel biennio 2014-2015; inoltre, sarà possibile ottenere una più rapida copertura dei posti vacanti nell'organico degli uffici giudiziari di primo grado attraverso la riduzione del tirocinio, da diciotto a dodici mesi, dei magistrati dichiarati idonei all'esito di concorsi banditi negli anni 2014 e 2015. Inoltre, per quanto riguarda la normativa dell'articolo 3, vorrei sottolineare come essa riguardi esclusivamente il periodo di legittimazione entro il quale un magistrato può fare domanda di trasferimento ad altro incarico o ad altra funzione. L'allungamento a quattro anni è dettato dalla considerazione, peraltro facilmente condivisibile, che il termine triennale non sia pienamente sufficiente affinché il magistrato possa dare un contributo effettivo al pieno assolvimento degli incarichi assegnati: nel momento in cui si entra in un sistema, infatti, dobbiamo garantire un orizzonte temporale che metta il magistrato nelle condizioni di svolgere quella funzione con la necessaria progettualità delle scelte dell'ufficio e con la più alta stabilità della posizione, prerequisito per il pieno manifestarsi di professionalità e capacità. Ritengo quindi vada nella direzione giusta anche la norma dell'articolo 4, finalizzata a sfruttare tutte le risorse umane disponibili all'interno degli organici: si stabilisce, infatti, che il personale delle cancellerie e delle segreterie giudiziarie e il personale assegnato agli uffici di sorveglianza non possa essere destinato temporaneamente ad altri uffici del distretto giudiziario di appartenenza senza il nulla-osta del presidente del tribunale di sorveglianza. Parallelamente e coerentemente, fino al 31 dicembre 2019 il personale non dirigenziale del Ministero della giustizia non potrà essere comandato, distaccato o assegnato ad altre amministrazioni. L'intervento degli articoli 5 e 10 del decreto-legge, lungi dal rappresentare violazioni dei principi relativi all'uguaglianza e alla parità di trattamento, tantomeno ingerenze nelle competenze di un ordine autonomo ed indipendente come la magistratura, come pure si è sentito durante la discussione presso l'altro ramo del Parlamento e anche in questo Senato, deve intendersi strettamente circoscritto nel tempo e finalizzato esclusivamente ad assicurare continuità negli incarichi apicali e direttivi presso la suprema Corte di cassazione, la relativa procura generale, la Corte dei conti e l'Avvocatura dello Stato, in ragione delle molteplici richieste di riforma per la definizione del contenzioso pendente. Il Capo II del decreto-legge è dedicato al processo amministrativo telematico. Gli articoli in questione recano importanti previsioni finalizzate a consentire l'entrata in funzione del processo amministrativo telematico, dettando precise norme di coordinamento ed adeguamento della disciplina a principi di buon senso, funzionalità e semplicità degli adempimenti. Nello specifico, i nuovi meccanismi procedimentali basati sulla tecnologia, il cui avvio è già previsto per il 1° gennaio 2017, saranno promossi semplificandone l'operatività, attraverso l'introduzione di misure atte ad armonizzare gli strumenti del processo amministrativo telematico con il codice dell'amministrazione digitale. Mi riferisco in particolar modo al domicilio digitale e all'estensione agli avvocati difensori della attestazione dell'efficacia probatoria delle copia per immagine di documenti cartacei. Allo stesso obiettivo tendono le misure finalizzate a estendere l'utilizzo delle modalità di deposito degli atti anche per i soggetti non dotati di posta elettronica certificata. Per concludere, colleghi, questo è un provvedimento di urgenza che, dopo essere stato anche debitamente integrato dal Parlamento, fornisce degli strumenti rapidi, concreti ed efficaci per continuare ad aggredire, al di là delle solite e sterili critiche preconcette, i mali cronici che affliggono il settore della giustizia del nostro Paese.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7712076902389526, 0.22879229485988617]}, {'sequence': 'Signora Presidente, questo decreto valore cultura è un provvedimento atteso da tempo, ed è sicuramente meritorio che il Governo abbia tentato di dare risposte a un settore cruciale per lo sviluppo del nostro Paese. Ci sono tante buone intenzioni, altrettante cose buone, ma altrettante ombre, lo devo dire con franchezza; ciò che manca è soprattutto un progetto d\\'insieme e quello che stride di più è il ritorno in grande stile all\\'approccio statalista e assistenzialista - come nel caso delle fondazioni liriche - a discapito di un necessario percorso di riforme liberali. Ma il difetto più grande forse sta nel reperimento delle risorse con il solito sistema dell\\'aumento delle accise, imposto dal solito Ministero dell\\'economia, recentemente ribattezzato con un azzeccato neologismo: «Ministero della benzina». Il vizio è sempre lo stesso: inventare nuove tasse a discapito di uno sviluppo coerente del settore che premi chi ha saputo gestire oculatamente i propri bilanci, invece di gettare milioni e milioni di euro a fondo perduto. <p> Ci voleva più coraggio, insomma, e il Popolo della Libertà, attraverso i suoi emendamenti, ha spinto con forza verso la strada maestra di una defiscalizzazione che favorisca l\\'intervento dei privati nella cultura. Noi non ci arrendiamo comunque a chi, per comodità, non trova di meglio per le coperture finanziarie che pescare nelle tasche dei cittadini, invece di tagliare la spesa statale improduttiva. Il decreto prevede infatti che saranno ancora una volta le accise a finanziare per 50 milioni di euro il tax credit permanente al settore del cinema, misura che peraltro va nella giusta direzione e che è stata chiesta a gran voce dalle imprese operanti nel settore, che altrimenti avrebbero enormi difficoltà a pianificare ulteriori investimenti per il futuro. I nuovi balzelli andranno a incidere poi sui prodotti da fumo, sugli oli lubrificanti e sull\\'alcol. Ma è la filosofia che ispira questo provvedimento ad essere la cosa più discutibile. Il reperimento delle risorse avviene al solito modo: si va pervicacemente sempre ad incidere sui consumi, si tolgono fondi, anche se in via provvisoria (e speriamo che il Governo al riguardo mantenga la parola, nel senso di una rapida restituzione a quel capitolo di spesa), al provvedimento paga-imprese, una misura che tante piccole e medie aziende aspettano da anni e le cui attese non possono andare ancora una volta deluse. Una volta definiti i nostri paletti sugli aspetti finanziari, mi preme chiarire anche i termini di una polemica inutile, sollevata dal sindaco di Firenze sull\\'ipotesi che il <PARTY> abbia voluto boicottare i Grandi Uffizi per rappresaglia verso alcune infelici dichiarazioni dello stesso Renzi. Da toscano non posso che essere felice dell\\'attenzione che questo Governo dimostra nei confronti di Firenze, anche se devo rilevare che il sindaco, ex rottamatore e ora aspirante asfaltatore, si atteggia come se fosse Lorenzo il Magnifico, anche se sotto la sua amministrazione il Maggio musicale fiorentino ha raggiunto il fallimento. Ma, lasciando da parte le polemiche renziane, sui Nuovi Uffizi c\\'è un punto sul quale vigileremo con grande attenzione: la relazione annessa al decreto dice infatti che «Dal momento che i finanziamenti disponibili non consentivano di appaltare l\\'intero progetto, unitariamente concepito, lo stesso è stato successivamente suddiviso in due lotti. Attualmente restano da finanziare lavori per un totale di 50.600.000 euro, al fine di portare a completamento il progetto». E prosegue testualmente: «Al fine di non vanificare la possibilità di continuare con l\\'affidamento all\\'ATI,» - leggasi cooperative rosse - «esecutrice dei lavori dei \"Nuovi Uffizi\" degli stralci successivi, mediante una procedura negoziata, è indispensabile che vi sia un flusso costante di finanziamenti adeguati...». Ebbene, qui poniamo una questione ineludibile di trasparenza, perché sarebbe quantomeno anomalo affidare tout court a chi ha vinto solo il primo appalto tutta l\\'esecuzione dei lavori. È un problema che poniamo e sul quale attendiamo risposte precise. Sempre per quanto riguarda Firenze, abbiamo presentato un ordine del giorno per garantire l\\'autonomia dell\\'Opificio delle pietre dure e per incrementarne il personale. Stiamo parlando - per chi non lo sapesse - di una delle poche eccellenze mondiali che ci rimangono. Visto che è stato fortunatamente ritirato il progetto che intendeva definitivamente annettere l\\'Opificio al Polo museale fiorentino, mi sembra ovvio e naturale che l\\'Opificio venga messo in grado di funzionare al meglio, con un trasferimento di personale senza alcun onere aggiuntivo per le casse dello Stato. Mi avvio a concludere sottolineando che questo decreto valore cultura rappresenta un atto dovuto nei confronti di un settore così importante anche come volano di sviluppo economico, ma è stato concepito con una visione troppo statalista e con un approccio che manca di organicità. La chiamata, ad esempio, di 500 giovani che verranno impiegati come tirocinanti per catalogare il patrimonio culturale rischia di trasformarsi nell\\'ennesima fabbrica delle illusioni. Così come il «Grande Progetto Pompei» non dovrà ricalcare vecchie esperienze di carrozzoni che si sono rivelati inutili o insufficienti a dare risposte concrete a un patrimonio culturale di valore inestimabile. C\\'è un ultimo aspetto da rimarcare: le imprese che operano in Italia nel campo culturale e creativo si trovano a fronteggiare problemi enormi nell\\'accesso al credito, a causa dell\\'incapacità delle banche di valutare adeguatamente il patrimonio immateriale (le idee, come avviene ad esempio negli Stati Uniti). Ci sarebbe bisogno, insomma, di una rivoluzione culturale che in questo decreto non c\\'è, anche se approvandolo cercheremo di vedere il bicchiere mezzo pieno, ripromettendoci di lavorare perché la politica dia al più presto una risposta all\\'altezza, in grado di sfruttare finalmente a pieno regime le potenzialità di un patrimonio culturale e artistico unico nel mondo.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5711064338684082, 0.4288935363292694]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> <PARTY>IMBERTI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, colleghi senatori, mi sia consentito innanzitutto ringraziare la senatrice Pelino per lo spirito e il lavoro che ha svolto nel portare avanti il disegno di legge in esame. L'industria aerospaziale riveste carattere strategico nelle economie avanzate, in quanto generatrice di ricchezza e di alte tecnologie, e l'Italia, con i suoi due miliardi di euro, si posiziona al terzo posto in Europa dietro solo a Germania e Francia. Chi mi ha preceduto ha sottolineato come il ritorno economico delle attività di ricerca e applicazione tecnologica di questo settore siano di ben cinque volte superiori agli investimenti, con una concreta ricaduta sull'intero comparto industriale, perché dal settore aerospaziale derivano più brevetti e applicazioni che riguardano interi settori: dalle telecomunicazioni alla sicurezza, dalle infrastrutture alle costruzioni e persino alla farmacologia. Desidero sottolineare come il settore aerospaziale sia un'eccellenza italiana. Difatti, nonostante il nostro modello economico sia composto di una rete di medie e piccole industrie, si conferma all'avanguardia anche nei vari livelli che compongono la catena produttiva. E lo dimostrano i numerosi successi raccolti in questi anni nelle varie missioni spaziali a cui abbiamo contribuito mediante moduli abitativi, sistemi di comunicazione, satelliti scientifici e sistemi di propulsione. Si pensi alle numerose collaborazioni con la NASA, ormai consolidate negli anni, nonché alla nostra partecipazione con un ruolo primario all'ESA, Agenzia spaziale europea. Ed è proprio in ambito europeo che un'azienda italiana, la AVIO, ha fatto segnare l'ennesimo traguardo: la produzione del più grande motore monolitico in fibra di carbonio a propellente solido mai realizzato al mondo, che equipaggerà i nuovi lanciatori europei. Tuttavia, la grande dinamicità e l'efficienza delle nostre imprese non sono sufficienti a permettere al settore di dispiegare le potenzialità che realmente si possiedono. Serve infatti un'organizzazione unitaria e una politica industriale complessiva che impongano quelle risposte efficaci e quella visione strategica di cui il nostro Paese avrebbe un disperato bisogno, ma che gli ultimi Governi non sono stati in grado di garantire. Pertanto, il Gruppo Forza Italia non può che guardare con favore a un provvedimento che punta a dotare i settori spaziali e aerospaziali di un nuovo sistema di Governo che tenga sempre più presente la complessità delle sfide del comparto, la necessità di un approccio olistico garantito da un coordinamento strutturato e di ridare centralità al dibattito sul ruolo dell'industria spaziale in Italia; un compito fino a oggi egregiamente svolto dall'Agenzia spaziale italiana, che ha saputo guidare il settore rimanendo sempre all'avanguardia nel mondo, ma che ora sarà reso ancora più agevole grazie alla creazione di un comitato di coordinamento, posto sotto la direzione e la responsabilità politica del Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, che possa efficacemente affiancare l'ASI. Per sottolineare la reale inversione di tendenza e la centralità che si intende dare al tema delle politiche aerospaziali è sufficiente scorrere l'elenco dei Ministri previsti da questo provvedimento nel Comitato interministeriale per le politiche relative allo spazio e alla ricerca aerospaziale: dieci Ministri a cui si aggiungono il Presidente della Conferenza dei Presidenti delle Regioni e il Presidente dell'Agenzia spaziale italiana. Alla luce di quanto appena esposto e nella speranza che il percorso intrapreso per il settore aerospaziale con questo disegno di legge, mediante la definizione di strategie, politiche industriali, sinergie e linee di sviluppo, possa rappresentare la strada maestra da seguire per lo sviluppo dell'intero Paese con una politica industriale degna di questo nome, annuncio il voto favorevole del Gruppo Forza Italia.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5253130197525024, 0.47468698024749756]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, intervengo per illustrare l'ordine del giorno G7.300, che sostituisce l'emendamento 7.0.7 da me ritirato. <p> L'ordine del giorno riguarda una questione apparentemente secondaria, ma paradigmatica delle varie questioni insolute del nostro Paese: un terremoto da tutti dimenticato o rimosso, quello del 1967 nella valle del Belice. <p> Parecchi sanno, come credo anche lei signor Presidente, come in quelle zone della Sicilia ci siano ancora dei territori e delle popolazioni che gridano vendetta nei confronti dei ritardi dello Stato e della burocrazia.

Accade infatti che i finanziamenti continuino ad arrivare nei territori, ma a pioggia, cioè non sono finalizzati verso iniziative realmente utili.

Nelle carte si parla di ritrovamento - cito testualmente - «di un gruppo di statue, presumibilmente di bronzo» e non solo di due. La descrizione delle statue fatta dal subacqueo, che le scoprì, non coincide con quelle a noi note. Inoltre mancherebbero, tra i reperti pervenuti, almeno uno scudo, un elmo e una lancia che sono invece citati nei documenti di ritrovamento.

Mi permetto soltanto di sottolineare come a mio parere vada dedicata la massima attenzione a questa vicenda, nonostante l'attività di indagine già svolta negli anni passati, perché credo che questi reperti rappresentino il simbolo più importante della nostra tradizione culturale e rappresentino, inoltre, non soltanto il simbolo di una grande storia ma anche, considerato il numero dei visitatori che hanno prodotto e che il Ministero certifica in crescita esponenziale presso il museo archeologico di Reggio Calabria, il simbolo di una Regione (la Calabria), del meridione d'Italia e dell'Italia intera che vuole rinascere e tornare grande. <p> La cultura è un frammento di eternità che ci aiuta a vivere, quindi merita la massima attenzione da parte di chi rappresenta lo Stato.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6508013010025024, 0.34919869899749756]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, il provvedimento al nostro esame avrebbe dovuto rappresentare una vera e propria strategia per l'economia della nostra Nazione, soprattutto a tutela di due soggetti: le imprese e i cittadini. Questo decreto-legge avrebbe dovuto guardare, sì, alla nostra generazione, ma soprattutto a quelle future, che tra le mani si troveranno, invece, una pessima eredità lasciata da questo Governo. <p> Siete davvero poco credibili e la dimostrazione risiede soprattutto nelle tematiche che state affrontando, che secondo voi sono le priorità. Parliamo del POS obbligatorio con relative sanzioni per chi non si adegua; della lotteria degli scontrini; dell'obbligo di fatturazione elettronica per coloro che addirittura rientrano nel regime forfettario. Anziché lavorare per risolvere i problemi dei cittadini e delle imprese, l'ultimo Consiglio dei ministri decide bene di rinviare a una data che non conosciamo, quindi non ben definita, gli interventi relativi all'energia. Ebbene, penso che peggio di così non possiate fare! Le imprese italiane, come sappiamo tutti - non lo dice <PARTY> - sono in grande affanno: il 30 per cento ha ridotto la propria produzione e nel giro di pochissimo, a detta di tutte le associazioni di categoria, i danni saranno incalcolabili. <p> Al netto di tutti i provvedimenti che state portando avanti, anche in maniera molto forzata, dal nostro punto di vista continua a mancare la praticità nonché una strategia, e non smetteremo mai di dirlo. <p> Nel provvedimento che ci apprestiamo a votare la cosa peggiore è che non si semplifica nulla: continua a permanere il grave ostacolo all'innovazione e anche agli investimenti, che invece dovremmo in qualche modo attrarre. Oggi, cioè, chi viene a investire in Italia trova una montagna da scalare e questo funge da disincentivo. Certo, noi di <PARTY> non siamo e non saremo mai per un consumo del suolo selvaggio, ma non possiamo rimanere ostaggio. <p> Dobbiamo dire che in questi anni ci sono stati grandi progressi in termini scientifici, anche per quanto riguarda i materiali innovativi, e questo ci potrebbe permettere di governare il processo di transizione energetica nei territori e anche nelle nostre città. Sappiamo perfettamente che non esiste impatto zero. <p> Ciò che manca in questo provvedimento è chiaro, ovvero un riferimento ai carburanti, che oggigiorno rappresentano sicuramente uno dei costi più alti che sia le aziende sia i cittadini devono affrontare. <p> Quindi, questo è certamente un problema e il Governo, ad oggi, ha fatto poco o addirittura nulla. <p> Non dimentichiamo che l'inflazione nel mese di marzo è salita al 6,7 per cento. Quello dei trasporti, che è un settore sicuramente molto importante per quanto riguarda il nostro Paese - soprattutto quello su gomma - svolge un ruolo primario e rappresenta altresì un settore chiave per quanto riguarda il fronte dell'occupazione, ragion per cui l'obiettivo sarebbe quello di abbattere immediatamente l'accisa del 40 per cento, come da noi più volte proposto in tutte le varie Commissioni. Bisogna anche intervenire sull'IVA e non creare disparità, come denunciano tante associazioni di settore. Un'intera filiera rischia di essere messa in ginocchio per colpa di questo Governo che ha creato una vera e propria concorrenza tra carburanti. È chiaro che questa situazione è diventata insostenibile, sia per gli operatori del comparto ma soprattutto per gli utenti. Il processo di transizione ecologica, di cui tanto si parla (e, come prediligo definirlo, di conversione ecologica, perché di fatto sono tutte conversioni), è irreversibile e cruciale e deve portare l'Italia verso il definitivo abbandono delle fonti fossili e ad adottare fonti energetiche più sostenibili, come dicevo prima. Signor Presidente, sappiamo perfettamente che nulla è a impatto zero, ma dobbiamo abituarci anche all'idea che non si può più procrastinare e che servono anche delle scelte sensate e coraggiose. <p> In questo provvedimento, come dicevo prima, non vedo affatto semplificazione. Questo decreto-legge, purtroppo, crea invece ulteriore burocrazia e soprattutto confusione. Quella stessa burocrazia rappresenta, forse, il peggior limite per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi di decarbonizzazione, tanto agognati. Tali limiti, chiaramente, non ci consentiranno mai, continuando di questo passo, a raggiungere ciò che serve al nostro Paese, cioè l'indipendenza energetica. <p> Il vero incubo, soprattutto negli ultimi anni, è la realizzazione degli impianti FER (fonti energia rinnovabile), ma la mancanza di procedure snelle disincentiva gli investimenti nel nostro Paese. Non dimentichiamo che la Germania ha iniziato a correre, varando anche un piano importante per installare 20 gigawatt all'anno per i prossimi tre anni, che andrà ad accelerare per aumentare fino a 40 gigawatt fino al 2035. Stessa cosa sta facendo la Francia. E l'Italia? Nulla, e questo sicuramente è un demerito vostro. <p> L'obiettivo è evitare di perdere le grandi opportunità che ci vengono fornite, come abbiamo sempre detto in quest'Aula, dal PNRR. Dobbiamo ricordare a noi tutti che saranno i nostri figli e anche nipoti coloro che ripagheranno il debito. Pertanto, è opportuno che esso venga realmente investito anche in maniera strategica. <p> Ciò che manca oggi non è soltanto la strategia, ma anche la lungimiranza. Non avete approvato alcuna soluzione per quanto riguarda la promozione dell'autoproduzione e dell'autoconsumo di energia per famiglie e imprese. Bisogna incentivare l'efficientamento energetico degli edifici. <p> Non dimentichiamo che una buona parte degli uffici delle pubbliche amministrazioni è vecchia ed obsoleta. E io voglio denunciare, in quest'Aula, anche gli sprechi di riscaldamento nelle strutture pubbliche, di cui nessuno parla e che rappresentano un vero schiaffo a tutte quelle famiglie che oggi stentano ad arrivare a fine mese e che non sanno come pagare le bollette dell'energia. <p> Nessun accenno neanche al made in Italy e agli incentivi per rilanciare la produzione nazionale del settore e anche dell'indotto. Abbiamo dimenticato completamente i territori che sono stati colpiti dal sisma. Si poteva e si doveva fare di più per la realizzazione di sistemi centralizzati per la produzione e distribuzione nella comunità. Le leggi dovrebbero prevedere alcune misure, ma non lo fanno più da tanto tempo e questo è sicuramente un grande problema. Quando la sinistra era una sinistra sociale, diceva che c'era un evidente problema di modello di sviluppo. Oggi non dice più nulla. La necessità di approvvigionarsi di gas, soprattutto in questo periodo, sicuramente esiste, ma non possiamo e non dobbiamo fare lo stesso errore che abbiamo fatto con la Russia e che <PARTY> ha sempre rimarcato. L'autosufficienza per noi è sicuramente importante ed è chiaro che oggi andare nel Qatar, piuttosto che in Algeria, serve. L'autosufficienza, però, prevede una battaglia seria e di questo, nel provvedimento al nostro esame, non si dice nulla. In questo decreto-legge non si parla neanche del piano per la transizione energetica. In conclusione, signor Presidente, siamo sinceramente preoccupati anche per la superficialità con cui viene trattata una materia così delicata. Questa è una situazione, come dicevo prima, sicuramente insostenibile e non si può e non si deve scaricare il tema dell'insufficienza energetica italiana sui singoli cittadini e sulle singole famiglie, perché questo metterebbe in ginocchio le nostre imprese. Gli italiani vi guardano, vi sentono. Sicuramente senza strategia questo Paese non avrà nulla. Questo è un decreto-legge vuoto, che, come dicevo prima, manca di strategia e di lungimiranza.

C'è anche un'altra piccola anomalia, che rilevo senza polemica ma per far capire meglio anche a tutta l'Aula: la relazione consuntiva è arrivata in Commissione dopo la relazione programmatica. Quindi questa sera, di fatto, la relazione consuntiva segue a quella programmatica solo perché questo è ciò che è accaduto dal punto di vista dei lavori. <p> È vero che è passato un po' di tempo e che c'è un po' di ritardo, ma è comunque utile ed importante fare una valutazione, anche ex post, della partecipazione dell'Italia all'Unione per poter fare un ragionamento che ci consenta di indicare dove dare continuità all'azione amministrativa che si è avviata, e dove invece occorre dare eventualmente indirizzi diversi. Fornirò brevemente alcune spiegazioni su come è composto questo documento. La relazione è stata redatta in base a quanto prescritto dall'articolo 13 della legge n. 234 del 2012, ed è articolata in quattro parti. La prima riguarda gli sviluppi del processo di integrazione europea; la seconda concerne la partecipazione dell'Italia alla realizzazione delle principali politiche settoriali; la terza parte tratta della partecipazione dell'Italia al processo normativo dell'Unione, compresi quindi i temi della formazione e comunicazione in materia europea e il coinvolgimento dei cittadini, su cui dirò qualcosa più avanti; la quarta ed ultima parte descrive le politiche di coesione, l'andamento dei flussi finanziari e la loro utilizzazione, nonché i risultati dell'attività svolta. Entriamo nel merito dei contenuti. L'attività del 2012 è stata dominata dai temi economici e finanziari, con l'obiettivo di mantenere la stabilità dell'area euro e rendere operative le misure di governance. È evidente e sotto gli occhi di tutti che il particolare momento congiunturale e la crisi strutturale che stiamo attraversando, che affligge i Paesi europei, non ha tuttora consentito - è inutile negarlo - di produrre effetti visibili. Ad onor del vero, anche alla luce delle notizie che oggi vengono dal premier Letta circa l'incontro in Europa, dei passi in avanti ci sono stati, ma non ancora con gli effetti sperati. Su deciso impulso del Governo, l'impegno politico del Consiglio europeo del 28 e 29 giugno 2012 in materia di crescita economica si è tradotto nel Patto per la crescita e l'occupazione, che articola in modo organico le misure di rilancio da affiancare alla normativa sulla disciplina di bilancio. Per quanto riguarda il rafforzamento dell'architettura istituzionale dell'Unione economica e monetaria, da parte italiana si è espresso il pieno sostegno a favore di un credibile ed ambizioso processo di riforma, assicurando anche il coinvolgimento del Parlamento europeo e dei singoli Parlamenti nazionali. Le prospettive di riforma dell'Unione economica e monetaria si articolano su quattro assi: definizione di un quadro integrato nel settore finanziario (la cosiddetta unione bancaria); nuova cornice comune in materia fiscale e di bilancio; integrazione delle politiche economiche; legittimità e controllo democratico del processo decisionale. Per quanto riguarda il quadro finanziario pluriennale 2014-2020, la posizione italiana al tavolo è stata da un lato quella di migliorare il saldo netto nazionale e dall'altro lato quella di avere un approccio globale, ispirato ai principi di uso efficiente delle risorse, della solidarietà e dell'equità. (Brusìo). Signora Presidente, mi scusi, ma con questo brusìo è davvero complicato andare avanti. Capisco l'ora e il fatto che siamo tutti stanchi, ma fare un ultimo sforzo forse sarà più utile a tutti. <p> Dicevo, migliorare il saldo netto secondo principi di solidarietà ed equità. Ciò significa riconoscere che esistono di fatto beni pubblici europei che possono essere protetti unicamente, o in maniera più efficiente, a livello di Unione europea, riconoscendo il loro essere beni pubblici. <p> Nell'ambito della dimensione esterna dell'Unione, l'obiettivo di rafforzare il ruolo dell'Unione europea sulla scena internazionale è stato predominante, e l'esigenza è di parlare con una sola voce. A tale proposito, la risoluzione ONU sullo status rafforzato dell'Unione europea in senso all'Assemblea generale delle Nazioni Unite è stato un risultato per il quale il Governo italiano si è battuto. In tema di allargamento, il Governo ha lavorato per garantire un adeguato riconoscimento dei progressi negoziali registrati dai Paesi candidati, in particolare per la Serbia, il Kosovo e il Montenegro. E tutti quanti abbiamo salutato l'ingresso della Croazia nell'Unione europea qualche giorno fa. In tema di politiche europee di vicinato, in particolare con riguardo alla sponda Sud del Mediterraneo, l'Italia ha rimarcato la necessità di fornire risposte adeguate alle istanze espresse dai Paesi in cui si è verificata la cosiddetta primavera araba, dal punto di vista del sostegno politico ed economico, ma anche del portare a compimento partenariati privilegiati, con la definizione di nuovi piani di azione con Marocco, Tunisia, Egitto e Libia. Per quanto concerne la cooperazione allo sviluppo, come diceva il collega che mi ha preceduto, l'Italia è il terzo contribuente al bilancio dell'Unione europea e il quarto contribuente al fondo europeo di sviluppo. Ovviamente, da questo punto di vista l'iniziativa è specificatamente rivolta al raggiungimento di obiettivi di sviluppo del millennio entro il 2015, con un particolare focus sulla sfida storica rappresentata dalla primavera araba e sul nesso tra migrazione e sviluppo. L'Italia ha sostenuto molto l'azione dell'Alto rappresentante Ashton volto a rafforzare le relazioni con i Paesi terzi in materia commerciale. Sempre in materia commerciale, e considerate le specifiche caratteristiche del sistema produttivo e industriale italiano, allo scopo di tutelare le sue tante eccellenze, il Governo ha sostenuto con successo la necessità di pervenire ad accordi commerciali equilibrati, mutuamente vantaggiosi e ispirati al principio di reciprocità, che perseguano in maniera incisiva e contestuale sia gli interessi commerciali sia la tutela del sistema produttivo degli Stati membri. Quindi, non una chiusura e una tutela, ma anche la possibilità di sviluppo. In questo contesto, il Governo si è impegnato perché venisse raggiunta una soluzione di compromesso per l'adozione di una regolamentazione sulla etichettatura di origine di alcuni prodotti provenienti da Paesi terzi (il cosiddetto made in). In seguito alla decisione della Commissione di ritirare la proposta, l'Italia ha chiesto alla Commissione di valutare possibili soluzioni alternative e di fornire una analisi giuridica dettagliata per definire uno schema di etichettatura a tutela dei consumatori, della trasparenza sui mercati e della concorrenza leale, suscettibile di non essere considerato un ostacolo tecnico ma, anzi, uno strumento per contrastare l'uso fraudolento delle indicazioni di origine europea. È evidente che su alcune questioni si è andato avanti, perché questo è un consuntivo e, nel frattempo, è intervenuta l'azione svolta primi mesi del 2013. Nel settore della politica di sicurezza e di difesa comune, tramite le proprie Forze armate l'Italia è risultata nel 2012 il quarto Paese ad aver contributo per la lotta alla pirateria. Per quanto riguarda gli affari interni, l'Italia si è impegnata per le problematiche connesse all'immigrazione illegale, anche se, da questo punto di vista, dobbiamo riscontrare forti resistenze da parte degli Stati membri non direttamente coinvolti nella gestione delle frontiere esterne, soprattutto di quelle marittime dell'Unione europea. Nell'ambito delle politiche relative al mercato interno si è avviato un processo di revisione delle diverse discipline esistenti per la valutazione della compatibilità degli aiuti di Stato con le regole del Trattato. In tema di proprietà intellettuale, per quanto concerne la creazione del brevetto europeo (di questo tema abbiamo parlato lungamente con il Ministro, e sono state poi anche fornite indicazioni). Italia e Spagna avevano presentato un ricorso alla Corte di giustizia sulla modalità di utilizzo della cooperazione rafforzata. Ma - a questo non è riportato nella relazione, perché è accaduto dopo, ma ovviamente ne diamo comunque contezza - il 16 aprile 2013 la Corte si è espressa nel senso del rigetto di questo ricorso. Occorre quindi valutare se aderire al sistema di brevetto europeo, oppure come andare avanti. Nell'ambito delle politiche sociali, l'iniziativa-faro è costituita dalla Piattaforma europea contro la povertà e l'emarginazione. Il Senato, in particolare, sta lavorando e producendo proposte, perché questo fenomeno colpisce in particolare la fascia di età minorile. Nel settore dell'istruzione si è lavorato per enfatizzare il ruolo dell'educazione come strumento della Strategia Europa 2020 e sull'esigenza di modernizzare l'istruzione superiore attraverso cinque direttive politiche, sulle quali autorità nazionali e istituti di istruzione superiore stanno lavorando e si confrontano. Così come per la cultura, dove si è lavorato molto per rendere il tema della diversità culturale e l'accesso alla cultura un tema predominante, anche attraverso la promozione di partnership creative. Nel settore del turismo, interessante è la prospettiva dell'istituzione di un marchio di qualità europeo, che si propone di aumentare la fiducia e la sicurezza dei consumatori nei prodotti turistici e di premiare gli sforzi dell'industria per offrire servizi di qualità. Sulla sanità i temi affrontati hanno riguardato non soltanto la libera circolazione nella somministrazione delle prestazioni dei sanitari, ma è stata anche rivolta attenzione alle gravi minacce per la salute a carattere transfrontaliero, rispetto cioè a come muoversi eventualmente in situazioni di questo tipo. In materia di tutela dei consumatori si segnala l'approvazione da parte del Consiglio, in data 11 ottobre 2012, di una risoluzione sull'agenda europea del consumatore che dovrebbe quindi portare a una proposta di regolamento volta a risolvere le controversie on line, con l'obiettivo di snellire la burocrazia e di portare al regolamento delle controversie on line. L'attività di ricerca e sviluppo presenta a mio avviso un dato molto interessante, perché uno dei limiti che si può riscontrare è legato allo scarso utilizzo dei finanziamenti presenti in alcuni settori, ciò è dovuto a mille motivi, alcuni dei quali proverò a spiegarli. Nell'attività di ricerca e sviluppo, il pacchetto legislativo Horizon 2020 mette a disposizione circa 80 miliardi di euro per il periodo 2014-2020 con l'obiettivo di raggiungere il 3 per cento del <PARTY>L entro il 2020 e di potenziare la competitività globale del sistema Europa. Quello delle politiche ambientali ed energetiche è un altro dei settori molto importanti su cui si è lavorato e anche questo Parlamento sta ponendo una grande attenzione, per promuovere in sede europea la transizione verso un'economia verde e l'adozione, nel perseguimento di politiche ambientali, di un approccio integrato con aspetti sociali ed economici, quindi non più a compartimenti stagni ma secondo un ragionamento più complesso che utilizza sostanzialmente tre pilastri di riferimento (obiettivi al 2020 emissioni al 2050, migliorare la legislazione ambientale e transizione verso un'economia verde), dando priorità al raggiungimento di un mercato unico dell'energia per riuscire quindi ad avere lo stesso trattamento tra regolazione di fonti rinnovabili e tradizionali. Mi avvio a concludere sul tema delle politiche di coesione, su cui c'è un grande lavoro ma su cui si rileva anche un neo. Alla fine del 2011 è stato adottato un piano di azione e coesione rafforzato nel dicembre 2012 con altre due fasi. Esso ha riprogrammato 3,5 miliardi di euro di fondi strutturali gestiti dalle Regioni su quattro priorità: istruzione e formazione, occupazione, infrastrutture ferroviarie, agenda digitale. Successivamente, a dicembre, sono state riconfermate e varate due fasi che mettono a disposizione 2,9 miliardi, la prima, e 5,7 miliardi, l'altra, per materie legate a inclusione sociale, crescita e competitività, con l'attenzione al peggioramento della situazione giovanile (sappiamo infatti quanto anche il premier Letta abbia posto l'accento e stia lavorando su questo), anche per aiutare le imprese e il lavoro. A tale riguardo dobbiamo tuttavia rilevare uno scarso accesso a questi fondi, a fronte invece di una contribuzione importante al bilancio europeo. Ciò è dovuto in parte all'eccessiva burocratizzazione, in parte al tema connesso al Patto di stabilità interno (oggi abbiamo letto una notizia positiva in tal senso), sul quale va a gravare il cofinanziamento delle Regioni e degli enti, e in parte alla difficoltà anche nella formazione e nella capacità di progettare. Quindi su questo punto vi è anche un invito a migliorare. Nella relazione consuntiva troverete inoltre tutti gli allegati che forniscono indicazioni molto particolareggiate.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5442140102386475, 0.45578593015670776]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> LA RUSSA (<PARTY>).

Sì, esattamente. Per quanto riguarda la questione della doppia soglia, il Governo ci fa presente che la direttiva dell'Unione europea non indica in modo chiaro se sia possibile. In uno Stato liberale, tutto quello che non è chiaramente vietato è possibile: siamo in uno Stato liberale, per noi vige questa regola. Il Governo stesso riconosce che in alcuni Paesi - non minori, mi permetto di aggiungere - esiste una doppia soglia per l'OPA obbligatoria, analoga a quella che propone la mozione di cui sono primo firmatario. Quindi, il punto è se, considerando la particolare natura del nostro Paese, del suo sistema di impresa, della sua Borsa e quant'altro, sia adatto al nostro Paese avere il regime dell'OPA obbligatorio oppure avere, per esempio, il regime che vige nella City di Londra. Credo che la struttura dell'Italia sia molto diversa da quella del Regno Unito - migliore per certi aspetti, peggiore per altri - e che quindi il sistema della doppia soglia intercetti meglio l'obiettivo che abbiamo, cioè la tutela del risparmio. Il Governo, quando affronta il tema del controllo di fatto, dice che un sistema basato sull'accertamento del controllo di fatto potrebbe rendere più incerto il mercato del controllo societario. Non sappiamo cosa voglia dire essere certo o incerto; abbiamo l'esperienza di tante vicende ultime in cui... PRESIDENTE.

Per farla breve, credo che il parere del Governo circa la lettera b) del punto 1, per la quale si rimette all'Assemblea, sia quanto mai opportuno, e lo condividiamo. Per quanto riguarda il tema della decretazione d'urgenza, riteniamo che, considerato il caso specifico da cui prende le mosse questa norma di carattere generale, debba essere mantenuto l'invito ad adottare un apposito decreto-legge, a meno che non ci siano altri veicoli legislativi ancora più rapidi; ma non vorremmo che invece andassimo per le lunghe. Quanto all'ultima osservazione, relativamente al termine di trenta giorni di cui al punto 2) del dispositivo, credo che possiamo accogliere l'invito a sostituirlo con le parole: «con la massima urgenza», ma vorremmo che il sottosegretario De Camillis facesse presente che la massima urgenza deve essere realmente tale. Quindi, se i giorni non sono trenta ma trentacinque, va bene, ma se diventano centoventi e si va oltre gennaio, no. Vorrei che questo punto fosse ben chiaro.

Infatti, questa revisione ci vedrà impegnati sia su questo provvedimento, che riguarda gli enti territoriali, che sul disegno di legge approvato dalla Camera e ora all\\'esame della Commissione bilancio, che procede a un aggiornamento anche della legge di contabilità e finanza pubblica. <p> In sostanza, le norme che andiamo ora a ritoccare si propongono di consentire alle Regioni e ai Comuni, anche attraverso un rafforzamento dei patti regionalizzati, di utilizzare gli avanzi di bilancio, ma anche di ricorrere all\\'indebitamento, affrancando risorse importanti per gli investimenti. <p> Gli obblighi europei, la legge costituzionale e poi la legge rinforzata, che - lo hanno già ricordato i colleghi - è una legge ordinaria molto particolare, in virtù della maggioranza assoluta necessaria per la sua approvazione, hanno posto precisi vincoli agli equilibri di bilancio. <p> Ora si prevede che i bilanci degli enti territoriali (Regioni, Province autonome, Province, Città metropolitane e Comuni) siano da considerare in equilibrio quando conseguono un saldo non negativo, in termini di competenza, tra le entrate finali e le spese finali, sia nella fase di previsione che in quella di rendiconto. Si riducono, quindi, i vincoli sui bilanci, ma rimane, comunque, un controllo preventivo e consuntivo sul saldo finale di competenza. <p> Viene previsto che il fondo pluriennale vincolato, destinato alle spese in conto capitale, possa facilitare la programmazione delle spese sul territorio, favorendone un\\'integrazione, che porti a un livello maggiore di investimenti. <p> Per gli enti del territorio si manifesta la possibilità di riclassificare l\\'eventuale indebitamento in quote costanti, divise in tre anni. <p> Va registrato anche il tentativo di un cambio di mentalità, in questo disegno di legge, nel modo di affrontare i problemi dei livelli di governo del territorio, perché, finalmente, nei confronti degli enti del territorio vengono introdotti anche dei premi e non solamente delle sanzioni, come è stato finora, tra l\\'altro con un meccanismo apprezzabile come quello inserito durante i lavori della Commissione bilancio. <p> Probabilmente si è preso atto che i livelli di governo più vicini alla gente hanno subito troppe penalizzazioni e sono quelli che negli ultimi anni hanno pagato il prezzo più alto all\\'equilibrio dei conti pubblici. <p> Troppi sono stati i sacrifici immolati in nome dei saldi di bilancio e troppe le coperture finanziarie ricavate attraverso tagli ai trasferimenti a Comuni, Province e Regioni, utilizzate in sede di leggi di spesa, fossero esse leggi finanziarie o uno dei tanti decreti legge nati con l\\'intento di \"salvare\" l\\'Italia. <p> Sbagliata si è rivelata anche l\\'idea di utilizzare lo strumento dell\\'imposizione fiscale comunale per destinarla - per oltre il 40 per cento delle risorse complessive - alla perequazione orizzontale nei confronti degli altri enti locali. <p> Va sottolineato, inoltre, che le sole regole relative al Patto di stabilità interno e alla nuova contabilità hanno prodotto tagli sui bilanci comunali per oltre 3 miliardi di euro nell\\'ultimo quinquennio. <p> La realtà è che i cittadini non possono davvero fare a meno dei servizi resi sul territorio alla collettività, perché sono quelli materialmente più vicini ai loro bisogni. <p> Il sacrificio - voglio ricordarlo - è stato pesante, riuscendo a ridurre le risorse totali a disposizione dei Comuni (scese negli ultimi cinque anni di 3,8 miliardi, negli 8.000 Comuni) e ad abbattere il volume degli investimenti sui loro territori (calati del 25 per cento nello stesso periodo). <p> Le Province, con le poche risorse rimaste, non riescono nemmeno a far fronte alle funzioni essenziali individuate dalla legge Delrio, che, sostanzialmente, le ha svuotate di competenze. Ma, tra queste competenze ce ne sono - ad esempio - due sulle quali il taglio ha un impatto importante. <p> Il primo esempio che vorrei fare è la manutenzione delle strade: vediamo ogni giorno, nelle nostre ex Province, come è ridotto il manto delle strade controllate (130.000 chilometri di competenza). <p> Il secondo esempio riguarda le scuole superiori: 5.000 in tutta Italia, sempre più fatiscenti, dove l\\'allarme per i crolli di intonaci o controsoffitti è ricorrente. Ed è veramente triste pensare che anche la solidità di un edificio scolastico è diventata uno dei parametri da considerare per la scelta della scuola da fare frequentare ai nostri figli. Come è altrettanto triste pensare che i genitori debbano provvedere ad autotassarsi per comprare beni di primaria utilità. <p> Ebbene, a causa dei tagli, quest\\'anno le Province registreranno un disavanzo strutturale di oltre un miliardo di euro. <p> Persino le Regioni, la cui funzione fondamentale dovrebbe essere quella di garantire standard di servizi qualitativamente omogenei, come - ad esempio - nel primario settore della sanità, continuano ad avere dei bilanci in sofferenza. Sappiamo tutti che, purtroppo, anche loro hanno pagato un prezzo importante in nome delle manovre di finanza pubblica. Le stesse Regioni ora vivono in un limbo sino alla celebrazione del referendum costituzionale che, qualora venisse approvato, le relegherebbe a competenze marginali, essendo stata ridotta - come sappiamo - la loro potestà in conseguenza della riscrittura del Titolo V della Costituzione. Al contrario, servono risorse economiche e, sopratutto, è necessaria una programmazione pluriennale della spesa che faccia ripartire gli investimenti. È ormai fondamentale la creazione di un nuovo quadro di finanza pubblica locale che coinvolga e responsabilizzi pienamente tutti i livelli di governo del territorio. È fondamentale tornare a un quadro di risorse proprie che possa garantire un livello di entrate tale da assicurare i livelli essenziali dei servizi e delle prestazioni resi su ciascun territorio. In cambio, lo Stato deve però ridurre il peso del prelievo fiscale centrale. Al contrario, leggiamo che gli unici dati certamente positivi che arrivano sull\\'operato di questo Governo sono quelli relativi all\\'andamento delle entrate, che registrano le tasse a carico degli italiani in continuo aumento, nonostante il sostanziale stallo del <PARTY>L. Purtroppo, anche la nuova articolazione delle leggi di contabilità che riguardano gli enti territoriali fa permanere quella incertezza dovuta a un quadro di programmazione annuale (quindi basato su un periodo troppo breve), che dipende dalle leggi annuali di bilancio e dalle conseguenti scelte di finanza derivata. Oltretutto, in questo momento, essa risente anche degli errori nelle scelte di politica economica commessi negli ultimi anni e delle troppe cambiali.

Addirittura c'è chi propone di riportare la gestione dell'agricoltura a livello nazionale. Di per sé, la Commissione sembra intenzionata a proseguire nel percorso avviato sin dal 1962, tant'è che il presidente Juncker ha detto che le parole chiave del futuro in agricoltura sono «semplificazione» e «ammodernamento», mentre il commissario Hogan ha precisato che la PAC dovrà garantire alcune regole base per «assicurare una maggiore resilienza dei mercati, una produzione agricola più sostenibile e un migliore ricambio generazionale». D'altra parte, la PAC è stata una delle principali politiche del mercato comune europeo e ha permesso di conseguire l'indipendenza alimentare del nostro continente. Un traguardo che molto spesso si dà per scontato ma che, in realtà, così scontato non è. Peraltro, sebbene essa conti meno del 2 per cento del <PARTY>L e del 5 per cento dell'occupazione dell'intera Unione europea, va sottolineato che si tratta, in termini assoluti, di un settore che interessa circa 22 milioni di agricoltori e crea 44 milioni di posti di lavoro. Sono molti i fattori che possono incidere sulle scelte da assumere per la definizione del nuovo programma relativo agli anni 2020-2026. Due, in particolare, meritano, a mio avviso, di essere tenuti in considerazione: da una parte l'uscita del Regno Unito dall'Unione; dall'altra, le scelte di politica economica dell'amministrazione americana. Al momento, è verosimile che la PAC non subisca un drastico ridimensionamento, ma è realistico attendersi una diminuzione delle risorse assegnate e una conseguente riduzione rispetto al recente passato, degli obiettivi e degli strumenti. Qui entra in gioco l'uscita del Regno Unito dall'Unione europea. Al di là del lungo percorso e delle ripercussioni che avrà sull'intero processo di integrazione europea, l'uscita del Regno Unito avrà certamente l'effetto di mutare gli equilibri del bilancio comunitario. Dall'altro lato e nel contempo, però, l'assenza del Regno Unito gioca a favore del mantenimento della Politica agricola comune, dal momento che i britannici prediligono un approccio marcatamente liberista e quindi contrario sia all'intervento di sostegno e di regolazione dei prezzi, sia alle politiche di tutela della qualità e dell'origine, viste da loro come un vulnus ai meccanismi del libero mercato. Potenzialmente determinanti per il futuro della Politica agricola comune saranno, poi, le scelte di politica economica assunte dall'amministrazione americana di Trump, che non ha mai fatto mistero delle sue idee protezionistiche. Un ritorno a politiche di stampo protezionistico non sarebbe sicuramente positivo per il nostro Paese, in ragione del ruolo che da sempre svolge il settore agroalimentare nel quadro della nostra bilancia commerciale. L' export agricolo è stato determinante, tanto da fungere da traino negli anni della crisi, grazie al fatto che il settore ha dimostrato una forte competitività nei prodotti di alta qualità. Il protezionismo non sarebbe positivo neanche per i possibili effetti che avrebbe sul mercato interno. È vero che i dazi doganali rendono più costose le importazioni - a tutto vantaggio della produzione nostrana - ma sortiscono effetti analoghi anche per i nostri prodotti, la cui penetrazione nei mercati esteri sarebbe a questo punto ostacolata. Nel complesso, l'impressione generale è che da queste scelte la bilancia commerciale sarebbe fortemente penalizzata. In un siffatto contesto politico ed economico appare di tutta evidenza la necessità di intervenire sul settore agricolo con interventi ben mirati. La riforma della Politica agricola comune deve rispondere, oggi più che mai, alle nuove sfide che il recente panorama comunitario e internazionale ci chiamano ad affrontare. L'Unione europea, con misure che sappiano valorizzare la distintività territoriale delle produzioni, deve premiare l'occupazione delle aree rurali escludendo insostenibili rendite e puntando, al contrario, ad un sistema di premialità qualitativa. L'obiettivo è quello di assicurare al Paese una piena fruizione delle opportunità di sostegno al settore agroalimentare offerte dalla Politica agricola comune, con particolare riferimento alla componente greening introdotta quale sistema premiale, in aggiunta al premio base diretto, per il servizio ecologico migliorativo compiuto dall'operatore del settore. Come intervenire, dunque? Quali sono le priorità? Il tempo a mia disposizione sta per terminare, quindi provo a fare un breve elenco degli obiettivi che, a mio avviso, occorre raggiungere. Innanzitutto è necessario rafforzare tutte le misure che escludono la rendita dai benefici di Politica agricola comune, premiando di contro la capacità imprenditoriale e innovativa, al fine di ottenere alti standard qualitativi dei prodotti e delle aziende produttrici per riacquistare appetibilità sui mercati internazionali. Occorre poi implementare le produzioni di eccellenza agroalimentari nazionali sostenendo e tutelando la distintività dei prodotti made in Italy. Occorre creare un diffuso sistema di coordinamento di schemi specifici in ambito agro ambientale valorizzando così le peculiarità dei singoli territori e consentendo la cooperazione e l'aggregazione di imprese, per favorire l'accesso alle misure di sostegno a tutti gli operatori coinvolti, molti nel nostro Paese di piccole dimensioni. Infine, occorre promuovere il ricambio generazionale - è una battaglia che stiamo sostenendo da tempo - mediante l'accesso a specifiche misure di sostegno all'imprenditoria innovativa condotta da giovani e dalle donne imprenditrici agricole. Da ultimo, occorre snellire il sistema dei pagamenti diretti, in particolare quelli concernenti il premio greening, rivelatosi in questi anni poco incisivo e di difficile attuazione, per via di un macchinoso sistema burocratico e di restrittivi criteri selettivi. Spero che questa sia la direzione che riusciremo a seguire e a sostenere.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5189159512519836, 0.48108401894569397]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> AUGUSSORI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, vorrei fare una breve dichiarazione di voto sull'emendamento 1.12 per spiegarne la motivazione ed invitare i colleghi ad una riflessione.

Chiediamo che questi tre dirigenti vengano destinati ad attuare le politiche e le sinergie di coordinamento tra i vari Dicasteri, quindi non solo quello delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali, non solo quello del Mibac, ma anche quello del territorio e dell'ambiente.

Signora Presidente, cari colleghe e colleghi, il 10 giugno del 1924 il deputato e segretario del Partito socialista Matteotti esce di casa a piedi per dirigersi verso Montecitorio. Sul lungotevere, ad attenderlo, è ferma un auto con a bordo alcuni individui, che lo spingono in auto, rapendolo. Il rapimento prima e l'assassinio poi di Matteotti hanno segnato in modo indelebile la storia politica e istituzionale del nostro Paese. A partire da quella data, il fascismo stringe le maglie, mette progressivamente al bando la libertà di pensiero e la libertà di associazione e inizia a farsi regime, segnando l'inizio del periodo più buio della storia dell'Italia. I sei articoli del disegno di legge per le celebrazioni del centesimo anniversario della morte di Giacomo Matteotti rappresentano dunque un doveroso omaggio non solo ai valori personali che Matteotti pagò a caro prezzo con il bene più prezioso, la vita, ma anche ai valori della libertà di pensiero e di espressione. Facciamone tesoro: oggi questa libertà è messa spesso in discussione. Giacomo Matteotti - come tutti sappiamo - non morì affatto invano; lo dimostra non solo questo disegno di legge, ma soprattutto la memoria collettiva nazionale. Il compito del legislatore, a cento anni dalla sua prematura scomparsa, è di incrementare il sostegno pubblico a questa memoria collettiva e di sostenerla in ogni forma, in modo da rendere sempre più partecipi e consapevoli di ciò che accade soprattutto i giovani e l'intera società civile. Sì, i giovani, con l'acquisizione della consapevolezza, possano essere liberi di scegliere e partecipare attivamente alla vita sociale. Le iniziative presenti in questa proposta legislativa rappresentano un buon viatico da seguire. L'incessante azione politica intrapresa da Matteotti contro la dittatura rappresenta, ora come allora, tutti noi. L'approvazione nei vari passaggi istituzionali di questo disegno di legge, che promuove e valorizza la conoscenza e lo studio delle opere e del pensiero di Matteotti, rappresenta un segnale forte di unità, che ribadisce ancora una volta come la nostra Repubblica condanni inesorabilmente e fermamente il regime fascista e tutti i soprusi che furono commessi in quel ventennio. Matteotti rappresenta un simbolo indelebile della lotta al fascismo e alla corruzione nel regime mussoliniano e rappresenta l'onore degli italiani liberi che furono trucidati e incarcerati in nome della libertà e dell'antifascismo. Per tutto ciò che rappresenta il compianto deputato e segretario socialista e in nome del suo sacrificio, annuncio dunque il voto favorevole del nostro Gruppo a questo disegno di legge.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5049386024475098, 0.4950614273548126]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> CIRIANI (<PARTY>). Signor Presidente, naturalmente ho partecipato alla Conferenza dei Capigruppo e ho ascoltato le rimostranze del senatore Romeo. Noi abbiamo chiesto di avere un tempo sufficiente per poter affrontare la questione del senatore Salvini. Un'accelerazione dei tempi - secondo noi - era inopportuna oltre che sconveniente dal punto di vista politico, perché si tratta comunque di discutere di una questione molto delicata che riguarda l'attività politica e la libertà di espressione, di pensiero e di azione di un Ministro della Repubblica, che richiede più tempo non per essere rinviata all'infinito, ma per essere esaminata. Ribadisco anche qui in Aula quello che ho detto nella Conferenza dei Capigruppo riguardo allo scostamento di bilancio. Il ministro D'Incà ieri ha riferito - cosa che peraltro avevamo anche letto sui giornali - che il Governo ha intenzione di proporre uno scostamento quantificabile in un punto di <PARTY>L o forse qualcosa di più, equivalente a 15-20 miliardi di euro. Noi, Presidente, colleghi, abbiamo sempre votato gli scostamenti; sappiamo che hanno bisogno di una maggioranza qualificata; abbiamo garantito il nostro voto, che è stato determinante in passato; abbiamo votato a scatola chiusa, affidando poi al Governo il compito di distribuire le risorse. Il bilancio di questo atto di fiducia è per noi estremamente negativo. Quindi, questa volta chiediamo semplicemente al Governo e alla maggioranza di dirci prima come intenda utilizzare i 15-20 miliardi di scostamento che il Senato e la Camera dei Deputati dovranno votare da qui a pochi giorni. Non ci pare una richiesta strana, stravagante o lunare. Ci pare una richiesta di responsabilità, di condivisione delle responsabilità in un momento drammatico per la vita del Paese. Spesso il Presidente del Consiglio ci ha accusati di non voler dialogare con lui. Noi ribaltiamo questa logica: gli offriamo la possibilità di dialogare sullo scostamento, sulle cifre ipotizzate. Vogliamo semplicemente conoscere almeno le macrovoci su cui il Governo intende agire per spendere i 20 miliardi o quanti saranno, che faranno ballare alla fine lo scostamento complessivo rispetto ai piani al Governo per circa 100 miliardi di euro. Il nostro, quindi, è un atto politico. Le risposte non possono essere di ordine regolamentare, come abbiamo sentito ieri dal Ministro, e ci aspettiamo una risposta politica.

Oggi ci troviamo ad illustrare nuovamente il disegno di legge di stabilità e il disegno di legge di bilancio a distanza di un mese e in un quadro parzialmente mutato sia sotto il profilo economico che politico internazionale. <p> In questo mese, la Camera dei deputati ha approvato in seconda lettura entrambi i disegni di legge che ora passano al vaglio del Senato per la sua seconda lettura e per il via libera definitivo. <p> Colgo l\\'occasione per ringraziare non in modo non formale il personale degli Uffici del Senato, in particolare quello della Commissione bilancio, per la disponibilità e la serietà del lavoro svolto. Ringrazio ovviamente i senatori della maggioranza, ma anche dell\\'opposizione che, pur presentando un numero elevato di emendamenti, ne hanno consentito un esame rapido concentrandosi solo su quelli che ritenevano prioritari. Tutto ciò ha consentito ieri sera di votare positivamente il mandato alle relatrici; di questo ringrazio, in modo non formale, il presidente Tonini per averci creduto. <p> Passiamo ora ad esaminare le modifiche introdotte alla Camera per tematiche generali. Spetta a me esaminare i seguenti temi: entrate e politiche fiscali, misure per gli enti locali, investimenti pubblici, misure per il lavoro e la previdenza. Mentre, dopo di me, l\\'altra relatrice illustrerà i seguenti temi: banche, pacchetto sicurezza e cultura, imprese e Mezzogiorno, sanità e altri interventi. <p> In estrema sintesi, perché ciascuno di noi ha avuto la possibilità di analizzare i documenti, ricordo che sulle entrate e politiche fiscali alla Camera è stata sospesa l\\'efficacia delle leggi regionali e delle deliberazioni comunali per la parte in cui aumentano i tributi e le addizionali attribuite ai medesimi enti territoriali, in luogo di vietare la deliberazione di tali aumenti (come invece previsto dalla norma originaria). Sempre in materia fiscale ricordo: la riduzione dell\\'aliquota IRES dal 27,5 al 24 per cento, confermata dal 2017. <p> Tra le novità introdotte nel corso dell\\'esame alla Camera segnalo: l\\'assimilazione ai redditi di lavoro dipendente del reddito dei soci delle cooperative artigiane che hanno un rapporto di lavoro in forma autonoma, fermo restando il loro trattamento previdenziale. <p> Segnalo inoltre la proroga al 2016 delle norme che consentono la compensazione delle cartelle esattoriali in favore delle imprese titolari di crediti commerciali e professionali non prescritti, certi, liquidi ed esigibili, maturati nei confronti della pubblica amministrazione. Sono molti altri gli interventi previsti, che chi vorrà potrà esaminare nel testo della relazione, che consegnerò affinché venga allegata agli atti. Voglio solo ricordare, a proposito della fiscalità immobiliare, che nella lettura alla Camera dei deputati sono state introdotte alcune misure in merito agli immobili dati in comodato d\\'uso ai figli e ai genitori, introducendo una riduzione del 50 per cento della base imponibile IMU. La riduzione dell\\'IMU è prevista per la seconda abitazione data in comodato al figlio, nel territorio ricompreso all\\'interno del Comune di residenza anche del genitore. <p> Tra le altre misure, sempre a proposito della fiscalità immobiliare, dove l\\'attenzione sia del Senato che della Camera dei deputati si è concentrata per agevolare in modo particolare la tematica degli affitti, voglio ricordare che, anche a seguito dell\\'ordine del giorno approvato in Senato, con parere favorevole del Governo, la Camera dei deputati ha approvato la misura del canone di locazione dovuto ai conduttori che avevano beneficiato della determinazione di legge, per mancata o parziale registrazione del contratto - la cosiddetta emersione del nero negli affitti - che è pari al triplo della rendita catastale. In questo modo si è prevista una misura importante proprio a vantaggio dei cittadini che hanno avuto il coraggio di denunciare il nero in questo settore. <p> Passo dunque ad illustrare le misure previste per gli enti locali. Il pacchetto di misure per gli enti locali è davvero nutrito: sebbene la scorsa estate sia già stato approvato un decreto-legge specifico in materia di enti locali, la legge di stabilità ha ritenuto di dover fare ancora numerosi interventi, a mio avviso estremamente utili, in favore di questi enti. Uno dei punti più qualificanti è proprio la parte che riguarda la galassia dei Comuni e delle Province - ora enti di area vasta - e delle città metropolitane, che dal 2008 al 2014 hanno sopportato una parte rilevantissima dello sforzo di risanamento dei conti pubblici. L\\'ammontare cumulato al 2015 delle varie manovre che si sono susseguite vale 19,3 miliardi di euro, pari al 25 per cento della spesa totale di tali enti. Quindi, l\\'apporto alla riduzione della spesa pubblica è stato davvero rilevante. Sul sistema degli enti locali, in particolare, siamo partiti da una condizione di grande difficoltà, dovuta anche alle leggi di stabilità dei periodi precedenti. I Comuni potevano dirsi soddisfatti dell\\'intervento, che per la prima volta riconosce loro il ristoro completo dell\\'abolizione dell\\'IMU, ma la legge di stabilità per il 2016 segna un vero punto di svolta per gli enti locali del nostro Paese: per la prima volta non sono previsti tagli ai trasferimenti, né inasprimenti dei vincoli di finanza pubblica e, anzi, nel 2016 finisce l\\'era del patto interno di stabilità e si passa al principio più razionale dell\\'equilibrio di bilancio sulla competenza rafforzata. Alla Camera dei deputati si è intervenuti in modo rilevante sulla copertura e sulla limitazione dei tagli per le Province, che era un tema fortemente sottolineato in Senato, sia durante l\\'esame in Commissione, sia negli interventi svolti in Assemblea, così come si è intervenuti fortemente sul tema delle Regioni. Anche in questo caso, per chi è interessato, lascio agli atti il testo scritto della relazione, che approfondisce questi temi. <p> Voglio riservare ancora due parole al tema degli investimenti pubblici: per quanto riguarda gli investimenti pubblici, oltre alle misure di accelerazione della spesa dei fondi europei e all\\'utilizzo della clausola per investimenti, che vale lo 0,3 per cento del <PARTY>L, quindi un po\\' meno di 5 miliardi di euro, con un effetto leva di spesa complessiva \"liberata\" per 11,8 miliardi nel corso del 2016, in particolare nelle aree del Mezzogiorno, le novità in fatto di investimenti pubblici hanno lo stesso segno positivo che contraddistingue la manovra nel suo complesso. <p> Si rafforza anche la strada verso una prima forma di autonomia finanziaria dell\\'ANAS. Si consolidano, intanto, le novità che fin dall\\'inizio sono entrate nella manovra: crescono per la prima volta, dopo sette, otto anni, gli stanziamenti in favore del settore infrastrutturale; i fondi per ANAS e Ferrovie dello Stato sono comunque stabilizzati per il triennio; si supera (almeno parzialmente) il patto di stabilità interno per i Comuni che aveva frenato pesantemente gli investimenti locali degli ultimi cinque anni. <p> Sulle misure per il lavoro e la previdenza, voglio ricordare che in questa legge di stabilità è stato previsto l\\'anticipo dal 2017 al 2016 della no tax area per i pensionati. Questa è un\\'iniziativa forte e riguarda circa 6 milioni di cittadini che hanno un reddito da pensione fino a 8.000 euro. È previsto anche il prolungamento a tutto il 2016 delle tutele in caso di disoccupazione per i lavoratori precari, la cosiddetta DIS-COLL. La norma scadeva quest\\'anno e si tratta di un intervento a difesa dei lavoratori più deboli. Viene riconosciuta l\\'inclusione dei periodi di maternità ai fini del conteggio dei premi di produttività aziendali. Questa manovra, sommata alle altre misure che avevamo preso in Senato, dimostra un\\'attenzione a tutta la fascia delle lavoratrici che affrontano il tema della maternità. Mi fermo qui, ma chiedo di consegnare alla Presidenza il testo completo della mia relazione. Lascio la parola alla relatrice Chiavaroli che ringrazio particolarmente per il lavoro svolto insieme con serietà e impegno, ma anche con affetto e stima reciproca. <p> Ha facoltà di parlare la relatrice, senatrice Chiavaroli.', 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.5516682863235474, 0.448331743478775]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> LO GIUDICE (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, con questo intervento continuo oggi una staffetta con cui, assieme a tante senatrici e tanti senatori, ricordiamo ogni donna che viene uccisa per mano di un uomo a cui è o è stata legata da relazione amorosa. Lo faremo fino a che sarà necessario ricordare al Parlamento e al nostro Paese l'urgenza di arginare la violenza nei confronti delle donne. Nella notte fra il 23 e il 24 dicembre, a Bee, in provincia di Verbania, Alessia Partesana, ventinove anni, è stata uccisa dal suo compagno a coltellate. <p> «Lei voleva lasciarmi e io non riuscivo a sopportarlo»: è quanto ha dichiarato l'omicida. La coppia aveva una bambina di cinque anni. <p> Nella notte fra il 26 e il 27 dicembre, a Parma, Gabriella Altamirano, di quarantacinque anni, è stata uccisa a coltellate, assieme a Kelly Manici, transessuale e drag queen, dal compagno, che aveva lasciato dopo che lui stesso l'aveva avviata alla prostituzione vivendo dei proventi di quell'attività. Gabriella lo aveva più volte denunciato per atti persecutori e più volte aveva chiamato il 112 perché lui si appostava sotto casa. Salgono così a 33 le donne che ricordiamo in questa staffetta, iniziata solo il 30 giugno 2016. Molte di loro uccise dopo una separazione, anche solo annunciata. Sempre come reazione ad una recente separazione, si è consumato il 9 gennaio un ulteriore tentativo di femminicidio, a Messina, dove Ylenia Bonavera, di ventidue anni, è stata data alle fiamme dal suo ragazzo ed è ora in ospedale col corpo devastato dalle ustioni. Ylenia non ha denunciato il suo compagno, che anzi ha cercato di scagionare nonostante le prove schiaccianti. Uno schema purtroppo assai consueto, lo stesso per cui proprio ieri una ragazza albanese di ventitré anni si è recata al pronto soccorso di Budrio, nell'area metropolitana bolognese, con un polso rotto dal compagno, che però si è rifiutata di denunciare. Secondo L 'ISTAT, In Italia ogni 2,2 giorni viene uccisa una donna. Il 46,3 per cento delle donne uccise muore per mano del partner o dell'ex partner. La gravità delle violenze sessuali e fisiche è aumentata. Sono in crescita anche i casi di violenza assistita, quell'odioso maltrattamento psicologico che consiste nel lasciare che minori assistano ad atti di violenza contro un adulto che, nella gran parte dei casi, è la loro stessa madre. Non si tratta solo di fatti di cronaca. Esistono ragioni culturali profonde della violenza contro le donne e degli atti di femminicidio. Esiste, nel nostro Paese, una questione maschile, intesa come un'incapacità di molti uomini a gestire in modo corretto, paritario e non violento la relazione con l'altro genere. Riproponiamo quindi con convinzione il nostro appello. È un appello al Governo, nell'attesa che sia riassegnata la delega alle pari opportunità: la cabina di regia monitori l'applicazione, i pregi e i limiti della legge n. 119 del 2013 di contrasto alla violenza di genere, approvata da questo Parlamento in attuazione della Convenzione in Istanbul e, soprattutto, dia piena e accurata attuazione al piano contro la violenza. È un appello ai media : si smetta di giustificare, anche solo con un linguaggio sbagliato, gli assassini e di colpevolizzare le donne. È un appello al Paese, uomini e donne: sono 160 le donne uccise ogni anno, non possiamo più accettare questa mattanza.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.597048282623291, 0.402951717376709]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> COMPAGNONE (<PARTY>).

Un'opera che assegna un ruolo centrale all'Italia e qualifica la nostra Penisola quale piattaforma logistica europea protesa verso il bacino del Mediterraneo e verso l'Est. Fondamentali, in questo senso, sono i collegamenti infrastrutturali di Alta velocità e Alta capacità che non possono prescindere dalla realizzazione del ponte sullo Stretto di Messina. La realizzazione del ponte permetterebbe infatti non solo l'ampliamento del mercato con l'intensificazione degli scambi tra imprese e la nascita di nuove occasioni imprenditoriali, ma anche il miglioramento dei collegamenti sia sul breve che sul lungo raggio, la riqualificazione degli attuali sistemi portuali che, alleggeriti dalle funzioni di traghettamento locale, potranno concentrarsi sul mercato crocieristico e diportistico e, infine, un impatto urbanistico positivo con decongestionamento del traffico veicolare e marittimo e conseguente un miglioramento ambientale dovuto alla riduzione dell'inquinamento in atmosfera e nel mare. Oltretutto, il sistema ferroviario siciliano - come è stato detto - è dotato di 1.450 chilometri di rete ferroviaria, di cui solo 753 elettrificati e , soprattutto, soltanto un centinaio di chilometri a doppio binario (appena il 20 per cento dell'intera linea). Sul fronte della rete stradale, invece, è necessario finanziare il completamento dell'itinerario Licodia Eubea-Libertinia.

Con un ragionamento con il quale adesso non vi annoierò, egli sostiene che gli ebrei incarnavano la modernità e la tecnica e sono stati uccisi dalla loro stessa tecnica. Egli appoggia dunque questa idea ed è convinto che l'annientamento è stato voluto dagli stessi ebrei - che, come dicono in tanti, inducendo certamente delle opinioni malsanissime, se lo sono andata a cercare - ma è un filosofo grandissimo, che ci ha detto delle cose enormi sui problemi fondamentali dell'esistenza, dell'individuo e della collettività, sul tempo, la morte e l'essere. Per arrivare a noi, questo non è solo un problema di storia, di dati e di riconoscimento, ma si tratta di una questione più profonda: è proprio la filosofia a dirci la radice di fondo di questo problema, che non a caso torna continuamente. È infatti difficile distinguere le opinioni dalle conseguenze delle opinioni e lo dice un filosofo che è stato protagonista di questa dimensione. <p> Per arrivare a noi e al nostro piccolo, va detto che tutto ciò è molto difficile, tanto che noi, storici e studiosi qui presenti al Senato, che apparteniamo alle comunità scientifiche che studiano questi temi, siamo stati contrarissimi alla precedente versione del disegno di legge e siamo contrarissimi ad una versione che condanni il negazionismo come reato di opinione in sede penale. In questo caso, però, nel testo di legge che stiamo discutendo, questa difficilissima distinzione tra opinione e istigazione, tra fatti e interpretazione dei fatti, tra giudizio e dato di realtà, tra giudizio e conseguenza di questo giudizio, viene risolta in modo sufficientemente efficace - pur con molte ambiguità, perché probabilmente non andrebbe fatta neanche in linea di principio - perché c'è una netta distinzione tra opinione e istigazione, come hanno sostenuto gli interventi di coloro che mi hanno preceduto. <p> L'opinione, infatti, non si può mai reprimere, ma la negazione - e qui veniamo al caso in esame - deve essere stigmatizzata non dalla legge, ma dalla comunità scientifica, perché è un falso storico. Saranno dunque i colleghi accademici e la loro ricerca a dire quanto è falso tutto ciò. Credetemi, la mia non è una spocchia intellettuale in difesa della corporazione, perché siamo profondamente convinti che l'unico modo efficace per combattere davvero una falsità storica sia quello di confutarla iuxta propria principia, con i dati, i documenti e le prove fattuali. Si tratta infatti di un dato scientifico e non di un'opinione e dunque non è punibile sul piano della legge, ma è da condannare sul piano della professione, della comunicazione e della trasmissione. È un fatto vitale dire ai nostri giovani che chi sostiene che tutto ciò non sia accaduto dice una cosa sbagliata, perché non è vero. E che non è sbagliata, perché è la sua opinione: l'opinione è un'altra cosa. Si pensi ad Heidegger, tanto è vero che la comunità scientifica ogni decennio si interroga su questa figura così intrigante, complicata e davvero molto inquietante. Invece la storia ha un suo dato di realtà; un fatto c'è o non c'è: chi lo nega è da stigmatizzare e il suo lavoro scientifico è da condannare. L'istigazione, invece, va punita. Si tratta di un terzo livello: c'è l'opinione, c'è la negazione e, infine, c'è l'istigazione. Questo è quello che persegue il testo al nostro esame, che contiene dei miglioramenti decisivi: è stato detto anche dal senatore Malan che nel testo assolutamente non si prevede un reato di opinione, ma solo un aggravante all'articolo 3 della cosiddetta legge Reale-Mancino, nel caso di un'istigazione che sia però conclamata, pubblica, verificabile e che abbia delle conseguenze. Quindi, voteremo il testo con convinzione, pur con le perplessità che ho detto prima e che abbiamo sempre sostenuto. Concludo precisando che restiamo convinti - parlo anche a nome di altri storici, ma di certo ne sono personalmente convinta - che non si possa mai incriminare un'opinione, ma che anche la stessa libertà di espressione - si veda il caso « Je suis Charlie » - abbia dei limiti. Persino la libertà di espressione ha dei limiti, che, come diceva bene il senatore Manconi, stanno nel rispetto delle opinioni e delle persone, delle convinzioni e delle religioni altrui. Quindi restiamo decisamente contrari a incriminare persino il falso storico: vorrei rassicurare i senatori Scilipoti Isgrò e Giovanardi. Qui non si tratta di mettere in galera gli storici De Felice e Nolte, perché Ernst Nolte, che è colui che di più si è misurato con il tema della Shoah (e non solo con il fascismo), non ha mai negato l'esistenza. Qui entriamo in tutto un altro campo, che è quello revisionista, che dice: cerchiamo di capire perché è successo. Nolte si è domandato questo: perché è successo. Quindi, questo lo lasciamo agli storici. Con queste precisazioni, confermo il ringraziamento al lavoro fatto dalla Commissione e dalla relatrice e preannuncio che voteremo a favore di questo nuovo testo del provvedimento.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.521781861782074, 0.4782181680202484]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, ci stiamo occupando della conversione in legge del decreto-legge riguardante le misure urgenti per contrastare gli effetti economici e umanitari della crisi in Ucraina. <p> Per fronteggiare questa crisi internazionale vengono introdotte dal decreto-legge in esame una serie di disposizioni per far fronte alle eccezionali esigenze, in particolare in ordine allo svolgimento delle attività produttive, per contenere i prezzi dell'energia sul mercato italiano e fronteggiare la situazione di instabilità nel funzionamento del sistema nazionale di gas naturale derivante dal conflitto russo-ucraino. <p> Nonostante il lavoro in Commissione sia stato molto intenso, faticoso e corposo, sono stati prodotti più di 1.421 emendamenti da parte di tutti i Gruppi parlamentari e la Lega si ritiene soddisfatta, anche se non del tutto, perché si può fare sempre di più. Il lavoro del nostro Gruppo è stato forte e importante su tutta una serie di temi. Siamo un po' rammaricati da piccoli segnali che il Governo forse ci avrebbe potuto dare su situazioni che sembrano piccole a noi, ma sono grandi per i vari settori. Mi riferisco - ad esempio - all'emendamento che stanziava piccolissimi fondi per i centri riabilitativi per i diversamente abili dotati di piscine riscaldate, utilizzate per fisioterapia e riabilitazione in acqua; vi era poi un nostro emendamento contro il taglio dei militari, che è stato bocciato, previo parere negativo da parte del Governo. La riduzione prevista dal prossimo 1° luglio di altre 1.000 unità dall'operazione Strade sicure è un grave danno per il nostro Paese. Come Lega continueremo a batterci per le Forze dell'ordine e per l'incolumità degli italiani. <p> Inoltre, il Governo poteva accogliere il nostro emendamento sugli extraprofitti a banche. Avevamo chiesto con forza di ampliare la platea dei soggetti chiamati a versare il contributo straordinario contro il caro bollette. Occorreva un atto concreto di redistribuzione sociale, innalzando la tassazione degli extraprofitti dal 10 al 25 per cento ed estendendola anche alle banche e agli intermediari finanziari che operano nel settore dell'energia. Se il nostro emendamento fosse stato approvato e accolto dal Governo, avrebbe garantito delle entrate allo Stato e, di conseguenza, la distribuzione di profitti a milioni di italiani, ma anche di coprire gli oneri per rimuovere gli effetti distorsivi contenuti nella norma che penalizzano diverse imprese. Sarebbe stato un gesto di giustizia sociale, una misura equa e necessaria, per contenere i costi del caro energia e aiutare famiglia ed imprese. <p> È anche vero però che sono arrivati altri piccoli, grandi segnali: grazie al lavoro fatto dal Gruppo Lega con il resto della maggioranza e all'insistenza del nostro partito, sono stati accolti emendamenti che in questo momento di grave crisi post pandemica aiutano realmente i nostri cittadini. Mi riferisco in particolar modo - ringrazio Giorgio Bergesio e il Gruppo - alla rateizzazione del pagamento delle multe derivanti dalle quote latte, importantissimo provvedimento. Inoltre, ci possiamo ritenere soddisfatti per l'approvazione dell'emendamento in difesa delle nostre aziende per quanto riguarda le esportazioni dei rottami, con cui viene ampliato il numero dei soggetti obbligati a trasmettere l'informativa di esportazione al Ministero dello sviluppo economico, che potrà effettuare un monitoraggio chiaro per tutte le imprese che vogliono esportare, incluse quelle estere. Questa è un'iniziativa che serve per tutelare le nostre realtà produttive da pratiche di mercato scorrette che metterebbero in seria difficoltà interi settori, dall'edilizia alle acciaierie, con conseguenze pesanti per le nostre imprese e ricadute sociali e occupazionali. Un'altra risposta concreta agli imprenditori che faticano ancora a riprendersi dall'emergenza sanitaria ed economica e che ci chiedono con forza di non essere lasciati soli nella ripartenza post pandemica è l'approvazione dell'emendamento che permette - per esempio - ai bar, ai ristoranti e ai pubblici esercizi in generale, già ritenuti idonei, a continuare, previo pagamento, a usufruire di tavoli e sedie all'aperto per tutta la stagione estiva, senza dover produrre alcuna nuova richiesta e senza che le amministrazioni comunali possano negarlo. Questo servirà anche per alleggerire le stesse amministrazioni comunali, oltre che per lo sviluppo delle nostre attività. Siamo orgogliosi di questi e di tantissimi altri risultati, frutto di trattative con la maggioranza di Governo, sulla quale sono certo non avremmo potuto incidere restando all'opposizione. Presidente, vorrei concludere questo mio intervento su una questione che da cittadino pugliese mi interessa direttamente e mi sta a cuore, che riguarda l'ex Ilva. Non è possibile - lo dico ai compagni di questo percorso di Governo di larghe intese - che il <PARTY> assecondi una iniziativa del <PARTY>, cercando di votare quell'emendamento sull'ex Ilva in Commissione, che per fortuna non è passato, con il parere contrario da parte del Ministero dello sviluppo economico, solo per pura demagogia, come appare chiaro dalle notizie di stampa delle ultime ore, di ieri e oggi. È evidente che i ritardi sulle operazioni di bonifica - è bene chiarirlo - delle aree dell'ex Ilva sono addebitabili a chi ne ha la competenza, e cioè alla gestione commissariale, che non abbiamo messo noi. I fondi a questo destinati ci sono, i soldi per le bonifiche ci sono, ma i commissari non stanno portando avanti il progetto e tutto va molto a rilento. La norma approvata nel decreto è stata ampiamente discussa con la Presidenza del Consiglio e con tutti i partiti di questa maggioranza presenti nella cabina di regia. Obiettivo del Governo e del ministro Giorgetti è dare una accelerazione al processo di decarbonizzazione, che si rende necessaria nell'interesse della città di Taranto, finalizzata a una produttività efficiente di un settore chiave della nostra economia, soprattutto in questo periodo storico, con l'aumento dei prezzi e la mancanza di materie prime.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.7034798264503479, 0.2965201735496521]}, {'sequence': \"Signor Presidente, colleghi, con l'approvazione della legge delega in esame, il Senato dà il via libera oggi a un intervento epocale, atteso da tanti, troppi anni, di riforma generale del mondo delle disabilità. <p> L'attuazione dei decreti previsti da questa legge delega porterà innumerevoli vantaggi, innanzitutto in termini di semplificazione. <p> Vi sarà un soggetto unico che eviterà al disabile di attraversare l'attuale giungla burocratica tra valutazioni ed esami di vari enti e soggetti che spesso si duplicano, si sovrappongono e generano rimpalli di competenze che paiono fatti apposta per far desistere chi, invece, dovrebbe semplicemente vedere riconosciuto un proprio diritto. Ciò significa anche avere la possibilità di pieno accesso ai servizi, alle prestazioni e alle agevolazioni finanziarie che permettono una maggiore autonomia e indipendenza, percorsi personalizzati per consentire una reale inclusione, che deve passare, ove possibile, dal pieno inserimento nel mondo del lavoro, che non deve essere una misura para-assistenziale, ma lo strumento per raggiungere la piena dignità dell'individuo, facendolo sentire parte attiva della società. <p> Anche l'approccio dell'abitare dovrà essere completamente rivisto, per permettere, tramite soluzioni ad hoc, la più ampia autosufficienza possibile. È un progetto ampio e ambizioso, ma è un percorso che dobbiamo iniziare a intraprendere, anche se consapevoli che il traguardo non sarà nell'immediato futuro: oggi dobbiamo avere la lungimiranza di colui che semina la pianta di datteri, sapendo che chi ne raccoglierà il frutto verrà dopo di lui. Tutto questo avviene sotto la forte spinta di questo Governo, che, mai come altri, sta prestando attenzione alla dura realtà di questa categoria, grazie unicamente - ciò va riconosciuto e sottolineato con orgoglio - alla forte richiesta della Lega di istituire un Ministero ad hoc, che potesse coordinare in maniera trasversale le politiche in materia, e soprattutto allo spessore e all'esperienza del ministro Erika Stefani, che in dieci mesi è stata in grado di mettere a terra tanti provvedimenti quanti non se ne erano mai visti negli ultimi dieci anni. <p> È a lei che, tramite il convinto plauso del Gruppo Lega, va il ringraziamento da parte di tutti i disabili. <p> Sono stati tanti i risultati già ottenuti ed è giusto ricordarli: l'incremento del fondo per la non autosufficienza, il fondo per l'inclusione, il riconoscimento della lingua dei segni italiana e della lingua dei segni tattile, la disability card, le maggiorazioni all'assegno unico universale per chi ha figli disabili e il ripristino degli assegni di invalidità a seguito della decisione di INPS che tagliava le pensioni agli invalidi parziali occupati. Anche nella legge di bilancio in esame ci saranno importanti interventi voluti dal Gruppo Lega per l'autismo, per i sordomuti, per l'Unione italiana dei cechi, nonché ulteriori fondi a disposizione del Ministero guidato dalla senatrice Stefani. Anche in occasione dell'emergenza Covid c'è stato un grande sforzo da parte del Ministro per prestare attenzione agli ultimi: ricordo la priorità vaccinale per le persone con disabilità, per i loro familiari caregiver, la possibilità per gli assistenti e gli accompagnatori di pazienti con disabilità di prestare loro sostegno in pronto soccorso e in ospedale, la didattica in presenza per gli alunni con disabilità anche in zona rossa, la distribuzione di mascherine trasparenti per le persone con disabilità uditiva e l'istituzione di un fondo ad hoc per garantire tamponi gratis per i cosiddetti fragili che non possono vaccinarsi. Lodevole anche il continuo sforzo in favore dei lavoratori fragili e dei lavoratori temporaneamente inidonei, anche se in questo caso dobbiamo registrare incomprensibili resistenze da parte dell'INPS e di altri Ministeri. Ancora oggi, nel pieno della quarta andata dell'epidemia, registriamo che le tutele necessarie non vengono assicurate con automatismo, ma vengono ancora una volta negate nei decreti e rimandate a un eventuale correttivo in fase di conversione parlamentare. Mi riferisco, nello specifico, all'esenzione dal lavoro e all'assenza equiparata al ricovero ospedaliero, senza incidenza sul compenso, che permette a chi non può lavorare in smart working di anteporre la salute all'attività lavorativa. Pagare l'indennità di malattia costa, ma se il Ministero dell'economia e finanze trova i fondi per ristorare chi rischia di fallire, li deve trovare anche per chi rischia di morire. <p> Mi avvio alla conclusione, Presidente. Deve essere inoltre detto all'INPS, con un chiara norma di legge, che, anche se raggiunto il limite del massimo indennizzabile contrattualmente previsto, l'indennità di malattia deve continuare ad essere erogata a chi, per decisione del medico, non può lavorare. In sede di discussione del disegno di legge di bilancio è possibile che venga accolto un emendamento del Gruppo Lega che prevede almeno un mese aggiuntivo e questo è importante, perché definisce il principio che quel limite non è un dogma insuperabile, ma ciò non basta. È inaccettabile che il Governo dica ai lavoratori fragili di stare a casa per tutelarsi dal Covid-19, ma di morire di fame, perché non sarà dato loro un euro. <p> Concludo richiamando Voltaire, il quale diceva: «Il grado di civiltà di un Paese si misura osservando le sue prigioni». Ebbene, non c'è peggior prigione, ossia limitazione di libertà, di quella che affronta il disabile che vi si trova soggetto, non per una propria colpa, ma per scelta del destino.

È una sfida, che abbiamo accettato sia dal punto di vista tecnico, visto che siamo entrati molto nella specifico, sia dal punto di vista politico, e lo abbiamo fatto in virtù del fatto che finalmente questa volta - e ricordo che si tratta di una legge delega - il Governo ha tenuto un approccio di discreta cautela verso il Parlamento e la Commissione. Abbiamo ricevuto una proposta del Governo, sulla quale abbiamo fatto le nostre considerazioni, e, di fatto, preso un foglio in bianco, abbiamo provato a riscriverla secondo la sensibilità della Commissione e del Parlamento. Ritengo dunque che giudiziosamente si possa considerare un buon lavoro. <p> Gli emendamenti che abbiamo presentato sono complementari a tutta quest\\'opera. Chiaramente, quello che stiamo trattando è talmente articolato e complesso che in questo momento forse non è la perfezione dello scritto che dobbiamo ricercare, ma il fatto di cambiare diametralmente visione per quanto riguarda il codice degli appalti e far uscire il nostro Paese da quel ginepraio che abbiamo conosciuto in questi lunghi anni. Da lì, nacque la necessità di fare la legge obiettivo: se infatti con la procedura ordinaria non si riescono a fare le opere, bisogna realizzarle con una procedura straordinaria, secondo la legge obiettivo, che nello spirito condividiamo e abbiamo condiviso. <p> È ovvio che, con questa sfida, vogliamo far sì che anche il nostro Paese si possa omologare alle normali prassi vigenti sulla faccia della terra, ovverosia che non vi siano procedure, a meno che non siano emergenziali, dovute a fatti contingenti, e che dunque fare appalti e opere rientri nella procedura normale di un Paese civile. È una grande sfida quella che abbiamo accettato nello scrivere questo testo, che - come poi dirò in maniera più ridondante in dichiarazione di voto - non è una delega in bianco che diamo al Governo, ma una fiducia che diamo a noi stessi e al Parlamento. Questo, dal mio punto di vista, è fondamentale. <p> Vi sono molte novità nelle linee guida di questa legge delega che ci aspettiamo di rileggere quando passeremo la palla al Governo, per vedere cosa vorrà fare. Non siamo assolutamente ostili al superamento della legge obiettivo, ma desidero differenziare il fatto che vi sono le opere strategiche e la legge obiettivo, che mi permetto di separare. Restano le opere strategiche, che di sicuro non sono esclusivamente identificabili nelle 25 opere che abbiamo visto nel DEF (tra cui, lo ricordo per chi ha poca memoria, vi è anche la tramvia di Firenze, che non è sicuramente un\\'opera strategica del Paese, e ne potremmo parlare per una settimana). <p> Detto questo, le opere strategiche necessarie ad un Paese devono avere la fortuna di essere realizzate in un Paese civile in cui la procedura ordinaria per la loro realizzazione abbia un percorso snello e produttivo. È sicuramente una sfida. <p> Gli emendamenti presentati ad abundantiam sono finalizzati ad un ulteriore miglioramento, se possibile, della presente legge delega. Ognuno poi può disquisire e fare le sue considerazioni: ci mancherebbe, siamo in democrazia. Trovare un pretesto per non condividere questo passaggio sarebbe stato semplice, ma credo sia riduttivo cercare di banalizzare il lavoro meticoloso e scrupoloso svolto in Commissione segnalando un\\'eventuale debolezza di questo documento e quindi presentando emendamenti che potrebbero apparire \"pretestuosi\". Il nostro è stato un atteggiamento cauto, morbido e comunque collaborativo; resta inteso che d\\'ora in avanti vigileremo, come abbiamo fatto nella stesura del testo e come faremo nella sua attuazione, affinché vi siano davvero le condizioni per poter dare al nostro Paese qualcosa che non sia proiettato nel futuro ma estremamente contemporaneo, perché purtroppo in questo momento non riusciamo neanche a vivere la contemporaneità in tema di necessità di una riforma del codice degli appalti. Sintetizzando, l\\'auspicio è che nel nostro Paese vi sia davvero la possibilità di non vedere più cose sulle quali ci siamo estremamente battuti. Non è possibile, aspetto riconducibile esclusivamente al nostro Paese, che opere del valore di 500 milioni di euro abbiano riserve superiori alla base d\\'asta; è qualcosa che non si trova da nessuna parte sulla faccia della terra, tant\\'è che in Italia le imprese e gli studi di progettazione hanno più avvocati che tecnici. Siamo l\\'unico Paese che ha i riservisti, quelli che prima ancora di iniziare l\\'opera fanno le riserve. Al riguardo ho presentato un emendamento, che non verrà accettato perché forse è un po\\' provocatorio, finalizzato alla creazione di una bad list delle imprese che utilizzano il sistema delle riserve in maniera scientifica, a prescindere dal progetto. Quanto al ricorso all\\'appalto integrato - anche questo prerogativa del nostro Paese perché, salvo casi davvero specifici per realizzazioni molto particolari dal punto di visto tecnico e tecnologico, non esiste in nessun altro posto sulla faccia della terra o perlomeno non esiste in Europa o nei Paesi occidentali - noi della Lega ne abbiamo proposto da subito un utilizzo moderato se non l\\'abolizione. Tale richiesta è stata condivisa nella maggior parte dei casi da tutti gli auditi in Commissione, in prima persona da Cantone. Non è stata condivisa dall\\'amministratore delegato delle Ferrovie dello Stato e ciò la dice lunga, dal mio punto di vista, sul fallimento di certe opere realizzate con appalto integrato. Credo infatti che il primo atto che qualsiasi tipo di amministrazione debba compiere nell\\'approcciare un\\'opera, strategica o meno, è avere la certezza di dove voglia andare e cosa voglia fare. Pertanto, il primo mandato da conferire è quello relativo alla progettazione in modo da poter decidere, fino all\\'ultimo chiodo, tutte le caratteristiche dell\\'opera e mettere in condizioni chi concorrerà alla sua realizzazione di poterlo fare ad armi pari: chi sarà più bravo si aggiudicherà infine l\\'esecuzione dell\\'opera, come accade nel resto del mondo. Concludo dicendo che è un passo avanti importante per il Paese, una sfida. Io ho la certezza che esistono le caratteristiche e le condizioni per superare questa sfida, se le carte saranno scritte dal Governo nella maniera giusta. Noi abbiamo nel Paese tecnici e imprese che all\\'estero ottengono ottimi risultati, cosa che non riescono a fare nel nostro Paese per il ginepraio che tutti conosciamo. Questa è l\\'anomalia e anche ciò che lascia l\\'amaro in bocca a tutti quanti. È una sfida importante che dal punto di vista politico, condividiamo - e ringrazio ancora una volta il Vice Ministro, nonché il Presidente della Commissione e il relatore - per la collaborazione avuta. Siamo riusciti, per una volta, a tenere un po\\' distante l\\'approccio eccessivamente invasivo che il Governo ha sempre in queste occasioni. Speriamo di non essere delusi in una seconda fase, e lo vedremo. Non vogliamo fare nessun processo alle intenzioni. Per quanto riguarda gli emendamenti, mi riservo di intervenire in dichiarazione di voto su quelli che ci stanno particolarmente a cuore e sono relativi a settori specifici.

Segnalo quanto detto in particolare dai senatori Malan e Bernini sulla necessità di un approccio che miri alla prevenzione, anziché alla burocratizzazione, ed eviti un aumento di pene che poi restano soltanto sulla carta. <p> Il secondo grande orientamento che emerge e sul quale pure vi è ampia condivisione è relativo alla responsabilità, che richiede - com'è stato detto - «comprensione» e «sensibilizzazione», le importanti espressioni usate che mi sono appuntato.

Siamo tutti d'accordo, anche in questo caso, sulla necessità e centralità del ruolo della scuola. Alcuni hanno messo in evidenza - in particolare la senatrice Serra - la difficoltà d'intervenire con efficacia in presenza di fondi - a dirla diplomaticamente - piuttosto scarni. Si può vedere il bicchiere anche mezzo pieno sotto questo profilo: la legge intende compiere un'operazione di grande importanza a costi estremamente ridotti per la collettività. È un primo passo. Naturalmente tutti vorremmo dedicare maggiori risorse. Dopo aver ascoltato l'intervento della senatrice Serra, potremmo definire quella in esame una sorta di «legge Ikea»: si può fare molto con poco; certamente, tutti vorrebbero mobili più pregiati, ma meglio avere quello che passa il convento e cercare di mettere in moto un processo virtuoso, piuttosto che non avere niente. <p> In tal senso, mi è piaciuto moltissimo sentire la disponibilità di tutti ad approvare il provvedimento.

Se il fatturato è superiore al 30 per cento di quello complessivo, tali cooperative sociali sono considerate operatori dell'agricoltura sociale in proporzione allo stesso fatturato agricolo. <p> Le attività di agricoltura sociale possono essere svolte in associazione con cooperative, imprese sociali, associazioni di promozione sociale, soggetti pubblici, organismi della cooperazione, organizzazioni di volontariato, associazioni ed enti di promozione sociale, fondazioni, enti di patronato e altri soggetti privati. <p> La normativa prevede che le attività di agricoltura sociale siano realizzate in collaborazione con i servizi socio-sanitari, coniugandosi ovviamente con l'intervento delle Regioni, che già autonomamente hanno provveduto a dotarsi di una propria regolamentazione. Alcune Regioni, come il Veneto, la Liguria, la Toscana, le Marche, l'Abruzzo e la Campania, hanno già cominciato a operare, sebbene in via del tutto sperimentale, con risultati abbastanza soddisfacenti, e tutto questo si va a intersecare con la regolamentazione del terzo settore e la legge n. 381 del 1991, che ogni anno trasferisce alle Regioni numerosi finanziamenti. <p> Gli enti pubblici competenti per il territorio, nel quadro della programmazione delle proprie funzioni inerenti alle attività agricole e sociali, promuovono, senza nuovi o maggiori oneri per la finanza pubblica, politiche integrate tra imprese, produttori agricoli e istituzioni locali al fine di sviluppare l'agricoltura sociale. <p> Il provvedimento arriva in Aula forse un po' tardivamente (ha impiegato quasi dodici mesi) e nel frattempo, come dicevo prima, alcune Regioni hanno già cominciato ad attivarsi con gli stessi principi. È previsto inoltre che le Regioni adeguino le proprie disposizioni in materia di programmazione della rete locale delle prestazioni e dei servizi, al fine di permettere il riconoscimento degli operatori dell'agricoltura sociale presso gli enti preposti. Il monitoraggio e la valutazione dei servizi e delle prestazioni avvengono secondo le disposizioni previste dal soggetto competente per il riconoscimento. Le imprese riconosciute sono iscritte in un elenco ufficiale costituito a livello regionale. <p> È stata invece soppressa la parte relativa al potere sostitutivo dello Stato nei confronti delle Regioni nel caso di inadempienza nel riconoscimento degli operatori. Gli operatori dell'agricoltura sociale possono costituire organizzazioni dì produttori (OP) per prodotti dell'agricoltura sociale. <p> I fabbricati o le porzioni di fabbricati rurali già esistenti nel fondo, destinati dagli imprenditori agricoli all'esercizio dell'attività di agricoltura sociale, mantengono il riconoscimento di ruralità. Le Regioni possono promuovere l'utilizzo del patrimonio immobiliare esistente nel rispetto delle caratteristiche tipologiche, architettoniche e paesaggistico-ambientali dei luoghi. <p> Per quanto riguarda gli interventi di sostegno, le istituzioni pubbliche che gestiscono mense scolastiche e ospedaliere hanno facoltà di inserire come criteri di priorità per l'assegnazione delle gare di fornitura, la provenienza dei prodotti agroalimentari da operatori di agricoltura sociale, nel rispetto della normativa sulla razionalizzazione e il contenimento della spesa per beni e servizi. I Comuni dovranno definire le modalità idonee di presenza e di valorizzazione dei prodotti provenienti dall'agricoltura sociale nelle aree pubbliche. <p> Nell'ambito delle operazioni di alienazione e locazione dei terreni demaniali agricoli e di quelli appartenenti agli enti pubblici territoriali e non territoriali sono previsti criteri di priorità per favorire l'insediamento e lo sviluppo delle attività di agricoltura sociale, anche utilizzando i beni e terreni confiscati ai sensi del codice delle leggi antimafia e delle misure di prevenzione. Gli enti pubblici territoriali possono dare in concessione a titolo gratuito anche agli operatori dell'agricoltura sociale i beni immobili confiscati alla criminalità organizzata. <p> Le Regioni, nell'ambito dei piani di sviluppo rurale, possono promuovere la realizzazione di programmi finalizzati allo sviluppo della multifunzionalità delle imprese agricole, con particolare riguardo alle pratiche di progettazione integrata territoriale e allo sviluppo dell'agricoltura sociale. A tal fine, le stesse Regioni promuovono tavoli di partenariato tra i soggetti interessati al settore dell'agricoltura sociale. Le Regioni e le Province autonome devono adottare appositi provvedimenti di sostegno alle attività di agricoltura sociale. <p> Forza Italia torna comunque fortemente a lamentare la scarsa attenzione del Governo nei confronti di un settore che in questo momento è altamente in crisi.

Fu una grande opportunità di conoscere, di ridere, di divertirsi. È in RAI che sono nati personaggi che hanno fatto la storia del nostro Paese: registi, cantanti, attori, comici. E anche la politica, con la televisione, ha potuto raggiungere le case di tutti gli italiani. Non c'è dubbio che la televisione e la RAI hanno avuto un ruolo determinante nella crescita e nella formazione degli italiani, nella costruzione della identità culturale e sociale del nostro Paese, così come non c'è alcun dubbio se diciamo che oggi la RAI ha perso via via quel carattere, quel ruolo e quella funzione. <p> Oggi viviamo nella società della comunicazione; siamo inondati da informazioni, messaggi, immagini, ma con ciò non abbiamo più cultura diffusa; non abbiamo cittadini più consapevoli, anzi rischiamo di avere solo tanti individui che fanno fatica a riconoscersi in una comunità e in un progetto comune. La RAI perciò a questo deve contribuire. Per farlo deve cambiare, noi politici dobbiamo cambiare capendo che oggi il nostro Paese ha bisogno di un servizio pubblico all'avanguardia e innovativo e per questo dobbiamo liberare la RAI da quel male italico che si chiama burocrazia e spartizione. Occorre cioè più politica con la «p» maiuscola e non meno politica e più volontà di cambiamento. La rivoluzione è una perpetua sfida alle incrostazioni dell'abitudine, all'insolenza dell'autorità incontestata, alla compiacente idolizzazione di sé e dei miti imposti dai mezzi d'informazione. Per questo la rivoluzione deve essere un evento normale, un continuo rinnovamento, un continuo riflettere e fare, discutere e fare. Così diceva un uomo, un maestro che ha reso importante il servizio pubblico per milioni di persone. Parlo del maestro Manzi. Permettetemi di citarlo per raccontare quello che è stato anche il nostro lavoro in Commissione. <p> La rivoluzione - dicevo - deve essere un evento normale, un riflettere e un fare, discutere e fare. Fare non è solo un verbo renziano, come pure si crede, irridendo al riguardo in questi ultimi tempi. Fare è il principio e il cardine di qualunque volontà di cambiare. Il fare in Commissione ha prodotto il testo che portiamo oggi in quest'Aula. È un fare in gran parte condiviso o in buona parte condiviso; non è inciucio; è un fare che vuole ricordare e riportare lo scopo e la ragione di un servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo. Rientra in questa politica del fare la riforma del management dell'azienda, dando autonomia e potere all'amministratore delegato, che dovrà essere a quel livello professionale e personale tali da farci ricordare e non rimpiangere personaggi illustri che hanno fatto grande la RAI. Uno fra tutti è il nostro collega Sergio Zavoli. <p> AIROLA (<PARTY>). Anche Renzi dovrebbe ascoltarlo. CANTINI (<PARTY>). Parliamo di una politica che cerca, come abbiamo fatto in Commissione, di trovare soluzioni insieme perché il futuro consiglio di amministrazione possa essere, nella sommatoria delle nomine fatte da Camera, Senato, Governo e lavoratori RAI, qualificato e plurale; di una politica che sottopone in maniera trasparente i curriculum degli aspiranti consiglieri d'amministrazione al giudizio pubblico perché i curriculum sottoposti alla Camera e al Senato saranno pubblicati nei siti istituzionali e resi pubblici prima dell'inizio dell'analisi, come avviene a seguito dell'approvazione di un mio e di altri emendamenti confluiti nel disegno di legge oggi in Aula, che stabilisce delle norme chiare di incompatibilità per l'amministratore delegato. Tuttavia, con questo provvedimento facciamo solo una prima parte del lavoro che serve, ma era urgente che, fin dal rinnovo del consiglio di amministrazione già scaduto, potessimo dare il segno di discontinuità e soprattutto tracciare le linee del progetto di riforma. Oggi approviamo le norme per il rinnovo della governance, ma dovremo procedere con la riforma del canone e con il nuovo contratto di servizio. Il professor Pitruzzella, presidente dell'Autorità garante della concorrenza e del mercato durante 1'audizione nella nostra Commissione, ci ha ricordato come 1'evoluzione tecnologica e lo sviluppo dei servizi audiovisivi on line, pure importantissimi, non hanno ancora scalfito la centralità del settore televisivo tradizionale sia sotto il profilo sociale che sotto il profilo economico: la televisione è infatti tuttora la più grande industria editoriale italiana, il primo medium per investimenti pubblicitari e il tempo dedicato dal pubblico alla televisione cresce. Il settore mantiene ancora un ruolo centrale nella filiera di produzione dei contenuti. Dato questo scenario, appare quindi importante partire con il dare alla RAI una nuova guida chiara, riconosciuta, trasparente, efficiente e responsabilizzata: un capo azienda capace di prendere le decisioni, ma anche di essere chiamato a risponderne e di offrire un nuovo linguaggio editoriale che sia fruibile a tutti, ma al contempo di contenuti e crescita, e che sia volano del nostro modello produttivo e della bellezza del nostro territorio, dei prodotti che da questo territorio nascono e dell'incanto che ogni angolo del nostro Paese offre. Occorre una linea editoriale che non sia ridondante e che riesca ad eliminare costi inutili, anche con la riforma delle testate giornalistiche. È questa una modernizzazione necessaria, volta ad adeguare il modello produttivo delle news agli standard internazionali, con meno testate e più produzione di reportage e documentari. Certo, la prova se saremo riusciti nel nostro intento l'avremo quando potremo verificare la qualità delle nuove nomine e la validità del progetto, della missione e del nuovo palinsesto. Dipenderà però da noi se sapremo essere conseguenti a quello che abbiamo scritto in questo provvedimento. Infatti, nel disegno di legge che discutiamo in Aula è chiaro il profilo a cui dobbiamo ispirare le nomine: professionisti, donne e uomini qualificati, i migliori. È anche chiara la missione a cui ci ispiriamo. Se sapremo essere all'altezza della sfida che con questo disegno di legge lanciamo a noi stessi e al Paese, avremo avviato e in parte realizzato un'altra delle riforme strategiche per il Paese. Anche per questo motivo, abbiamo ricercato convergenze in Commissione. Infatti, siamo ostinatamente convinti che le riforme importanti si debbano fare insieme, perché solo così potremo far uscire il nostro Paese da questa triste fase in cui prevalgono ancora la ricerca dello scontro, l'odio e la voglia di distruggere rispetto alla volontà di costruire. Abbiamo bisogno di costruire e su questo dovremmo impiegare tutte le nostre energie, dividerci, discutere e confrontarci, per costruire una RAI che sappia fare cultura e non si adegui ai livelli più bassi del mercato, ma che sia, tramite produzioni proprie, un motore di eccellenza ed un punto di rinascita dell'economia del nostro Paese, tramite quel mercato culturale di cui tanto si parla, a volte però senza riscontri oggettivi. La RAI può e deve acquisire un nuovo profilo internazionale, anche attraverso la produzione di programmi in lingua inglese e la creazione di un canale culturale all'altezza dei migliori esempi europei. Con questo provvedimento facciamo un altro passo verso il cambiamento. Tanto resta ancora da fare - non ce lo nascondiamo - ma sono certa che solo da questa ed altre fatiche nascerà il Paese che vogliamo: un Paese migliore, più giusto e moderno, all'avanguardia e di esempio in Europa e nel mondo\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5034434795379639, 0.49655652046203613]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> TOCCI (<PARTY>).

Noi sappiamo che il documento in esame arriva dal Governo Conte e purtroppo il nuovo Esecutivo deve anche portarlo avanti. Sappiamo perfettamente che ci sono stati errori da parte del Governo Conte. Finanche la Merkel, qualche giorno fa, ha fatto un passo indietro sul lockdown e ha chiesto scusa, perché lo stesso avrebbe creato davvero un grande disagio sia ai cittadini sia all'economia. Sappiamo che non basta soltanto parlare di recovery: servono soprattutto progetti e idee, ma non ne vediamo tante; ne vediamo soprattutto da parte degli italiani, che stanno partecipando a questo dibattito con grande stanchezza. Il Piano, come dicevo prima, è stato impostato dal Governo Conte; il Parlamento sta facendo un grande lavoro, soprattutto perché è un documento vecchio e superato, che non sarà presentato. Ecco perché noi di <PARTY> avremmo voluto un approccio completamente diverso e un pieno coinvolgimento del Parlamento, anche per presentare migliorie attraverso gli emendamenti. Per quanto concerne nello specifico gli aspetti concernenti l'ambiente, sicuramente un punto fondamentale sarebbe lavorare alla modifica del superbonus al 110 per cento, perché sappiamo che è uno strumento sicuramente importante a cui le famiglie e le aziende vorrebbero attingere. Purtroppo, però, la burocrazia limita molto in questo senso. Solo per fare esempi concreti, dei 6 miliardi di euro di detrazione previsti sono stati utilizzati solamente 340 milioni di euro in detrazione per finanziare soltanto 3.100 interventi in tutto il Paese. Sono certamente numeri molto bassi, mentre in teoria - lo ribadisco - questo strumento potrebbe comportare un effetto totale sull'economia di circa 21 miliardi di euro. Bisogna lavorare - è fondamentale ed è uno dei temi che ho affrontato in Commissione ambiente e che continuo a sottolineare - soprattutto a una semplificazione dei vari procedimenti amministrativi. Questa è una condizione prodromica al buon esito di tutte le iniziative volte a rilanciare l'economia. Un'altra proposta è l'estensione del superbonus 110 per cento anche ad altre tipologie di immobili oggi escluse. Penso soprattutto al turismo, quindi alle strutture ricettive e agli alberghi che in questo momento stanno soffrendo. Bisogna estendere e soprattutto concedere una proroga, anche perché quindici mesi sono effettivamente pochi. Imperdonabile - e concludo, Signor Presidente - è l'assenza in questo recovery plan delle politiche giovanili. Permettetemi di dire che hanno fatto sicuramente bene la Spagna, la Francia e anche il Portogallo: bisogna dare una prospettiva e un Governo deve avere anche lungimiranza nell'aiutare i nostri giovani. Questo non sarebbe un drammatico errore, ma una terribile occasione fallita, perché un Governo che non dà la possibilità ai giovani di rimanere in questo Paese di sicuro ha fallito completamente con le sue proposte.\", 'labels': [0, 1], 'scores': [0.5116704702377319, 0.4883294999599457]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare per dichiarazione di voto. <p> STEFANI (<PARTY>).

Lo stesso presidente Gasparri ha ricordato che questa non è vicenda nuova. Ci sono stati conflitti di attribuzione e c'è un'amplissima giurisprudenza della Corte costituzionale in materia da cui non si può prescindere. Noi sappiamo che, dal punto di vista della Corte costituzionale, le norme, così come sono in questo momento, consentono il ricorso all'insindacabilità soltanto quando le esternazioni, le dichiarazioni extra moenia, siano un'amplificazione coerente e puntuale dell'attività parlamentare svolta intra moenia. Questo è un fatto. Quindi, nel momento in cui il relatore, chiunque sia, deve affrontare una materia di tal genere, non può prescindere da siffatta cornice. Aggiungo anche che ci sarebbe uno spazio che dipende molto dai tempi in cui avviene la dichiarazione extra moenia, e cioè esiste la possibilità che un parlamentare svolga un intervento extra moenia seguito a brevissima distanza da una dichiarazione in Parlamento. In quel caso si può a buon diritto ancora invocare l'insindacabilità. La fattispecie di fronte alla quale ci troviamo - come ho già detto nella relazione - è completamente diversa e quindi, doverosamente, chiunque si trovi a svolgere la funzione di relatore in casi come questi non può che tenere conto delle regole suddette. Poi vi è un altro problema, che è quello che ha posto il senatore Giarrusso. Anche su esso credo che per il relatore sia doveroso replicare. Il senatore Giarrusso, oggi, ci dice - in maniera un po' tonitruante - che non ha alcuna intenzione di sottrarsi al giudizio di merito e, nella sostanza, ribadisce e amplifica ulteriormente - questa volta in Parlamento e, quindi, siamo di fronte a un'attività parlamentare coperta, questa sì, da insindacabilità - le tesi che gli sono state attribuite dal querelante. Effettivamente in quel di Agira esiste, cioè, una contiguità - come ci ha spiegato - tra un politico e un pregiudicato che ha parenti mafiosi e che intende rivendicare queste sue dichiarazioni in giudizio, sede nella quale addirittura si dichiara convinto che sarà condannata la controparte. Ora, è evidente che in sede di replica diventa inevitabile, però, porre al senatore Giarrusso alcune domande molto semplici dal punto di vista proprio del relatore. Non mi riferisco tanto al perché il 24 maggio 2015 abbia eccepito l'insindacabilità del suo comportamento davanti al giudice. Fin lì arriviamo a capire che si è trattato di una risposta politica, nel senso che è stata eccepita l'insindacabilità davanti al giudice perché il senatore Giarrusso cercava di rendere visibile il caso a livello nazionale. E, quindi, si è trattato di una specie di strepitus fori politico, una ricerca di attenzione sul caso di Agira perseguita attraverso la possibilità di venire in Giunta e in Aula a dirci quanto ha detto. E su questo non ho nulla da eccepire. Sul piano, però, della correttezza formale e dei rapporti che dobbiamo avere al Senato e tra di noi all'interno della Giunta, della quale Giarrusso è un autorevole membro, la domanda di fondo è la seguente: per quale motivo il 23 giugno 2016 e il 29 giugno 2016 è stato imposto un lavoro alla Giunta e al sottoscritto per verificare se i motivi dell'insindacabilità invocata da Giarrusso fossero fondati o no dal punto di vista giuridico e formale? Questa è una domanda importante, perché l'utilizzo del Senato della Repubblica come cassa di risonanza per mettere in evidenza la situazione di un territorio attraverso lo strumento del trascinamento in Giunta di un caso che, tra l'altro, risale al 2015 - quindi, aggiungiamo che la querela è ferma da più di un anno - è già ai limiti, ma non spetta a me giudicarlo. Ma se davvero il problema è quello che oggi ci racconta il senatore Giarrusso in Aula, chiedo per quale motivo siamo stati per oltre un mese a verificare quando e se avesse presentato la sua interrogazione e se fosse o no un motivo di insindacabilità; quando e se fosse effettivamente presente una scriminante dei suoi diritti di esprimere le sue opinioni politiche; quando e se vi fosse un'insussistenza o un'indeterminatezza del destinatario delle sue accuse che oggi con chiarezza ci ha spiegato in Aula che pare non ci sia. Questo elemento in sede di replica non posso non metterlo in evidenza, perché altrimenti, signor Presidente, sembriamo tutti matti. Sembrerebbe quasi che io abbia svolto una relazione perché mi sono inventato, o l'Assemblea si è inventata, una richiesta di insindacabilità, che invece è stata motivata, seppure - come abbiamo cercato di dimostrare nella relazione - in maniera non fondata dal nostro punto di vista. È come se qualcuno oggi avesse accusato la Giunta di avere travisato delle intenzioni che sono chiare, scritte e firmate. Persino rispetto all'interrogazione nessuno ha affermato, accusando il collega Giarrusso, che fosse un scudo per evitare il problema della querela. È il senatore Giarrusso che l'ha utilizzata come uno scudo spiegandoci che l'aveva presentata otto mesi dopo, altrimenti non l'avrei mai citata; mai mi sarei permesso e mai mi sarebbe venuto in mente. <p> Ora, non è che tutto questo non sia permesso. Per carità, Presidente, tutti ci possono ripensare e non c'è nulla di strano. D'altronde, da questo punto di vista non c'è giurisprudenza. C'è solo il Nuovo Testamento che ha perdonato San Pietro perché, per tre volte, ha rinnegato Gesù. Insomma, nel caso di specie, c'è almeno il numero tre come limite della possibilità di rinnegare qualcosa o di ripensarci. <p> Il problema di fondo, però, è che credo, anche per la qualità del lavoro che dobbiamo svolgere in Giunta, che sarebbe più opportuno per il futuro che, ove si ritenga più importante andare in giudizio - e a mio avviso giustamente, perché tra l'altro nonostante i toni, può anche convincermi il discorso del senatore Giarrusso - perché potrebbe diventare una sede di confronto politico, e si è pronti a sfidare quel processo, si è sicuri di uscire da esso con le proprie ragioni rafforzate e con il proprio avversario politico smascherato in una sua impresentabilità che ha cercato di nascondere, benissimo, facciamolo. Ma facciamolo, però, perlomeno il 27 maggio del 2015, e non un anno dopo in Assemblea, senza neanche dirlo in Giunta, tra l'altro anche per rispetto nei suoi confronti. <p> Non credo che la Giunta delle elezioni del Senato possa sapere da un comunicato stampa che una persona voglia rinunciare all'insindacabilità nel giorno stesso in cui se ne sta discutendo. È una questione formale, ma la forma è sostanza quando si tratta di un organismo delicato come quello che noi siamo chiamati a gestire per conto del Senato della Repubblica. Ed è una questione che inevitabilmente, in sede di replica, avevo il dovere di mettere in evidenza.\", 'labels': [1, 0], 'scores': [0.6400513648986816, 0.35994860529899597]}, {'sequence': \"Domando di parlare. <p> SPILABOTTE (<PARTY>). Signora Presidente, mi dispiace svolgere questo intervento proprio la vigilia della giornata internazionale della donna, ma devo fare una pubblica denuncia, perché sul profilo Facebook di un certo Mario Salieri, uno dei registi più in voga del genere porno, è apparsa la promozione di un film intitolato «La Ciociara» liberamente ispirato, a quanto dice lo stesso regista, al film di De Sica «La Ciociara». Quest'ultimo aveva come protagonista Sofia Loren e denunciava le cosiddette marocchinate degli anni 1943-1944, durante la Seconda guerra mondiale, quando ben 60.000 persone, tra uomini, donne e bambini, subirono violenze inaudite (che in alcuni casi portarono anche alla morte) da parte dei soldati marocchini inquadrati nelle truppe francesi, che, come premio per aver liberato queste terre dal nazifascismo, avevano avuto la libertà di azione per cinquanta ore sul nostro territorio. Questa libertà di azione si è trasformata nella razzia di questi territori e nella violenza di gruppo nei confronti di uomini, donne e bambini. Questo regista, Mario Salieri, propone una versione liberamente ispirata al film di De Sica e l'attrice protagonista, una certa Roberta Gemma, è un'indiscussa star del genere hard. Chiedo quindi attenzione da parte di quest'Assemblea; presenterò anche un atto di sindacato ispettivo. E chiedo altresì un intervento urgente da parte del Ministero dei beni e delle attività culturali e del turismo, attraverso la sua direzione generale del cinema, che ha la capacità di approvare la diffusione, imporre divieti o negare il nulla osta qualora l'opera cinematografica rappresenti un'offesa al buoncostume. Penso che, oltre all'offesa al buon costume, questa opera cinematografica - se tale si può definire - rechi veramente offesa alla memoria e alla sofferenza di tante persone, spesso dimenticate, che hanno dovuto subire questa barbarie.
